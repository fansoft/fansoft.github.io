Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone

Scene:

A neighbourhood on a street called Privet Drive. An owl, sitting on the street sign flies off to reveal a mysterious appearing old man walking through a forest near the street. 
He stops at the start of the street and takes out a mechanical device and zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. 
The man, ALBUS DUMBLEDORE, looks down at the cat, which is a tabby and is sitting on a brick ledge.

Dumbledore: I should have known that you would be here...Professor McGonagall.

The cat meows, sniffs out and the camera pans back to a wall. The cats shadow is seen progressing into a human. There are footsteps and MINERVA MCGONAGALL is revealed.

McGonagall: Good evening, Professor Dumbledore. Are the rumours true, Albus?

Dumbledore: I'm afraid so, Professor. The good, and the bad.

McGonagall: And the boy?

Dumbledore: Hagrid is bringing him.

McGonagall: Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?

Albus: Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid with my life.

There is a motor sound, and the two professors look up to see a flying motorcycle coming down from the air. It skids on the street and halts. A large man, RUBEUS HAGRID, takes off his goggles.

Hagrid: Professor Dumbledore, Sir. Professor McGonagall.

Dumbledore: No problems, I trust, Hagrid?

Hagrid: No, sir. Little tyke fell asleep just as we were flying over Bristol. Heh. Try not to wake him. There you go.

Hagrid hands a baby in a blanket over to Dumbledore.

McGonagall: Albus, do you really think its safe, leaving him with these people? I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They really are

Dumbledore: The only family he has.

They stop outside a house.

McGonagall: This boy will be famous. There wont be a child in our world who doesn't know his name.

Dumbledore: Exactly. He's better off growing up away from all that. Until he is ready.

Hagrid coughs and sniffles, he is crying. He clears his throat.

Dumbledore: There, there, Hagrid. It's not really good-bye, after all.

Hagrid nods. Dumbledore takes a letter and places it on the baby, who is now at the foot of the door. The baby has a visible lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.

Dumbledore: Good luck...Harry Potter.



The camera pans into the scar and the opening title shows:

HARRY POTTER AND THE PHILOSOPHER'S STONE

Almost ten years after the: DURSLEY's home. The camera pans on a sleeping boy, almost eleven, with a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead.

There is a click, and knocking. Outside, a tall woman, PETUNIA DURSLEY, raps the door.

Petunia: Up. Get up. {Knocks} {sighs} Now! {Smacks door of closet which is the boys bedroom}

A large, tubby boy, DUDLEY DURSLEY, suddenly comes running down the stairs above the closet. He stops half-way down and goes back, jumping on the staircase.

Dudley: Wake up, cousin! We're going to the zoo!

Dudley laughs, comes down the stairs and runs for the kitchen. The boy, HARRY POTTER, tries to come out of the closet, but is pushed back in by Dudley.

Petunia is in the kitchen, where Dudley has gone.

Petunia: Oh, here he comes, the birthday boy!

A larger man, VERNON DURSLEY, is sitting at the kitchen table.

Vernon: Happy birthday, son.

Petunia and Dudley giggle together. Harry comes into the kitchen, dressed in rags.

Petunia: Why don't you just cook the breakfast, and try not to burn anything.

Harry: Yes, Aunt Petunia.

He sets to work.

Petunia: I want everything to be perfect for my Dudley's special day.

Vernon: Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy!

Harry: Yes, Uncle Vernon.

Petunia leads Dudley over to the family room, where there are a vast amount of presents. Dudley stares.

Dudley: How many are there?

Vernon: Thirty-six. Counted 'em myself.

Dudley: Thirty-six?! But last year last year I got thirty-seven!!

Vernon: Yes, well, some of them are quite a bit bigger than last year!

Dudley: I don't care how big they are!

Petunia: Oh, now, now, now. This is what we're going to do, is that when we go out we're going to buy you two new presents! How's that, Pumpkin?

 

Scene:

Outside, morning. The happy family is heading to the car. Harry goes to get in but is stopped by Vernon.

 

Petunia: This will be a lovely day at the zoo. I'm really looking forward to it.

Vernon: I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you won't have any meals for a week. Get in.

 

Scene:

The zoo. The family is in the reptile house, looking at a large BOA CONSTRICTOR.

 

Dudley: Make it move.

Vernon raps the glass of the cage.

 

Vernon: Move!

 

Dudley raps the glass much harder, and Vernon winces.

 

Dudley: MOVE!

Harry: He's asleep!

Dudley: He's boring.

 

Dudley and his parents retreat to another enclosure. Harry is left with the snake.

 

Harry: Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you.

 

The snake looks up and blinks.

 

Harry: Can you...hear me? {The snake nods} It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? {The snake shakes its head} You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? {The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity} I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.

 

The now awake snake has attracted Dudley's attention. He rips over to the cage, knocking Harry to the floor.

 

Dudley: Mummy, dad, come here! You won't believe what this snake is doing!!

 

Dudley puts his hands on the glass wall. Harry, from the ground, glares at him. Suddenly, the glass disappears. Dudley wretches forward.

 

Dudley: Whoa! Ahh! Ahh!!

 

Dudley falls into the snake enclosure, sputtering in a pool of water. The snake gets out of the exhibit, stopping in front of Harry.

 

Snake: Thankssssssss.

Harry: Anytime.

 

The snake starts off.

 

Man: SNAKE!

 

There is a lot of screaming as the snake heads for freedom. Dudley gets up to get out, but the glass is now back over the enclosure. He is stuck. He pounds the glass.

 

Dudley: Mum, mummy!

Petunia: {Sees him} AHH!

Dudley: Mum, help! Help me!

Petunia: My darling boy! How did you get in there?!

Harry: {Grins and giggles}

 

Vernon glares down at him and Harry's grin disappears. Petunia continues screaming: How did you get in there? Dursley, oh, Dursley!

 

Scene:

Back at the Dursley's. Petunia and a bundled up Dudley come in.

Petunia: It's all right. It's all right.

 

They disappear around the corner. Harry and Vernon enter. Vernon slams the door and shoves Harry against a wall, taking his hair.

 

Harry: Ow!

Vernon: What happened?

Harry: I swear I don't know! One minute the glass was there and then it was gone! It was like magic!

Vernon: {Scoffs and shoves Harry into the closet} There's no such thing as magic!

 

Scene:

Outside, some time later. An owl flies by the house and drops a letter, which zooms in the letterbox. It lands away from the house and hoots.

Harry, inside, goes to collect the mail. He sorts through the letters and sees his, addressed to him. He goes into the kitchen, hands Vernon the rest of the mail, and walks around the other side of the table to see his letter.

 

Vernon: Ah, Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

Dudley: {Sees Harrys letter. He runs and grabs it} Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!!

Harry: Hey, give it back! It's mine!

Vernon: {Laughs} Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

 

The family gathers to look at the address. There is a broken seal on the letter. The family looks up and Harry gulps.

 

Scene:

Another owl flies by with a letter and drops it off. Inside, Vernon grabs a handful of letters and rips them up.

In the closet, Harry hears a whirring noise. He looks out at Vernon drilling wood over the letterbox opening.

 

Vernon: No more mail through this letterbox.

 

Scene:

Outside, Vernon and Petunia appear. Vernon is about to head off to work. Petunia kisses his cheek.

 

Petunia: Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

 

She stops, looks and sees a bunch of owls.

 

Vernon: Shoo! Go on!

 

Scene:

Inside. Vernon is tossing letters into the fireplace. Harry comes around the corner. Vernon grins evilly and tosses more in.

 

Scene:

Living/Family room. The family is sitting around, Harry is serving cookies.

 

Vernon: Fine day Sunday. In my opinion, best day of the week. Why is that, Dudley?

 

Dudley shrugs.

 

Harry: {Hands cookie to Vernon} Because there's no post on Sunday? Ah, right you are, Harry. No post on Sunday. Hah! No blasted letters today. No, sir. {Harry sees a shadow outside the window. Outside, millions of owls are perched.} No sir, not one blasted, miserable---

 

A letter shoots out of the fireplace and zips across Vernons face. There is a rumbling and then zillions of letters come shooting out of the fireplace.

 

Dudley: AHH! Make it stop! Please make it stop! {He jumps on Petunias lap}

Petunia and Vernon: {Screaming}

Vernon: Go away, ahh!

Dudley: What is it? Please tell me what's happening!

 

Harry jumps onto the coffee table to grab a letter. He gets one and starts to run away. Vernon jumps up as well.

 

Vernon: Give me that! Give me that letter!

 

He chases Harry and grabs him before Harry gets into his closet.

 

Harry: Get off! Ahh!

Vernon: Ahh!

Harry: They're my letters! Let go of me!

Vernon: That's it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!

Dudley: Daddy's gone mad, hasnt he?!

 

Scene:

A house, on a rock island somewhere out at sea. The family is sleeping, with Harry on the cold, dirt floor. He has drawn a birthday cake which reads, Happy Birthday Harry. Harry looks at Dudley's watch, which beeps 12:00.

 

Harry: Make a wish, Harry. {Blows}

 

Suddenly, the door thumps. Harry jumps. The door thumps again and Dudley and Harry jump up and back away. Petunia and Vernon appear, Vernon with a gun. The door bangs again and then cracks open, and a giant man appears.

 

Vernon: Who's there? Ahh!

Hagrid: Sorry 'bout that. {He puts the door back up}

Vernon: I demand that you leave at once, Sir! You are breaking and entering!

Petunia: Ooh.

 

Hagrid comes over, grabs the gun and bends it upwards.

 

Hagrid: Dry up, Dursley, you great prune. {The gun fires}

All: Ahh!

Hagrid: {sees Dudley} Mind, I haven't seen you since you was a baby, Harry, but you're a bit more along than I would have expected. Particularly 'round the middle!

Dudley: I-I-I'm not Harry.

Harry appears: I-I am.

Hagrid: Oh, well, of course you are! Got something for ya. 'Fraid I might have sat on it at some point! I imagine that it'll taste fine just the same. Ahh. Baked it myself. {Hands Harry the cake} Words and all. Heh.

Harry: Thank you! {Opens cake, which reads: Happee Birdae Harry.}

Hagrid: It's not every day that your young man turns eleven, now is it?

 

Hagrid sits down on the couch, takes out an umbrella and points it at the empty fire. Poof, poof! Two sparks fly out and the fire starts. The family gapes.

 

Harry: {puts cake down} Excuse me, who are you?

Hagrid: Rubeus Hagrid. Keeper of keys and grounds at Hogwarts. Course, you'll know all about Hogwarts.

Harry: Sorry, no.

Hagrid: No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where your mum and dad learned it all?

Harry: Learnt what?

Hagrid: You're a wizard, Harry.

Harry: I-I'm a what?

Harry: A wizard. And a thumping good one at that, I'd wager. Once you train up a little.

Harry: No, you've made a mistake. I can't be...a-a wizard. I mean, I'm just... Harry. Just Harry.

Hagrid: Well, Just Harry, did you ever make anything happen? Anything you couldn't explain when you were angry or scared? {Harry softens his expression} Ah.

Dudley: {whimpers}

 

Hagrid hands Harry the same letter that has been sent the past while. Harry opens it.

 

Harry: Dear, Mr. Potter. We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at Hogwarts' School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!

Vernon: Hell not be going! We swore when we took him in wed put an end to this rubbish!

Harry: You knew?? You knew all along and you never told me?

Petunia: Of course we knew. How could you not be? My perfect sister being who she was. Oh, my mother and father were so proud the day she got her letter. We have a witch in the family. Isn't it wonderful? I was the only one to see her for what she was. A freak! And then she met that Potter, and then she had you, and I knew you'd be just the same, just as strange, just as ... abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

Harry: Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash!

Hagrid: A car crash? A car crash kill James and Lily Potter?

Petunia: We had to tell him something.

Hagrid: It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

Vernon: He'll not be going!

Hagrid: Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's going to stop him, are you?

Harry: Muggle?

Hagrid: Non magic folk. This boy's had his name down ever since he was born! He's going to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world, and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts' has ever seen: Albus Dumbledore.

Vernon: I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!

Hagrid: {whips out umbrella and points it at Vernon} Never insult Albus Dumbledore in front of me.

 

Hagrid sees Dudley eating Harry's cake, and points the umbrella at his rear. A grey tail grows.

 

Dudley: Ahh!

All: Ahh! {family chases Dudley}

Harry: {laughs}

Hagrid: Oh, um, I'd appreciate if you didn't tell anyone at Hogwarts about that. Strictly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.

Harry: {Nods} Okay.

Hagrid: {checks a clock} Ooh, we're a bit behind schedule. Best be off. Unless you'd rather stay, of course. Hmm? {Leaves}

 

Harry grins, looks back, and grins again.

 

Scene:

Streets of London. Hagrid and Harry are walking.

Harry: All students must be equipped with...one standard size two pewter cauldron and may bring if they desire either an owl, a cat or a toad. Can we find all this in London?

Hagrid: If you know where to go.

 

They go to a corner store and enter, The Leaky Cauldron.

{Music and talking}

 

Barkeep Tom: Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

Hagrid: No thanks, Tom. I'm on official Hogwarts business today. Just helping young Harry here buy his school supplies.

Tom: Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter.

 

The pub goes silent. A man comes up and shakes Harrys hand.

 

Man: Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.

 

A witch comes up and shakes Harrys hand, as well.

 

Witch: Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter. I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.

 

A man in robes with a turban on his head appears. It is PROFESSOR QUIRRELL.

 

Quirrell: Harry P-potter. C-can't tell you how pleased I am to meet you.

Hagrid: Hello, Professor. I didn't see you there. Harry, this is Professor Quirrell. He'll be your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

Harry: Oh, nice to meet you. {Puts out hand. Quirrell refuses}

Quirrell: F-fearfully fascinating subject. N-not that you need it, e-eh, Potter? Heheh.

Hagrid: Yes, well, must be going now. Lots to buy. Heh.

Harry: Good-bye.

 

The two leave into a back room winery in front of a brick wall.

 

Hagrid: See, Harry, you're famous!

Harry: But why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there, how is it they know who I am?

Hagrid: I'm not exactly sure I'm the right person to tell you that, Harry. {Taps the brick wall clockwise with his umbrella. The blocks shift and open up to reveal a hidden, busy street.}

Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.  

 

Harry grins broadly as they step into the street and walk down it. An owl screeches.

 

Hagrid: Here's where you'll get your quills and ink, and over there all your bits and bobs for doing your wizardry.

 

Harry is amazed as they pass by shops and owls and bats. The camera pans on a broom store, where a group of boys are crowded around a shiny broom.

 

Boy: It's a world class racing broom. Look at it, its the new Nimbus 2000! It's the fastest model yet.

Harry: But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this? I haven't any money.

Hagrid: Well there's your money, Harry. Gringotts, the Wizard Bank. T'aint no place safer, 'cept perhaps Hogwarts.

 

Inside the bank, they walk down the shiny aisle, passing tiny creatures working.

 

Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly are those things?

Hagrid: They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come goblins but not the most friendly of beasts. Best stick close to me. {Harry sticks to him.} {Hagrid clears his throat as they approach a counter with a goblin in it.} Mr. Harry Potter wishes to make a withdrawal.

 

The goblin looks up.

 

Goblin: And does Mr. Harry Potter have his key?

Hagrid: Oh. Wait a minute. Got it here somewhere. Hah. Here's the little devil. Oh, and there's something else as well. Professor Dumbledore gave me this. It's about you-know-what in vault you-know-which. {Hands Goblin letter wrapped in string.}

Goblin: Very well.

 

Scene:

Racing down the depth caverns in a cartlike structure. The cart stops, a goblin, GRIPHOOK, clambers out.

 

Griphook: Vault 687. Lamp, please. {Hagrid hands him the lamp and he walks to the vault} Key please. {Hagrid hands him the key and he unlocks it}

 

The room is filled nearly top to bottom with coins. Harry is amazed.

 

Hagrid: Didn't think your mum and dad would leave you with nothing, now didja?

 

They continue on through the cavern.

 

Griphook: Vault 713.

Harry: What's in there, Hagrid?

Hagrid: Can't tell you, Harry. It's Hogwarts business. Very secret.

Griphook: Stand back. {Slides finger down the door. Clank. Clank. The vault opens to expose a small white stone package. Hagrid hurries in and scoops it up. The eerie light it was shining with disappears.}

 

Hagrid: Best not mention this to anyone, Harry.

Harry nods.

 

Scene: Outside in the street, walking.

 

Harry: I still need...a wand.

Hagrid: A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders. No place better. Run along there, but wait. I just got one more thing I got to do. Won't be long.

 

Harry goes into the store, quietly. He looks around. There are shelves of wands, but no people.

 

Harry: {Softly} Hello? Hello?

 

There is a thunk. A man appears on a ladder and looks at Harry. He smiles.

 

Ollivander: I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. It seems only yesterday that your mother and father were in here buying their first wands. {Picks a wand} Ah. Here we are. {Harry holds it but just stands} Well, give it a wave.

Harry: Oh! {waves. All the shelves come crashing down. Harry jumps and hurriedly puts the wand back on the counter.}

Ollivander: Apparently not. {Gets another wand.} Perhaps this. {Harry waves at a vase, which blows apart.} No, no, definitely not! No matter...{gets a wand} I wonder. {Hands wand to Harry. Harry glows under it.} Curious, very curious.

Harry: Sorry, but what's curious?

Ollivander: I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It just so happens that the phoenix, whose tail feather resides in your wand gave one other feather, just one. It is curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother gave you that scar. {Points to scar}

Harry: And...who owned that wand?

Ollivander: Oh, we do not speak his name. The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear why, but I think it is clear that we can expect great things from you. After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things...terrible, yes, but great. {Hands Harry his wand.}

 

There is a knock on the window.

 

Hagrid: Harry! Harry! Happy birthday! {Has a snowy owl in a cage which hoots.}

Harry: Wow.

 

Scene: Later, eating supper. The two, Hagrid and Harry, are at a long table, eating soup.

 

Hagrid: You all right, Harry? You seem very quiet.

Harry: He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this. You know, Hagrid, I know you do.

Hagrid: {Sighs and pushes bowl away} First, and understand this, Harry, 'cause it's very important. Not all wizards are good. Some of them go bad. A few years ago there was one wizard who went as bad as you can go. And his name was V-...his name was V-...

Harry: Maybe if you wrote it down?

Hagrid: No, I can't spell it. All right. His name was Voldemort.

Harry: Voldemort?

Hagrid: Shh!!

{Harry looks around}

 

A flashback ensues, consisting off a cloaked man walking towards a house, breaking in with his wand, and proceeding to terrorize. Hagrid narrates.

 

Hagrid: It was dark times, Harry, dark times. Voldemort started to gather some followers, brought 'em over to the dark side. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Your parents fought against him, but nobody lived once he decided to kill 'em. {Harrys mother, LILY, screams as she is killed by Voldemorts wand} Nobody...not one. Except you. {close-up of baby Harry.}

Harry: Me? Voldemort tried to kill...me?

Hagrid: Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut on your forehead, Harry. A mark like that only comes from being touched by a curse...and an evil curse at that.

Harry: What happened to Vo-...to You-Know-Who?

Hagrid: Some say he died. Codswallop in my opinion. Nope, I reckon he's out there, still, too tired to go on. But one thing's absolutely certain. Something about you stumped him that night. That's why you're famous, Harry. That's why everbody knows your name. You're the boy who lived.

 

  

Scene: London Train Station. Up on a crossing bridge, Harry (with cart and owl) walk beside Hagrid.

 

A couple look at Hagrid.

 

Hagrid: What're you looking at? {Looks at watch} Blimey, is that the time?? Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you. Dumbledore'll be wanting his...well, he'll be wanting to see me. Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes. Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

 

Harry looks at his golden ticket.

 

Harry: Platform 9 ¾? But Hagrid, there must be a mistake. This says Platform 9 ¾. There's no such thing...is there? {Harry looks up and Hagrid has vanished.}

 

Scene: Harry is walking down lane between trains. A man rushes by.

 

Man: Sorry.

Harry sees a train master.

Harry: Excuse me, excuse me.

Trainmaster: {talking to woman and child} Right on your left, ma'am.

Harry: Excuse me, Sir. Can you tell me where I might find Platform 9 ¾?

Trainmaster: 9 ¾? Think youre being funny, do ya? {Leaves}

 

A woman, daughter, and four boys walk by, pushing carts.

 

Mrs. Weasley: It's the same year after year. Always packed with Muggles, of course.

Harry: Muggles?

Mrs. Weasley: Come on. Platform 9 ¾ this way! All right, Percy, you first.

 

A tall boy with red hair comes forward and runs towards a brick wall. Amazingly, he disappears right into it. Harry is amazed.

 

Mrs. Weasley: Fred, you next.

George: He's not Fred, I am!

Fred: Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother!

Mrs. Weasley: Oh, I'm sorry, George.

Fred: I'm only joking. I am Fred. {He runs through the wall, and is followed by his twin brother.}

 

Harry shakes his head in disbelief.

 

Harry: Excuse me! C-could you tell me how to

Mrs. Weasley: How to get on the platform? Yes, not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time to Hogwarts as well. {pan to a red haired boy who smiles} Now, all you've got to do is walk straight at the wall between platforms 9 and 10. Best do it at a bit of a run if youre nervous.

Ginny (daughter): Good luck.

 

Harry takes a breath and runs at the wall. He shuts his eyes and emerges on the other side a magnificent station with a red train and bundles of people. A whistle blows, and Harry sighs with relief.

 

Scene: The train is traveling through unknown country. Pan to inside compartment, where Harry is sitting. The red headed boy, RON, appears, dirt on his nose.

 

Ron: Excuse me, do you mind? Everywhere else is full.

Harry: No, not at all.

Ron: {sits across from Harry} I'm Ron, by the way. Ron Weasley.

Harry: I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

{Ron goes agape.}

Ron: So-so it's true?! I mean, do you really have the...the...

Harry: The what?

Ron: {whispers} Scar...?

Harry: Oh, yeah. {lifts up hair}

Ron: Wicked.

A trolley comes by the compartment, full of sweets.

Woman: Anything off the trolley, dears?

Ron: {Holds up mushed sandwiches} No, thanks, I'm all set. {smacks lips.}

Harry: {pulls out coins} We'll take the lot!

Ron: Whoa!

 

Scene: Eating bundles of sweets.

Ron's rat, Scabbers, is perched on Ron's knee, a box over its head.

 

Harry: Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans?

Ron: They mean every flavour! There's chocolate and peppermint, and there's also spinach, liver and tripe. George sweared he got a bogey-flavoured one once!

 

Harry quickly takes the bean he was chewing out of his mouth.

 

Harry: {picks up blue and gold package} These aren't real chocolate frogs, are they?

Ron: It's only a spell. Besides, it's the cards you want. Each pack's got a famous witch or wizard. I got about 500 meself.

Frog: Ribbit. {The frog jumps onto the window and climbs up, then leaps out the window...disappearing.}

Ron: Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only got one good jump in them to begin with.

Harry: Hey, I got Dumbledore!

Ron: I got about 6 of him.

Harry: Hey, he's gone!

Ron: Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? {Scabbers squeaks} This is Scabbers, by the way, pitiful, isn't he?

Harry: Just a little bit.

Ron: Fred gave me a spell as to turn him yellow. Want to see?

Harry: Yeah!

Ron: {clears throat} Ahem. Sun-

 

A girl, HERMIONE GRANGER, with bushy brown hair appears at the doorway.

 

Hermione: Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville's lost one.

Ron: No.

Hermione: Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then.

Ron: Aghhhemm. Sunshine, daises, butter mellow, turn this stupid fat rat yellow!

{Zap. Nothing happens. Ron shrugs.}

Hermione: Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? Of course I've only tried a few simple spells myself, and they've all worked for me. For example...{Hermione goes over and sits across from Harry. He points her hand at his glasses and Harry tenses} Oculus Reparo. {The glasses, which noseband is battered, are repaired. Harry takes them off, amazed.} That's better, isn't it? Holy Cricket, you're Harry Potter. I'm Hermione Granger...and you are...?

Ron: {full mouth} I'm...Ron Weasley.

Hermione: Pleasure. You two better change into your robes. I expect we'll be arriving soon. {Gets up and leaves, then comes back and looks at Ron.} You've got dirt, on your nose, by the way, did you know? Just there. {Points} {Ron scratches his nose, embarrassed.}

 

Scene: Darkness, the train blows its whistle and pulls into an outdoor station. Hagrid walks along the side aisle, with a lantern. People begin pouring out of the train.

 

Hagrid: Right, then! First years! This way, please! Come on, now, don't be shy! Come on now, hurry up!

 

Harry and Ron walk up to Hagrid.

 

Hagrid: Hello, Harry.

Harry: Hey, Hagrid.

Ron: Whoaa!

Hagrid: Right then. This way to the boats! Come on, now, follow me.

 

Scene:

A number of boats are plugging across a vast lake, where up ahead a huge castle can be seen. People are in awe.

Ron: Wicked.

 

Scene: On a higher level, Professor McGonagall is waiting. She raps her fingers on a stone railing, and then goes to the top of the stairs to greet the newcomers.

 

McGonagall: Welcome to Hogwarts. Now, in a few moments, you will pass through these doors and join your classmates. But before you can take your seats you must be sorted into your houses. They are Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, and Slytherin. Now, while you are here, your house will be like your family. Your triumphs will earn you house points. Any rule breaking, and you will lose points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup

 

NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, a scared looking boy, spots his toad sitting near McGonagall. He jumps forward.

 

Neville: Trevor! {McGonagall stares down at him} Sorry. {He backs away.}

McGonagall: The sorting ceremony will begin momentarily. {leaves}

 

DRACO MALFOY, a slicked back evil looking boy speaks up.

 

Draco: It's true then, what they're saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts. {Students whisper, Harry Potter?} This is Crabbe, and Goyle {nods to thugs} and I'm Malfoy...Draco Malfoy. {Ron snickers at his name} Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, and a hand me down robe? You must be a Weasley. Well soon find that some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. Dont want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there. {extends hand.}

Harry: I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks.

 

Draco glares. McGonagall returns and smacks him on the shoulder with a paper. He retreats with one last glare.

 

McGonagall: We're ready for you now.

 

She leads everyone through two large doors and into the Great Hall, where there are four long tables with many kids, as well as floating candles. The roof appears to be the sky.

 

Hermione: It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched to look like the night sky. I read about it in Hogwarts: A History.

McGonagall: All right, will you wait along here, please? Now, before we begin, Professor Dumbldedore would like to say a few words.

 

Dumbledore rises from the main table.

 

Dumbledore: I have a few start of term notices I wish to announce. The first years please note that the dark forest is strictly forbidden to all students. Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch {signals to ragged old man with a cat with red eyes} has asked me to remind you that the 3rd floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a most painful death. Thank you.

McGonagall: When I call your name, you will come forth, I shall place the sorting hat on your head, and you will be sorted into your houses. Hermione Granger.

Hermione: Oh, no. Okay, relax. {She goes up}

Ron: Mental that one, I'm telling you.

Harry nods in agreement.

Sorting Hat: Ah, right then...hmm...right. Okay...Gryffindor!!

(Cheering)

 

Hermione jumps off with a smile.

 

McGonagall: Draco Malfoy.

 

Draco saunters up proudly. The tattered hat nearly freaks before touching down on Dracos head.

 

Sorting Hat: SLYTHERIN!

 

Ron: There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad who wasnt in Slytherin.

McGonagall: Susan Bones.

 

A small, redhead goes up.

Harry looks around and spots a black haired, pale teacher, SEVERUS SNAPE, looking at him. His scar hurts.

 

Harry: Ahh! {puts hand on forehead}

Ron: Harry, what is it?

Harry: Nothing...it's nothing, I'm fine.

 

Sorting Hat: Let's see...I know...Hufflepuff!

McGonagall: Ronald Weasley.

 

Ron gulps and walks up. He sits down and the hat is put on.

 

Sorting Hat: Ah! Another Weasley. I know just where to put you...Gryffindor!!

Ron: {Sighs}

(Cheering)

 

McGonagall: Harry Potter.

 

Everything goes silent. Harry walks up and sits down.

 

Sorting Hat: Hmm...difficult, very difficult. Plenty of courage I see, not a bad mind, either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you?

Harry: {whispers} Not Slytherin. Not Slytherin.

Sorting Hat: Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you know. Its all here in your head. And Slytherin will help you on your way to greatness! There's no doubt about that! No? {Harry whispers: Not Slytherin...anything but Slytherin} Well, if youre sure...better be...GRYFFINDOR!!

 

There is an immense cheering and Harry goes to the Gryffindor table.

Fred and George are also there, and cheer: We got Potter! We got Potter! Harry sits down.

 

McGonagall: {dings on a cup} Your attention, please.

Dumbledore: Let the feast...begin.

 

Food magically appears on all the tables, and the hall is filled with awe and chatter.

 

Harry: Wow.

 

Draco looks at all the food, raises his eyebrows and digs in.

Ron stuffs his face.

 

SEAMUS FINNIGAN, a tiny boy, speaks.

 

Seamus: I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle. Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for him when he found out.

Neville laughs.

 

Harry is sitting next to Percy. He leans over.

 

Harry: Say, Percy, who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?

Percy: Oh, that's Professor Snape, head of Slytherin house.

Harry: What's he teach?

Percy: Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. He's been after Quirrells job for years.

 

Ron, having just finished a chicken wing, reaches into the bowl for more, and a ghostly head, SIR NICHOLAS, pops out.

 

Ron: Ahh!

Nick: Hello! How are you? Welcome to Gryffindor.

 

Numerous ghosts come pouring from the walls, sailing along.

 

Hufflepuff ghost: Whoo-hoo-hoo!

Girl: Look, its the Bloody Baron!

Percy: Hello, Sir Nicholas. Have a nice summer?

Nick: Dismal. Once again, my request to join the headless hunt has been denied. {Begins to leave}

Ron: Hey, I know you! You're Nearly Headless Nick!

Nick: I prefer Sir Nicholas if you don't mind.

Hermione: Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless?

Nick: Like this. {Grabs head and pulls it to the side. His head is hanging on just by a thread.}

Ron: Ahh!

Hermione: Eugh.

 

Scene:

Percy is leading the Gryffindors to the staircases.

 

Percy: Gryffindors, follow me please. Keep up. Thank you.

Boy: Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

Percy: This is the most direct path to the dormitories. Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases...they like to change.

 

The camera pans up and we see a vast amount of staircases, people walking on them, and some switching places.

 

Percy: Keep up, please, and follow me. Quickly now, come on. Come on. {They begin walking up the stairs}

Neville: Seamus, that picture's moving!

Ron: Look at that one, Harry!

Harry: I think she fancies you.

Girl: Oh, look! Look! Who's that girl?

Man in painting: Welcome to Hogwarts.

Girl: Who's that?

 

Scene:

Approaching the Gryffindor dorms. They come up to a large painting of a large woman in a pink dress.

 

Woman: Password?
Percy: Caput Draconis. {The woman nods and the painting opens to reveal a gape in the wall.} Follow me, everyone. Keep up, quickly, come on.

Girl: Oh, wow.

Percy: {Inside common room} Gather 'round here. Welcome to the Gryffindor Common Room. Boys' dormitories, upstairs and down to your left. Girls, the same on your right. You'll find that your belongings have already been brought up.

 

Scene: Mid-night. Harry is sitting by a window in his pj's, with his owl, Hedwig. He pets the owl and looks out the window, sighing with content.

 

 

Scene: Morning. Harry and Ron are running through the stone halls to their class. They rush in. In the class, a tabby cat is sitting on a desk.

 

Ron: Whew, amazing, can you imagine the look on old McGonagall's face if we were late?

 

The cat jumps off the desk and turns into Professor McGonagall. The two boys are amazed.

 

Ron: That was bloody brilliant.

McGonagall: Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. Maybe if I were to transfigure Mr. Potter and yourself into a pocketwatch, maybe one of you would be on time.

Harry: We got lost.

McGonagall: Then perhaps a map? I trust you don't need one to find your seats.

 

Scene: Snape's potions class. The students are chattering, sitting near steaming cauldrons. The door slams open and Snape comes rushing in.

 

Snape: There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to enjoy the subtle science and exact art that is potion making. However, for those select few {looks at Draco, who smiles}, who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory and even put a stopper {Draco looks on} in death. {Draco raises his eyebrows.} {Snape sees Harry, writing this down, in, his view, not paying attention.} Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confidant enough to not...pay...attention.

 

Hermione nudges Harry in the ribs. He looks up.

 

Snape: Mr. Potter. Our...new...celebrity. Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood? {Hermione's hand skyrockets. Harry shrugs.} You don't know? Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I asked you to find me a bezoar? {Hermione's hand shoots up again.}

Harry: I don't know, Sir.

Snape: And what is the difference between Monkshood and Wolfbane?

Harry: I don't know, Sir.

Snape: Pity. Clearly, fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter?

 

Scene: In the great hall, probably midday. The students are all working on homework.

 

Seamus is trying a spell on a cup.

 

Seamus: Eye of rabbit, harp string hum. Turn this water, into rum. {Looks in cup and shakes head.} Eye of rabbit, harp string hum...

Harry: What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water?

Ron: Turn it into rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday, before...

 

ZAPOOF! The cup explodes. There is laughter amongst the students. Suddenly, a flock of owls start coming into the hall from the rafters above.

 

Ron: Ah. Mail's here!

 

The owls soar by, dropping parcels to students. Harry gets nothing. He sees the newspaper Ron has put down.

 

Harry: Can I borrow this? {Ron nods} Thanks.

 

Neville is unwrapping a gift. It is a clear ball with gold around it.

 

Seamus: Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall!

Hermione: I've read about those. When the smoke turns red {the smoke turns red}, it means you've forgotten something.

Neville: The only problem is, I can't remember what I've forgotten.

Harry: Hey, Ron, somebody broke into Gringotts. Listen, Believed to be the work of dark witches or wizards unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowledging the breach, insist that nothing was taken. The vault in question, number 713, had in fact been emptied earlier that same day. That's odd. That's the vault Hagrid and I went to.

 

Scene: Outside, flying practice. The students, Gryffindor and Slytherin, are lined up in two rows with brooms by their sides. The teacher, MADAM HOOCH, comes down the line. She has short hair and hawk yellow eyes.

 

Hooch: Good afternoon, class.

Class: Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

Hooch: Good afternoon, Amanda, good afternoon. {to class} Welcome to your first flying lesson. Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step up to the left side of their broomstick. Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand over the broom and say, Up!

Class: Up!

 

Harry's broom flies into his hand.

 

Harry: Whoa. {Hermione stares as the class continues.}

Draco: Up! {broomstick flies up and Draco smugly grins.}

Hooch: With feeling!

Hermione: Up. Up. Up. Up.

Ron: Up!! {His broom flies up and conks him on the nose} Ow! {Harry laughs} Shut up, Harry. {laughs}

Hooch: Now, once you've got hold of your broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight, you don't want to be sliding off the end. {Class mounts} When I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground, hard. Keep your broom steady, hover for a moment, and then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On my whistle...3...2...{tweet!}

 

Neville immediately lifts off. He looks quite frightened.

 

Neville: Oh...

Hooch: Mr. Longbottom.

Girl: Neville, what are you doing?

Students: Neville...Neville...

Boy: We're not supposed to take off, yet.

Hooch: {Neville begins soaring away} M-M-Mr. Longbottom Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: AHH!
Hooch: Mr. Longbottom!

Neville: {soars away} Down! Down! Ahhhh!

Harry: Neville! {shouting}

Neville: Help!!!

Hooch: Come back down this instant!

Neville: AHH!

 

He soars through the sky and hits a wall, conking along it and then swooping off. All the while, he is screaming. He begins to zoom back towards the group of students. Hooch holds out her wand to stop him.

 

Neville: Help!

Hooch: Mr. Longbottom! {Neville approaches. The students scatter and Hooch dives out of the way. Neville goes through the scatter and up a tower.}

Neville: Ahhhh! Whoa! Ahhh! {zooms past a statue of a man with a sharp spear. Neville's cloak catches on it. He is flipped off the broom and hangs there.} Oh. Ah...help! {He wavers, then the cloak rips, and he falls, catching on a torch, but then slipping out and falling to the ground.} Ahh!

Hooch: Everyone out of the way! {She runs through the group, and they scatter.} Come on, get up.

Girl: Is he alright?

Neville: Owowowow.

Hooch: Oh, oh, oh, oh dear. It's a broken wrist. Tch, tch, tch. Good boy, come on now, up you get. {Draco reaches down and grabs Neville's Remembrall, which has fallen. Hooch begins to lead Neville away with her.} Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the hospital wing. Understand? If I see a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch. {Exit.}

Draco: {snickers} Did you see his face? Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze, he'd have remembered to fall on his fat ass. {Laughs.}

Harry: Give it here, Malfoy.

Draco: No. I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. {hops on broom and soars around group, then through.} How 'bout up on the roof?? {soars off and hovers high in the sky.} What's the matter, Potter? Bit beyond your reach?

 

Harry grabs his broom and runs to get on it. Hermione stops him.

 

Hermione: Harry, no! You heard what Madam Hooch said! Besides, you don't even know how to fly. {Harry flies off.} What an idiot.

 

Harry is now in the air, across from Draco.

 

Harry: Give it here, Malfoy, or I'll knock you off your broom!

Draco: Is that so? {Harry makes a dash for him, but Draco twirls around his broom in a 360.} Have it your way, then! {He throws the Remembrall into the air.}

 

Harry zooms after the ball, speeding towards a tower. Just as he is about to hit a window, from which McGonagall is working/watching, he catches it, and then heads back to the group. The students all cheer and run to see him.

 

Boy: Good job, Harry!

Boy 2: Oh, that was wicked, Harry.

McGonagall: {appears quickly} Harry Potter? Follow me. {Harry sullenly follows her. Draco and his goons laugh.}

 

Scene: Professor Quirrells classroom. He is inside, teaching, holding an iguana.

 

Quirrell: An iguana s-such as this is {McGonagall approaches the class and stops Harry: You wait here.} an essential in-gredient

McGonagall: Excuse me, excuse me, Professor Quirrell. Could I borrow Wood for a moment?

Quirrell: Oh. Y-yes, of course. {a boy, OLIVER WOOD, gets up to leave and Quirrell continues.} And the vampire b-bat...{eerie roar.}

McGonagall: Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood, I have found you a Seeker!

 

Scene: Harry and Ron are walking through crowded halls. Sir Nicholas and a lady ghost float by.

 

Nick: Have you heard? Harry Potter's the new Gryffindor Seeker. I always knew hed do well.

Ron: Seeker? But first years never make their house teams! You must be the youngest Quidditch player in

Harry: A century, according to McGonagall.

 

Fred and George approach and walk along with Ron and Harry.

 

Fred: Hey, well done, Harry, Wood's just told us!

Ron: Fred and George are on the team, too. Beaters.

George: Our job is to make sure that you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch.

Fred: Brutal. But no one's died in years. Someone will vanish occasionally... {They break off from Harry and Ron, who walk across a courtyard.  

George: But they'll turn up in a month or two!!

Ron: Oh, go on, Harry, Quidditch is great. Best game there is! And you'll be great, too! {Hermione jumps up from her work and comes to join them.}

Harry: But I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself?

Hermione: You won't make a fool of yourself. It's in your blood.

 

Scene: The three approach a trophy case. Hermione points at a plaque of Quidditch players. One lists Harry's father as a Seeker.

 

Ron: Whoa. Harry, you never told me your father was a Seeker, too.

Harry: I-I didn't know.

 

 

Scene: The three are walking up a staircase. A railing pulls in...Hermione looks, but continues walking.

 

Ron: I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do.

Harry: Who doesn't?

 

The staircase shudders and begins to move. The three grab the railings.

 

Ron: Ahh!

Hermione: {Gasps.}

Harry: What's happening?

Hermione: The staircases change, remember? {The staircase stops, in a new place.}

Harry: {taps Ron} Let's go this way.

Ron: Before the staircase moves again. {They all open a door and walk into a spooky, dark room.}

Harry: Does anyone feel like...we shouldn't be here?

Hermione: We're not supposed to be here. This is the 3rd floor. It's forbidden.

 

Suddenly, a flame lights on a tall stone support. At that moment, the caretaker's cat, MRS. NORRIS, comes running in and meows. The group jumps.

 

Harry: Let's go.

{meow}

Ron: It's Filch's cat!

Harry: Run!

 

The group runs. Flames are lit as they go. They get to the end of the corridor, to a door. Harry grabs the handle, but it's locked.

 

Harry: It's locked!

Ron: That's it, we're done for!

Hermione: Oh, move over! {pushes through and pulls out wand} Alohomora. {The door opens.} Get in. {They bustle in.}

Ron: Alohomora?

Hermione: Standard book of spells, Chapter 7.

 

Filch appears at the start of the corridor with a light. Mrs. Norris looks at him.

 

Filch: Anyone here, my sweet? {meow} Come on. {exit.}

Hermione: Filch is gone.

Ron: Probably thinks this door's locked.

Hermione: It was locked.

Harry: And for good reason. {Ron and Hermione turn to stand with Harry. There is a massively huge three headed dog sleeping in front of them. The dog, FLUFFY, begins to wake. It growls, yawns, and growls more...noticing the intruders.}

All: AHHHHHHH! {The three bolt, running out of the door. They turn quickly to shut the door and battle against the dog. They get the door shut and run.}

 

Scene:

Back in the Gryffindor room. They are breathless.

 

Ron: What do they think they're doing?? Keeping a thing like that locked up in a school.

Hermione: You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on?

Ron: I wasn't looking at its feet! I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe you didn't notice, there were three! {they begin to climb the stairs to the dorms.}

Hermione: It was standing on a trap door. Which means it wasn't there by accident. It's guarding something.

Harry: Guarding something?

Hermione: That's right. Now, if you two don't mind, I'm going to bed before either of you come up with another clever idea to get us killed...or worse, expelled! {turns and leaves, shutting the door to her dorms.}

Ron: She needs to sort out her priorities!

Harry nods.

 

Scene: Outside, day time. Oliver and Harry appear, carrying a trunk. They put it down.

 

Oliver: Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each time has seven players, 3 chasers, 2 beaters, 1 keeper and a seeker that's you. There are three kinds of balls. {picks up a red one} This one's called the Quaffle. Now, the chasers handle the Quaffle and try to put it through one of those three hoops. {Points to a faraway Quidditch pitch.} The keeper, that's me, defends the hoops. {throws ball to Harry.} With me so far?

Harry: {throws back} I think so. What are those? {points to two squirming chained down balls.}

Oliver: ...You better take this. {hands Harry a small bat. He bends down and releases one ball. With an angry growl, it flies off into the air. The two boys watch it.} Careful now, it's comin' back. {The balls comes whizzing down, and Harry cracks at it with the bat. The ball soars off through a statue.} Eh, not bad, Potter, you'd make a fair beater...Uh-oh. {The ball zooms down, and Oliver grabs it, wriggling to get it back in the box. He succeeds and is out of breath.} Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But the only ball I want you to worry about is this...the Golden Snitch. {hands Harry a walnut sized golden ball.}

Harry: I like this ball.

Oliver: Ah, you like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see.

Harry: What do I do with it?

Oliver: You catch it...before the other team's seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You catch this, Potter, and we win.

{The ball flutters out two delicate wings and jumps into the air. Harry keeps an eye on it.}

Harry: Whoa.

 

Scene: PROFESSOR FLITWICK's class. The teacher is very short, and is standing on a bunch of books.

 

Flitwick: One of a wizard's most rudimentary skills is levitation the ability to make objects fly. Uh, do you all have your feathers? {Hermione raises hers.} Good. Now, uh, don't forget the nice wrist movement we've been practicing, hmm? The swish and flick. Everyone. {All} The swish and flick. Good. And enunciate. Wingardium Leviosa. Off you go then.

Draco: Wingardium Levio-saaa.

{All practice.}

Ron: Wingardrium Leviosar. {whacks with wand numerous times.}

Hermione: Stop, stop, stop. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, youre saying it wrong. It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

Ron: You do it then if you're so clever. Go on, go on.

 

Hermione straightens up and swishes her wand.

 

Hermione: {crisply} Wingardium Leviosa. {The feather glows and lifts up. Ron puts his head on his books dejectedly.}

Flitwick: Oh, well done! See here, everyone! Ms. Granger's done it! Oh, splendid!

 

Seamus begins swishing at his feather.

 

Seamus: Wingard Levosa. Wingard Levosa. {Flitwick to Hermione: Well done, dear.}

 

BOOOM!!! Seamus' feather explodes. Flitwick gasps.

 

Flitwick: Whooaaa! Ooh.

Harry: I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor.

 

Scene: Neville, Harry, Ron and Seamus are walking through a courtyard with other students all around.

 

Ron: It's Leviosa, not Leviosar. Honestly, she's a nightmare. No wonder she hasn't got any friends!

 

Hermione bustles past, sniffling.

 

Harry: I think she heard you.

 

Scene: Night, in the great hall. It is Halloween. Everyone is eating candy, and Jack O'Lanterns are keeping the place lit. There is chatter.

 

Harry: Where's Hermione?

Neville: Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't come out of the girl's bathroom. She said that she'd been in there all afternoon...crying.

{Ron and Harry exchange glances. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell comes flying into the room, screaming.}

Quirrell: TROLL! IN THE DUNGEON! T-TROOLLL IN THE DUNGEON!! {stops and there is utter silence.} Thought you ought to know. {falls over in a dead faint.}

 

The room is silent, and then everyone freaks, screaming and running.

 

Dumbledore: SILLLLLEEENNNNCEEEEE! {Everyone stops.} Everyone will please, not panic. Now, Prefects will lead their houses back to the dormitories. Teachers will follow me to the dungeons.

Girl: Hufflepuff, this way!

Boy: Stay together!

 

Snape looks aghast, and he disappears through a doorway.

 

Scene: Percy is leading the house down a hall.

 

Percy: Gryffindors...keep up please. And stay alert!

Harry: How could a troll get in?

Ron: Not by itself. Trolls are really stupid. Probably people playing jokes. {Suddenly, Harry stops and pulls Ron aside.} What?

Harry: Hermione! She doesn't know!

 

The two run off, down corridors. They start running down a hall when they stop, because there is a grunting noise. Harry pulls Ron into a doorway and a large, ugly TROLL thunks by into a room.

 

Harry: He's going into the Girl's Bathroom!

 

Scene: In the bathroom, Hermione emerges from a stall, wiping her eyes. She stops when she sees something. The troll is standing there. Hermione backs up, into the stall just as the troll raises its club and smashes the top part of the stalls. Hermione screams. Harry and Ron come bursting in.

 

Harry: Hermione, move!

 

The troll smashes the remaining stalls.

 

Hermione: Help! Help! {The boys start throwing wood pieces at the troll.}

Ron: Hey, pea brain! {Ron throws wood and hits the troll on the head. Hermione escapes from the stalls to under a sink, but the troll sees her and goes to smash her. It cracks the sink and barely misses Hermione. Harry cringes.}

Hermione: Ahhh! Help!

 

Harry gets out his wand. He runs forward and grabs the troll's club, and is lifted up.

 

Harry: Whooa! Whoa, whoa! {He lands on the troll's head, and is hurled forward, then back, and his wand goes up the troll's nose.}

Ron: Ew.

 

The troll snorts, and whips around.

 

Harry: Whoa, whoa whoa!

 

The troll gets Harry off its head and is holding him by one leg, upside down. It gears up its club and swipes at Harry. He pulls himself up, then down. The troll swipes again.

 

Harry: Do something! {swipe}

Ron: What? {swipe}

Harry: Anything! Hurry up!

 

Ron grabs his wand. Under the sink, Hermione waves her hand.

 

Hermione: Swish and flick!

Ron: Wingardium Leviosa! {flick. The club is lifted out of the troll's hand and hovers above its head. The troll looks up, confused, just as the club comes crashing back down. (Ron: Cool.)  It hits the troll's head and the troll wavers, then drops Harry, who crawls away, and comes crashing down, hard.

 

Hermione approaches carefully.

 

Hermione: Is it...dead?

Harry: I don't think so. Just knocked out. {He grabs his wand...which is covered in goo.} Ew. Troll bogies.

 

Suddenly, McGonagall, Snape and Quirrell come rushing in.

They all gasp.

 

McGonagall: Oh! Oh, my goodness! E-Explain yourselves, both of you!

Ron and Harry: Well, what it is...

Hermione: It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. {The teachers, and Ron and Harry, gape}

McGonagall: Ms. Granger?

Hermione: I went looking for the troll. I'd read about them and thought I could handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come and found me...I'd probably be dead.

McGonagall: Be that as it may...it was an extremely foolish thing to do. {Harry looks at Snape's leg...which has a large cut on it. Snape notices and covers it up, glaring at Harry.} I would have expected more rational behaviour on your part, Ms. Granger. 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor for your serious lack of judgment. As for you two gentlemen I just hope you realize how fortunate you are. Not many students could take on a full grown mountain troll and live to tell the tale. 5 points...will be awarded to each of you. For sheer dumb luck. {Snape and McGonagall exit.}

Quirrell: Perhaps you ought to go...M-might wake up...heh. {Exit Ron and Harry and Hermione.} {Troll roars.} Ahh! Hehe....

 

Scene: The next morning, in the great hall. The gang is sitting, eating. Harry is twirling his food on a fork.

 

Ron: Take a bit of toast, mate, go on.

Hermione: Ron's right, Harry. You're gonna need your strength today.

Harry: I'm not hungry.

 

Snape appears.

 

Snape: Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you...even if it is against Slytherin. {Leaves, limping.}

Harry: That explains the blood.

Hermione: Blood?

Harry: Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let the troll in as a diversion so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog. But, he got himself bitten, that's why he's limping.

Hermione: But why would anyone go near that dog?

Harry: The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the vaults. He said it was Hogwarts' business, very secret.

Hermione: So you're saying...

Harry: That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants.

{An owl screeches. It is Hedwig. She is carrying a very large, long parcel. She drops it off.}

Hermione: Bit early for mail, isn't it?

Harry: But I-I never get mail.

Ron: Let's open it.

{They open it.}

Harry: It's a broomstick!
Ron: Thats not just any broomstick, Harry. It's a Nimbus 2000!

Harry: But who...?

{He sees Professor McGonagall up at the head table, stroking Hedwig. She smiles and Harry nods.}

 

Scene: Inside a Quidditch tower. The Gryffindor team is marching towards the starting gate. They reach it and stop, behind a closed double door.

 

OIiver: Scared, Harry?

Harry: A little bit.

Oliver: That's all right. I felt the same way before my first game.

Harry: What happened?
Oliver: Er, I don't really remember. I took a bludger to the head 2 minutes in. Woke up in the hospital a week later.

 

Harry gulps and looks straight ahead as the doors open. They mount their brooms and zoom out onto the enormous pitch. There is cheering. The commentator, LEE JORDAN, is talking from a tower.

 

Lee: Hello, and welcome to Hogwarts' first Quidditch game of the season! Today's game Slytherin versus Gryffindor!!!

 

{Cheering. Close-up of Gryffindor students. They are cheering. Neville: Gryffindor!}

 

The players take their positions in the air in a circle. Harry weaves in, highest amongst. He looks down.

 

Lee: The players take their positions as Madam Hooch steps out onto the field to begin the game.

Hooch: Now, I want a nice clean game...from all of you. {looks at Slytherin. She kicks the trunk, and the bludgers zoom out.}

Lee: The bludgers are up...followed by the Golden Snitch. Remember, the snitch is worth 150 points. The seeker who catches the Snitch ends the game.

 

The snitch zooms around each Seeker's head, then disappears. Hooch grabs the Quaffle.

 

Lee: The Quaffle is released...and the game begins!

 

Gryffindor takes possession of the ball and a chaser, ANGELINA JOHNSON, zooms past Slytherins towards their goal, and throws the ball, and scores! There is a ding.

 

Lee: Angelina Johnson scores! 10 points for Gryffindor! {He presses a button and a 10 shows up beside a plaque with Gryffindors name.}

 

Harry, in the air, claps.

 

Harry: Yes! {a bludger zooms by him.} Whoa!

 

In the stands, Gryffindor cheers.

 

Hagrid: Well done!

Lee: Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle. Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

 

Flint dodges people and throws for the Gryffindor hoops. Oliver appears and whacks the ball away with his broom. He smirks at Flint, who glares. Johnson and KATIE BELL pass the Quaffle back and forth as they strategize to score. Johnson takes it, throws, and once again scores!

 

Ron and Seamus: Yay!

Harry: Yes!

Lee: Another 10 points to Gryffindor! {ding.}

Gryffindors: Yay!

 

The Slytherins decide to get messy. They dodge, kick, and try to score. Once again, Oliver blocks.

 

Flint: Give me that! {he grabs a beaters bat from one and whacks a bludger right at Oliver. It hits Oliver in the stomach and he falls to the ground.}

 

Crowd: {Booing}

Harry is visibly upset.

Slytherin laughs.

 

The Slytherin members head off. One jumps over George (or Fred) and scores. Harry is upset again. Slytherin cheers.

 

Flint: {to other members} Take that side!

 

They box Johnson in and sent her into the capes covering one of the towers. She falls down in and is out. The crowd boos. Slytherin scores once again. Suddenly, Harry sees the Snitch. He starts to head off after it and then his broom starts bucking and turning.

 

Harry: Whoa! Whooa!

Hagrid: What's going on with Harry's broomstick?

 

Hermione looks through binoculars at Harry, then at Snape, who is muttering something.

 

Hermione: It's Snape! He's jinxing the broom!

Ron: Jinxing the broom? What do we do?

Hermione: Leave it to me. {She hands Ron her binoculars and leaves.}

 

Harry is knocked around, then falls, dangling by one arm from the broom.

 

Ron: Come on, Hermione!

 

Hermione is hurrying up a tower. She appears underneath Snape and touches his cloak with her wand.

 

Hermione: Lacarnum Inflamarae.

 

A spark ignites and Snape's cloak catches fire. Hermione leaves.

 

Man: Fire! You're on fire!

Snape: What? Oh! {knocks the man back, who falls into Quirrell, who then also falls. Snape bats out the fire and acts as though nothing happened. The broom stop bucking, and Harry climbs back on. The Slytherin seeker is after the Snitch. Harry takes off.}

 

Ron: Go!

Hagrid: Go go go!

 

Harry rams the Slytherin Seeker, then is butted out. He returns, smashing the Seeker again as the Snitch dives. The boys follow, but they approach the ground quickly. The Slytherin Seeker backs out, and Harry pulls up his broom as he follows the Snitch, feet above the ground. Harry stands up, and steps forward, trying to grab the ball. He goes too far, and topples off the broom with a yelp, tumbling on the ground. He gets up and lurches.

 

The crowd gasps. Hermione appears beside a tower to see.

 

Hagrid: Looks like he's gonna be sick!

 

Harry lurches and the Snitch pops out of his mouth. It lands in his hands.

 

Lee: He's got the Snitch! Harry Potter receives 150 points for catching the Snitch!

Hooch: {Blows whistle} Gryffindor win!

All: YAY!

Draco: No!

Hagrid: Yes!

Hermione: Whoo-hoo!

McGonagall: {Giggles happily}

 

Harry raises the Snitch into the air and the crowd, and his team, cheers.

 

Crowd: Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor! Go go Gryffindor!

 

 

Scene:

Harry, Hermione and Ron are walking along a path with Hagrid, talking.

 

Hagrid: Nonsense. Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom?

Harry: Who knows. Why was he trying to get past that 3 headed dog on Halloween?

Hagrid: Who told you 'bout Fluffy?

Ron: Fluffy?
Hermione: That thing has a name?

Hagrid: Well, of course he's got a name. He's mine. I bought him off an Irish feller I met down at the pub last year. Then I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the

Harry: Yes?

Hagrid: Shouldn'ta said that. Don't ask any more questions. That's top secret, that is.

Harry: But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it!

Hagrid: Codswallop. Professor Snape is a Hogwarts teacher.

Hermione: Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a curse when I see one. I've read all about them. You have to keep eye contact. And Snape wasn't blinking.

Harry: Exactly.

Hagrid: {sighs} Now, you listen to me, all three of you. You're meddlin' in things that ought not to be meddled in. It's dangerous. What that dog is guarding is strictly between Professor Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

Harry: Nicholas Flamel?

Hagrid: I shouldn't have said that. I should not have said that. I should not have said that. {Exit.}

Harry: Nicholas Flamel...Who's Nicholas Flamel?

Hermione: I don't know.

 

Scene: Christmas. The camera pans up to a snowy castle, then to Hagrid, who is bringing in a large tree. Inside the great hall, students are leaving and ghosts are singing (Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, ring the Hogwarts bell. Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas...) Hermione approaches the empty tables, wheeling a cart. She goes to Ron and Harry, who are playing chess.

 

Harry: Knight to E-5.

 

A piece moves across the board.

 

Ron thinks for a moment.

 

Ron: Queen to E-5.

 

A queen walks over to E-5 and clinks the knight away.

 

Hermione: That's totally barbaric!

Ron: That's wizard's chess. I see you've packed.

Hermione: See you haven't.

Ron: Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie. He's studying dragons there!

Hermione: Good. You can help Harry, then. He's going to go the library for information on Nicholas Flamel.

Ron: We've looked a hundred times!

Hermione: Not in the restricted section...Happy Christmas. {exits.}

Ron: I think we've had a bad influence on her.

 

Scene:

X-mas morning. Hedwig is perched in the boys' room, and Harry is asleep in bed.

 

Ron: {calling from downstairs} Harry, wake up! Come on Harry, wake up!

 

Harry gets up and runs to a balcony overlooking the common room, where Ron is standing next to a tree. He is wearing a sweater with an R on it.

 

Ron: Happy Christmas, Harry.

Harry: Happy Christmas, Ron. What are you wearing?

Ron: Oh, Mum made it for me. Looks like you've got one too!

Harry: I've got presents?

Ron: Yeah!

Harry: Oh! {Harry runs down the stairs.}

Ron: There they are. {Ron sits on a couch arm and eats jelly beans as Harry picks up a silver wrapped package. Harry takes out the card.}

Harry: "Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was returned to you. Use it well."

 

Harry opens the present. It is a cloak.

 

Ron: What is it?

Harry: Some kind of...cloak.

Ron: Well, let's see then. Put it on.

 

Harry puts the cloak on, and all of him disappears except for his head.

 

Ron: Whoa!

Harry: My body's gone!

Ron: I know what that is! That's an invisibility cloak!

Harry: I'm invisible??

Ron: {gets up} They're really rare. I wonder who gave it to you.

Harry: {comes over} There was no name. It just said, "Use it well."

 

Scene:

Late at night. A lantern and hand appear, but nothing else. The ensemble walk through the dark library and into the Restricted Section. The lamp is put down, and the cloak removed. Harry appears.

 

Harry: {Reading books} Famous fire eaters...15th Century Fiends...Flamel...Nicholas Flamel...where are you?

 

Harry picks up a book and opens it. A man's face appears.

 

Man: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

 

Harry slams the book shuts and puts it back.

 

Filchs voice: Who's there?! {Harry whips around, grabbing his cloak. The lamp falls and shatters.} I know you're in there. You can't hide. {Harry puts on his cloak and creeps around Filch.} Who is it? Show yourself!

 

Harry runs from the room, breathing heavily. He gets into the hall, where Mrs. Norris is. The cat meows and begins to follow him. Harry runs around a corner, just as Snape and Quirrell appear. Snape pushes Quirrell into the wall.

 

Quirrell: Severus...I-I thought...

Snape: You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrell.

Quirrell: W-what do you m-mean?

Snape: You know perfectly well what I mean. {Snape senses something. Harry stops breathing. Snape reaches out to grab something, but doesn't. He whips his finger back in front of Quirrell's face.} We'll have another chat soon...when you've had time to decide where your loyalties lie.

 

Filch appears, carrying the broken lamp.

 

Filch: Oh, Professors. I found this, in the Restricted Section. It's still hot. That means there's a student out of bed.

 

They all dart off. A door opens, and closes. On the other side, there is a vast, empty room that has a large mirror in the center. Harry appears and walks over to the mirror. In it, he sees two people appear.

 

Harry: Mum? {the woman nods and smiles} Dad? {nods and smiles. Harry reaches out to touch them, but only gets the mirror. Then, his mother puts her hand on his shoulder. He puts his own hand on his own shoulders, as if trying to feel her there.

 

Scene:

The boys' room. Harry comes whipping in, invisible.

 

Harry: Ron! You've really got to see this! Ron! You've got to see this! {pulls back covers. Ron wakes up.} Ron, Ron, come on. Get out of bed!

Ron: Why?

Harry: There's something you've got to see. Now, come on!

 

Scene:

Back in the mirror room. Harry and Ron appear as if magically and Harry runs to the mirror.

 

Harry: Come on. Come. Come look, it's my parents!

Ron: I only see me.

Harry: {moves over} Look in properly. Go on. Stand there. There. You see them, don't you? Thats my dad

Ron: That's me! Only, I'm head boy...and I'm holding the Quidditch cup! And bloody hell, I'm Quidditch Captain too! I look good. Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?

Harry: How can it? Both my parents are dead. {Harry smiles sadly.}

 

Scene:

Another night. Harry is sitting in front of the mirror. Dumbledore appears behind him.

 

Dumbledore: Back again, Harry? {Harry turns around and stands up.} I see that you, like so many before you, have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised. I trust by now you realize what it does. Let me give you a clue. The happiest man on earth would look into the mirror and see only himself, exactly as he is.

Harry: So, then it shows us what we want? Whatever we want?

Dumbledore: Yes...and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desires of our hearts. Now you, who have never known your family, you see them standing beside you. But remember this, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away in front of it, even gone mad. That is why tomorrow it will be moved to a new home, and I must ask you not to go looking for it again. It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry, and forget to live. {Harry looks back at the mirror.}

 

Scene:

Daytime. It is all snowy. Harry is out in a main courtyard, bundled up, with Hedwig on his arm. He stops and she lifts off, soaring away into the sky. When she returns, it is spring time.

 

Scene:

In the library. Harry and Ron are seated, reading. Hermione comes up with a huge book. She thumps it onto the table. Harry jumps.

 

Hermione: I had you looking in the wrong section! How could I be so stupid? I checked this out a few weeks ago for a bit of light reading.

Ron: This is light?

Hermione: {glares} Of course! Here it is! "Nicholas Flamel is the only known maker of the Philosopher's Stone!"

Ron and Harry: The what?

Hermione: Honestly, don't you two read? "The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will turn any metal into pure gold and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal."

Ron: Immortal?

Hermione: It means you'll never die.

Ron: I know what it means!

Harry: Shh!

Hermione: "The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel, the noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his 665th birthday!" That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor. That's what's under the trapdoor...the Philosopher's Stone!

 

They all look at each other.

 

Scene:

Nighttime. Hermione, Ron and Harry are running across the wet ground to Hagrids hut. They knock on the door and it opens.

 

Harry: Hagrid!

Hagrid: {clad in oven mitts and an apron} Oh, hello. Sorry, don't wish to be rude, but I'm in no fit state to entertain today. {Closes door.}

All 3: We know about the Philosopher's Stone!

{Door reopens.}

Hagrid: Oh.

{They all come into Hagrid's small hut.}

Harry: We think Snape's trying to steal it.

Hagrid: Snape? Blimey, Harry, you're not still on about him, are you?

Harry: Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know why.

Hagrid: Snape is one of the teachers protecting the Stone! He's not about to steal it!

Harry: What?

Hagrid: You heard. Right. Come on, now, I'm a bit preoccupied today.

Harry: Wait a minute. {Ron and a big black boarhound, FANG, meet. Fang sniffs Ron.} One of the teachers?
Hermione: {sitting in a large chair} Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there? Spells, enchantments.

Hagrid: That's right. Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

{Hermione looks at Ron, who is being sniffed in the face by Fang. Ron shuffles away.} Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy. Hehe, not a soul knows how. Except for me and Dumbledore. I shouldn't have told you that. I shouldn't have told you that. {A cauldron over a fire begins to rattle.} Oh! {Hagrid hurries over and grabs something} Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! {puts the thing, an egg, on the table. The group crowds around.}

Harry: Uh, Hagrid, what exactly is that?

Hagrid: That? It's a ... its um...

Ron: I know what that is! But Hagrid, how did you get one?

Hagrid: I won it. Off a stranger I met down at a pub. Seemed quite glad to be rid off it, as a matter of fact.

 

The egg rattles and cracks. Pieces fly off as a dragon emerges. It squeaks and slips on an egg piece.

 

Hermione: Is that...a dragon?

Ron: That's not just a dragon. That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works with these in Romania.

Hagrid: Isn't he beautiful? Oh. Bless him, look. He knows his mummy. Hehe. Hallo, Norbert. {The dragon squeaks as it looks at Hagrid.}

Harry: Norbert?

Hagrid: Yeah, well, he's got to have a name, doesn't he?

Ron: {laughs}

Hagrid: Don't you, Norbert? {raises fingers back and forth across Norberts chin} Dededede.

 

Norbert backs away, hiccups and blows a fireball of fire into Hagrid's beard.

 

Hagrid: Ohh! Oooh, ooh, ooh, well...he'll have to be trained up a bit, of course. {Norbert hiccups. Hagrid sees someone looking in the window.} Who's that? {The person scampers away.}

Harry: Malfoy.

Hagrid: Oh, dear.

 

Scene:

The three are walking back through a corridor. An owl screeches.

 

Harry: Hagrid always wanted a dragon. He told me so the first time I met him.

Ron: It's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows.

Harry: I don't understand. Is that bad?

Ron: It's bad.

 

They stop as McGonagall, in her nightgown, appears.

 

McGonagall: Good evening.

 

Malfoy appears smugly beside her.

 

Scene:

McGonagall's classroom. The three accused are standing in front of McGonagall's desk, while Malfoy is feet away, smirking.

 

McGonagall: Nothing, I repeat, nothing gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as punishment for your actions, 50 points will be taken.

Harry: 50?!

McGonagall: Each. And to ensure it doesn't happen again, all four of you will receive detention.

 

Malfoy nods, then his smile vanishes.

 

Draco: Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said..."the four of us."

 

McGonagall: No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy. You see, as honorable as your intentions were, you too were out of bed after hours. You will serve detention with your classmates.

 

Harry, Ron and Hermione grin, and Draco sags.

 

Scene:

Outside, at night, the four students are being led to Hagrid's hut by Mr. Filch.

 

Filch: A pity they let the old punishments die. There was a time detention would find you hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons. God, I miss the screaming. {Draco gulps, and Hermione rushes by.} You'll be serving detention with Hagrid tonight. He's got a little job to do inside the dark forest. {Hagrid appears with a crossbow. He sniffles.} A sorry lot this, Hagrid. Oh, good God, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are you?

 

Hagrid: {sniffs and sighs} Norbert's gone. Dumbledore sent him off to Romania to live in a colony.

Hermione: Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind.

Hagrid: Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania? {Filch rolls eyes.} What if the other dragons are mean to him? He's only a baby, after all.

Filch: Oh, for Gods sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the forest, after all. Got to have your wits about you.

Draco: The forest? I thought that was a joke! We can't go in there. Students aren't allowed. And there are...{a howl sounds}...werewolves!

Filch: There's more than werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be sure of that. {Draco looks frightened.} Nighty-night. {Exit.}

Hagrid: Right. Let's go.

 

Scene: In the forest. The group walks along a path to a tree. Hagrid stops, bends down and dips his fingers in a silver puddle. He pulls out his fingers and rubs them together. A silver trail smears with his fingers.

 

Harry: Hagrid, what's that?

Hagrid: What we're here for. See that? That's unicorn's blood, that is. I found one dead a few weeks ago. Now, this one's been injured bad by something. {Harry suddenly sees a large cloaked figure walking through the trees. He looks at Hagrid.} So, it's our job to find the poor beast. Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

Ron: {weakly} Okay.

Hagrid: And Harry, you'll go with Malfoy. {Draco grimaces, and Harry nods.}

Draco: Okay. Then I get Fang!

Hagrid: Fine. Just so you know, he's a bloody coward. {Fang whines.}

 

Scene:

Harry and Draco are walking through the forest, Fang leading. Draco has the lamp.

 

Draco: You wait till my father hears about this. This is servant's stuff.

Harry: If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared.

Draco: Scared, Potter?! {Scoffs} {howl} Did you hear that? Come on, Fang. Scared.

 

Scene:

The group approaches a flat ground with gnarled roots all over. Fang stops, then growls.

 

Harry: What is it, Fang?

 

Up ahead, a cloaked figure is crouched over a dead unicorn, drinking its blood. The figure raises its head, silver blood dripping from its mouth.

 

Harry gasps and grabs his scar, which is hurting.

 

Draco: {A look of pure fear} AHHHHHHHHH!!! AHHH! {runs away, with Fang} HELP!!!!!

 

Harry is left by himself. The figure slides over the unicorn and rises erect. It advances towards Harry, who backs up, but trips. He crawls backwards. Suddenly, there is the sound of hoofbeats. A figure leaps over Harry and lands near the cloaked figure. It is a silver centaur, FIRENZE. It rears, and the cloaked figure retreats, flying away.

 

Firenze: Harry Potter, you must leave. You are known to many creatures here. The forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you.

Harry: {rises} But what was that thing you saved me from?

Firenze: A monstrous creature. It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn. Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death. But at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that the moment the blood touches your lips, you will have a half-life. A cursed life.

Harry: But who would choose such a life?

Firenze: Can you think of no one?

Harry: Do you mean to say...that that thing that killed the unicorn...that was drinking its blood...that was Voldemort?

Firenze: Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment?

Harry: The Philosopher's Stone.

 

Suddenly, a dog (Fang) barks. Harry looks up and sees Hagrid, Hermione, Ron and Draco appear.

 

Hermione: Harry!

Hagrid: Hello there, Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You all right there, Harry? {Harry nods}
Firenze: Harry Potter, this is where I leave you. You're safe now. Good luck.
 
{Close up on the dead unicorn.}

 

Scene:

Gryffindor common room. Right after 'attack.' The group is around the fire. Hermione and Ron are seated, but Harry stands.

 

Hermione: You mean, You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest?

Harry: But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong. Snape doesn't want the stone for himself, he wants the stone for Voldemort. With the Elixir of Life, Voldemort will be strong again. He'll He'll come back. {Sits down.}

Ron: But if he comes back, you don't think he'll try to kill you, do you?

Harry: I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.

Ron: {Gulp} And to think, I've been worrying about my Potions final!

Hermione: Hang on a minute. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always feared?

{The boys shrug.} Dumbledore! As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe. As long as Dumbledore's around, you can't be touched. {Harry smiles slightly.}

 

Scene:

Some time later. In the outdoor courtyard. The three are walking.

 

Hermione: I've always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

Ron: Speak for yourself. All right there, Harry?

Harry: My scar. It keeps burning.

Hermione: It's happened before.

Harry: Not like this.

Ron: Perhaps you should see the nurse.

Harry: I think it's a warning. It means dangers coming. Uhh! {He rubs scar and then sees Hagrid across the field, at his hut.} Oh. Of course! {runs for hut.}

Hermione: What is it?

Harry: Don't you think it's a bit odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon, and a stranger shows up and just happens to have one? {They approach Hagrid, who is playing the Harry Potter theme on his flute.} I mean, how many people wander around with dragon eggs in their pockets? Why didn't I see it before? Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg? {Hagrid stops playing.} What did he look like?

Hagrid: I don't know. I never saw his face. He kept his hood up.

Harry: The stranger, though, you and he must have talked.

Hagrid: Well, he wanted to know what sort of creatures I looked after. I told him. I said, "After Fluffy, a dragon's gonna be no problem."

Harry: And did he seem interested in Fluffy?

Hagrid: Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy! How often do you come across a three headed dog, even if you're in the trade? But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast is to know how to calm him. Take Fluffy, for example, just play him a bit of music and he falls straight to sleep."

 

The three gape.

 

Hagrid: I shouldn't have told you that. {The three take off.} Where you going?! Wait!

 

Scene:

McGonagall's classroom. The three come tearing in and run up the aisles between desks. They pass a ghost and stop at the desk.

 

Harry: We have to see Professor Dumbledore, immediately!

McGonagall: I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

Harry: He's gone?! Now? But this is important! It's about...the Philosopher's Stone.

McGonagall: {shocked} How do you know

Harry: Someone's going to try and steal it.

McGonagall: I don't know how you three found out about the stone, but I can assure you it is perfectly well-protected. Now would you go back to your dormitories? Quietly. {They leave.}

 

Scene:

After exiting McGonagall's class, they walk down the hallway.

 

Harry: That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape, which means he knows how to get past Fluffy.

Hermione: And with Dumbledore gone

{Snape suddenly appears behind them}

Snape: Good afternoon. Now, what would three young Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on a day like this?

Hermione: Uh...we were just...

Snape: You want to be careful. People will think you're {Harry glares madly at Snape, who looks shocked} up to something. {Exit.}

Hermione: Now what do we do?

Harry: We go down the trapdoor. Tonight.

 

Scene: Nighttime. In the Gryffindor Common Room. The three friends come down the stairs and begin to walk across the floor. They stop when they hear croaking.

 

Harry: Trevor.

Ron: Trevor shh! Go, you shouldn't be here!

Neville: {appears behind a chair} Neither should you. You're sneaking out again, arent you?

Harry: Now, Neville, listen. We were

Neville: No! I won't let you! {stands} You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again! I-I'll fight you. {holds out fists.}

Hermione: Neville, I'm really, really sorry about this...{takes out wand} Petrificus Totalus.

 

Neville is frozen and falls backwards onto the ground. Hermione puts her wand back.

 

Ron: {Gulp} You're a little scary sometimes...you know that? Brilliant, but scary.

Harry: Let's go. {Walks by Neville} Sorry.

Hermione: Sorry.

Ron: It's for your own good, you know. {Exit.}

 

Scene: The three are under the Invisibility cloak, sneaking along the corridor.

 

Hermione: Ow! You stood on my foot!

Ron: Sorry. {A flame lights. Hermione draws out her wand and points it at the door.}

Hermione: Alohomora.

 

The door opens and they go in.

 

Ron: Wait a minute...he's....{a blow of air, and the cape flutters off them.} Sleeping.

Harry: Snape's already been here. He's put a spell on the harp. {They approach the sleeping dog.}

Ron: Uh. It's got horrible breath!

Harry: We have to move its paw.

Ron: What?!

Harry: Come on! {grabs paw, which is blocking the door.} Okay. Push! {They strain and move it. They open the door.} I'll go first. Don't follow until I give you a sign. {Fluffy's eyes open.} If something bad happens, get yourselves out...Does it seem a bit...quiet?

Hermione: The harp. It stopped playing.

 

Drool from one head comes down on Ron's shoulder.

 

Ron: Ew! Yuck! Ugh. {All three kids look up and see Fluffy standing there. Fluffy barks and growls, thrashing. It breaks the harp and dives at the three.}

Harry: Jump! Go! {They all jump through the trapdoor.}

Ron: Ahh! {gasps as he lands on some mushy black ropelike vines.} Whoa. Lucky this plant-thing is here, really.

Harry: Whoa! {The plant begins to move towards them.} Oh. Ahh! {The plant ties them up.}

Hermione: Stop moving, both of you. This is Devil's Snare. You have to relax. If you don't, it will only kill you faster.

Ron: Kill us faster?! Oh, now I can relax!

 

Hermione manages a smile as she is sucked down below.

 

Ron and Harry: Hermione!!

Ron: Now what are we gonna do?!

Hermione's voice: Just relax!

Harry: Hermione! Where are you?!

Hermione (from below): Do what I say. Trust me.

 

Harry relaxes and is sucked through.

 

Ron: Ahh! Harry!

 

Harry falls through and lands on the hard ground. Hermione goes over to him and he stands up.

 

Ron: Harry!

Hermione: Are you okay?

Harry: Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

Ron: Help!

Hermione: He's not relaxing, is he?

Harry: Apparently not.

Ron: Help! Help me!

Hermione: We've got to do something!

Harry: What?

Hermione: Uh! I remember reading something in Herbology. {Ron: Help!} Um Devil's Snare, Devil's Scare, {The snare shuts Ron's mouth} it's deadly fun...but will sulk in the sun! That's it! Devil's Snare hates sunlight! {takes out wand and points upwards.} Lumus Solem! {A beam of light shoots out. The Snare shrieks and recoils. Ron falls below.}

Ron: Ahhh!

Harry: Ron, are you okay?

Ron: Yeah.

Harry: Okay.

Ron: {stands} Whew. Lucky we didn't panic!

Harry: Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology.

 

There is a sound.

 

Hermione: What is that?

Harry: I don't know. Sounds like wings.

 

They enter into a room filled with golden "birds."

 

Hermione: Curious. I've never seen birds like these.

Harry: They're not birds, they're keys. And I'll bet one of them fits that door. {They come upon a broomstick, suspended in the air.}

Hermione: What's this all about?

Harry: I don't know. Strange.

{Ron creeps over to the door and takes out his wand.}

Ron: {rattles lock.} Alohomora! {Shrugs} Well, it was worth a try.

Hermione: Ugh! What're we going to do? There must be 1000 keys up there!

Ron: We're looking for a big old fashioned one. Probably rusty like the handle.

Harry: There! I see it! {points} The one with the broken wing! {He looks at the broom.}

Hermione: What's wrong, Harry?

Harry: It's too simple.

Ron: Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape can catch it on that old broomstick, you can! You're the youngest seeker in a century!

 

Harry nods and grabs the broom. All the keys suddenly go one direction, right at Harry. He climbs on, swiping at them.

 

Ron: This complicates things a bit!

 

Harry pushes off into the air. He flies off, after the key. The others follow him. Harry grabs the key.

 

Harry: Catch the key!

 

He zooms by and throws the key to Hermione, who catches it and heads for the lock while Harry distracts the other keys. Hermione puts it in the lock.

 

Ron: Hurry up!

 

The door opens, and Hermione and Ron rush through, followed by Harry. They shut the door just as the keys slam up against it.

 

Scene:

They enter a dark room, with broken pieces all around it.

 

Hermione: I don't like this. I don't like this at all.

Harry: Where are we? A graveyard.

Ron: This is no graveyard. {sighs} It's a chessboard. {Walks out onto the marble board and flames light, illuminating the board and GIANT players. Harry and Hermione come up with him.}

Harry: There's the door.

 

They walk across the board, towards the door. Suddenly, as they reach a line of pawns, the pawns bring up their swords. The three jump and back up.

 

Hermione: Now what do we do?

Ron: It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. All right. Harry, you take the Bishop's square. Hermione, you'll be the Queen's side castle. As for me, I'll be a knight. {They all take their places.}

Hermione: What happens now?

Ron: {aboard a horse.} Well, white moves first, and then...we play. {A pawn on the other side moves forward. Ron studies the game.}

Hermione: Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like...real wizard's chess, do you?

Ron: You there! D-5! {A black pawn moves forward, diagonal to the white pawn. The white pawn raises its swords and smashes the black one. The three jump.} Yes, Hermione, I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess!

 

The game continues. Pieces smash each other, boom! Boom!

Ron: Castle to E-4! Smash! Ron: Pawn to C-3! Smash! Boom! The Queen turns, and smashes a piece! Harry, Ron and Hermione wince. The Queen turns again. Both Ron and Harry study the game.

 

Harry: Wait a minute.

Ron: You understand right, Harry. Once I make my move, the Queen will take me...then you'll be free to check the King.

Harry: No, Ron! No!

Hermione: What is it?

Harry: He's going to sacrifice himself!

Hermione: No, Ron, you can't! {Ron closes his eyes.} There must be another way!

Ron: {turns to face Hermione.} Do you want to stop Snape or not? Harry, it's you that has to go on. I know it. Not me, not Hermione, you. {Harry nods.} Knight...to H-3.

 

Ron's horse moves forward, slides and stops.

 

Ron: Check.

 

The Queen turns and advances. Ron breathes faster, clutching the steel reins. The Queen stops. SMASH! Ron goes flying off the horse and lands on the floor, unconscious.

 

Ron: Ahhhh!

Harry: RON! {Hermione starts walking to him.} NO! Don't move! Dont forget, we're still playing. {Hermione moves back. Harry walks the diagonal in front of the King.} Checkmate. {The Kings sword falls onto the ground victory. Harry breathes out and then the two run to Ron. They bend beside him.} Take care of Ron. Then, go to the owlery. Send a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right...I have to go on.

Hermione: You'll be okay, Harry. You're a great wizard, you really are.

Harry: Not as good as you.

Hermione: {smile} Me? Books and cleverness? There are more important things. Friendship, and bravery. And Harry, just be careful.

 

Harry nods and stands, walking away.

 

 

Scene:

Harry walks down a long staircase to an empty room with pillars around it. The Mirror of Erised is in the middle of the room, and a man is standing before it. It is Quirrell. Harry yelps and grabs his scar.

 

Harry: You? {Quirrell turns around.} No. It can't be...Snape. He was the one

Quirrell: Yes. He does seem the type, doesn't he? Next to me, who would suspect, "p-p-poor s-stuttering Professor Quirrell?"

Harry: B-but, that day, during the Quidditch Match, Snape tried to kill me.

Quirrell: No, dear boy. I tried to kill you! And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would have succeeded. Even with Snape muttering his little counter-curse.

Harry: Snape was trying to...save me?

Quirrell: I knew you were a danger right from the off. Especially after Halloween.

Harry: Th-then you let the troll in.

Quirrell: Very good Potter, yes. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While everyone else was running to the dungeon, he went to the 3rd floor to head me off. He, of course, never trusted me again. He rarely left me alone. {Quirrell turns back to the mirror and Harry's scar hurts.} But he doesn't understand. I'm never alone. Never. Now...what does this mirror do? I see what I desire. I see myself holding the stone. But how do I get it?

{A raspy voice, VOLDEMORT, calls.}: Use the boy.

Quirrell: Come here, Potter, now!

 

Harry walks forward shakily.

 

Quirrell: Tell me. What do you see?

 

Harry looks in the mirror. He sees himself. His mirror self brings his hand into his pocket and takes out a red stone! The mirror self winks and puts the stone back. Very subtly, Harry reaches to his pocket. There is a lump. He gasps.

 

Quirrell: What is it?! What do you see?!

Harry: I-I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I've won the house cup.

Voldemort's voice: He lies.

Quirrell: Tell the truth! What do you see?!

Voldemort's voice: Let me speak to him.

Quirrell: Master, you are not strong enough.

Voldemort's voice: I have strength enough for this. {Quirrell unwraps his turban and on the side opposite his face, another face is planted. It is Voldemort who appears kind of like a snake. He stretches out and faces Harry via the mirror.} Harry Potter. We meet again.

Harry: Voldemort.

Voldemort: Yes. You see what I have become? See what I must do to survive? Live off another. A mere parasite. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But there is something that can. Something, that conveniently enough, lies in your pocket!

 

Harry turns and runs.

 

Voldemort: Stop him! {Quirrell snaps his fingers and fire erupts all around the room. Harry is stuck.} Don't be a fool! Why suffer a horrific death when you can join me and live?!

Harry: {shakes his head} Never!

Voldemort: Haha. Bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry, would you like to see your mother and father again? Together, we can bring them back. {In the mirror, Harrys parents faces appear.} All I ask for is something in return. {Harry takes the stone from his pocket.} That's it, Harry. There is no good and evil. There is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do extraordinary things. Just give me the stone! {Mother and father vanish.}

Harry: You liar!

Voldemort: Kill him!

 

Quirrell soars into the air and smashes into Harry, one hand on Harrys throat. They fall to the steps. The stone falls out of Harry's reach as Quirrell chokes him. Harry strains and squeaks. Suddenly, Harry puts his hand on Quirrell's, trying to get him off. Smoke furls from under his hand.

 

Quirrell: Ahh! Ahh! {backs up. His hand is crumbling into a mountain of black ash.} What is this magic? {hand dissipates.}

Voldemort: Fool! Get the stone!

Quirrell: {Walks forward, but Harry puts both hands on his face.} Ahhhhhhhhhh!

 

Quirrell backs up, then his face, which is horrendously burned, crumbles as he walks forward. His whole body is ash. He falls to the floor. Harry gasps. He looks at his own hands and hurries over to the stone. He picks it up and sighs, when he hears something. Turning, Harry sees a dust clouds with Voldemort's face. The cloud rushes forward, right through Harry!

 

Voldemort: Arrrhhhhhh!

Harry: Ahhhhhhhhh! {Voldemort flies away. Harry falls to the ground, unconscious. He holds the stone in an outstretched hand.}

 

Scene:

The hospital wing. Harry is bandaged, lying in bed. He awakens, puts on his glasses, and sits up. There are cards and candy all over. Dumbledore approaches him.

 

Dumbledore: Good afternoon, Harry. Ah. Tokens from your admirers?

Harry: Admirers?

Dumbledore: What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret, so, naturally, the whole school knows. {Both smile.} Ah, I see your friend Ronald has saved you the trouble of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

Harry: Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione?
Dumbledore: Fine. They're both just fine.

Harry: But, what happened to the Stone?

Dumbledore: Relax, dear boy. The stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicholas and I had a little chat and agreed it was best all around.

Harry: But Flamel, he'll die, won't he?

Dumbledore: {sits on the bed.} He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But yes, he will die.

Harry: How is it I got the Stone, sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror, and the next...

Dumbledore: Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone, find it, but not use it, would be able to get it. That is one of my more brilliant ideas. And between you and me thats saying something. {Smile both.}

Harry: Does that mean, with the Stone gone, I mean, that Voldemort can never come back?

Dumbledore: Ah, I'm afraid there are ways in which he can return. Harry, do you know why Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to have you touch him? {Harry shakes his head.} It was because of your mother. She sacrificed herself for you, and that kind of act leaves a mark. {Harry touches his scar.} No, no, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin.

Harry: What is it?

Dumbledore: Love, Harry, love. {Pats Harry's head and stands up.} Ah. Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans. I was most unfortunate in my youth to come across a vomit flavoured one, and since then I have lost my liking for them. But I think I could be safe with a nice toffee...{takes brown bean and eats it.} Mm. Alas. Earwax.

 

Scene:

Harry approaches a room where up on a stairwell balcony Hermione and Ron are talking. They stop when they see Harry and lean over the railing.

 

Harry: All right there, Ron?

Ron: All right? You?

Harry: {shrug} All right. Hermione?

Hermione: {smile} Never better.

 

Scene:

In the great hall. All students are seated, and green banners with snakes on them are around the ceiling.

Dumbledore, at the head table, nods to McGonagall.

She dings her glass and the chatter stops. Dumbledore rises.

 

Dumbledore: Another year gone. And now, as I understand it, the house cup needs awarding, and the points stand thus. In fourth place, Gryffindor with 312 points. {Clapping. Harry and Hermione hide their heads.} Third place, Hufflepuff, with 352 points. {Clapping.} In second place, Ravenclaw, with 426 points. {Clapping.} And in first place, with 472 points, Slytherin House.

 

There is immense cheering.

 

Students: Whoo! Yeah!

Draco: Nice one, Mate! {sees Ron looking at him and sneers.}

Dumbledore: Yes, yes, well done Slytherin, well done Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. And I have a few last minute points to award. {The Gryffindor students look up.} To Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool intellect when others were in great peril, 50 points. {Applause.}

Harry: {Pats} Good job.

Dumbledore: Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley, for the best played game of chess {Ron looks at Harry and mouths, 'Me?' Harry nods, and mouths, 'You!'} that Hogwarts has seen these many years...50 points. {Applause} And third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house 60 points. {Immense cheering.}

Hermione: We're tied with Slytherin!

Dumbledore: And finally, it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to your enemies, but a great deal more to stand up to your friends. I award 10 points to Neville Longbottom.

 

Immense cheering erupts. Neville is unbelieving, and sits there while cheering gets louder. Draco is downfallen.

 

Dumbledore: Assuming that my calculations are correct, I believe that a change of direction is in order. {Claps. The green banners change to Gryffindor red and yellow.} Gryffindor wins the House Cup!

 

Cheering.

 

Hagrid: Yes! {grins}

 

All students stand and throw their hats into the air, except Draco, who smashes his down onto the table.

 

Seamus: Neville! {Shakes his hand.}

 

All rub each other's hair and jump around, cheering and laughing.

 

Lee: Yeah! We won!! {Jumps with Harry, who looks back and grins very widely.}

 

Scene:

The outdoor train station. Students are walking around, getting in the train.

 

Hagrid: Come on now, hurry up. You'll be late. Train's leaving. Go on. Go on. Come on. Hurry up.

 

Harry hands Hedwig to a train man, and walks to an open door of the train with Hermione. Hermione waves to Hagrid, who waves back. Hermione gets in the train.

 

Hermione: Come on, Harry.

Harry: One minute. {He walks over to Hagrid.}

Hagrid: Thought you were leaving without saying good-bye, didja? {Hagrid takes a red album out of his coat pocket and hands it to Harry.} This is for you.

 

Harry opens the album and sees a picture, moving, of him as a baby with his parents. They are all smiling and waving. Harry smiles.

 

Harry: Thanks, Hagrid. {Shakes Hagrid's hand, then hugs him tightly.}

Hagrid: Oh. Go on...on with you. {Harry lets go.} Oh, listen, Harry, if that dolt of a cousin of yours, Dudley, gives you any grief, you could always, um, threaten him with a nice pair of ears to go with that tail of his.

Harry: But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that.

Hagrid: I do. But your cousin don't, do he? Eh? {chuckle} Off you go.

 

Harry walks away, back to the train door where Hermione and Ron are waiting.

 

Hermione: Feels strange to be going home, doesn't it?

Harry: I'm not going home. Not really.

UNCLE VERNON: Im warning you, if you cant control that bloody bird itll have to go.
HARRY: But shes bored! If I could only let out for an hour or two-
UNCLE VERNON: Huh, huh! So you could send secret messages to you freaky little friends. No, sir!
HARRY: But I havent had any messages from any of my friends... not one... all summer.
DUDLEY: Whod want to be friends with you?
UNCLE VERNON: I should think youd be a little more grateful. Weve raised you since you were a baby, given you the food off our table, even let you have Dudleys second bedroom, purely out of the goodness of our hearts.
AUNT PETUNIA: Not now, Bopkins. For when the Masons arrive.
UNCLE VERNON: Which should be any minute! Ahem... Now lets go over our schedule once again, shall we? Petunia when the Masons arrive you will be...?
AUNT PETUNIA: ...in the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously into our home.
UNCLE VERNON: Good! And- and Dudley, you will be...?
DUDLEY: Ill be waiting to open the door!
UNCLE VERNON: Excellent! ...And you...?

DOBBY: Oh, oh yes, sir! Dobby understands! Its just that, Dobby has come to
tell you- it is difficult, sir- Dobby wonders where to begin?

Ohh, ho, hoo...
HARRY: Dobby, ssh! Im sorry! I didnt mean to offend you, or anything.
DOBBY: Offend Dobby? Dobby has heard of your greatness, sir, but never has he
been asked to sit down by a wizard, like an equal.
HARRY: You cant have met many decent wizards then.
DOBBY: No, I havent. That was an awful thing to say. Bad Dobby!

family, sir.
HARRY: Your family?
DOBBY: The wizard family Dobby serves, sir. Dobby is bound to serve one
family forever. If they ever knew Dobby was here...ooh... But Dobby had to
come. Dobby has to protect Harry Potter- to warn him. Harry Potter must not
go back to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry this year! There is a
plot, a plot to make most terrible things happen.
HARRY: What terrible things? Whos plotting them?
DOBBY: Ooo... er... cant... say... argh...

HARRY: Sorry.
UNCLE VERNON: One more sound, and youll wish youd never been born, boy! And
fix that door!
HARRY: Yes, sir... See why Ive got to go back? I dont belong here. I belong
in your world, at Hogwarts. Its the only place Ive got friends!
DOBBY: Friends who dont even write to Harry Potter?
HARRY: Well, I expect theyve... been- hang on- how do you know my friends
havent been writing to me?
DOBBY: Harry Potter mustnt be angry with Dobby. Heh- Dobby hoped, if Harry

course, I dont blame you, Harry dear.
RON: They were starving him, Mum. There were bars on his window!

Ronald Weasley! Come on Harry, time for a spot of breakfast. Here we are
Harry. Now tuck in! Thats it. There we go.
GINNY: Mum- Mummy, have you seen my jumper?

HARRY: Oh, sorry sir. Im Harry, sir, Harry Potter.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Good Lord! Are you really? Well, Rons told us all about you,
of course. When did he get here?

Surrey and back last night.

FRED, GEORGE, RON, HARRY: Oh, it...
MRS. WEASLEY: Arthur!
ARTHUR WEASLEY: I mean...that was very wrong, indeed, boys. Very wrong of
you. Now, Harry, you must know all about Muggles. Tell me, what exactly is
the function of a rubber duck?

Percy, please?

too far...
OTHER: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Gilderoy Lockhart.
MRS. WEASLEY: Ah! Here he is!
RON: Mum fancies him.
PHOTOGRAPHER: Make way there. Please! Let me by, madam. Thank you. Excuse me,
little girl. This is for the Daily Prophet.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: It cant be- Harry Potter?
PHOTOGRAPHER: Harry Potter! Excuse me, madam.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Nice big smile, Harry. Together you and I rate the front
page! Ladies and gentlemen, what an extraordinary moment this is. When young
Harry stepped into Flourish and Blotts this morning to purchase my
autobiography, Magical Me,... which, incidentally is currently celebrating
its 27th week atop the Daily Prophet bestseller list, he had no idea that he
would, in fact, be leaving... with my entire collected works, free of charge.
Now, ladies?
MRS. WEASLEY: Harry, now you give me those, and Ill get them signed. All of
you wait outside. Thats it, Ron.
DRACO: Ill bet you loved that, didnt you, Potter? Famous Harry Potter!
Cant even go into a bookshop without making the front page.
GINNY: Leave him alone.
DRACO: Oh look, Potter. Youve got yourself a girlfriend.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Now, now Draco, play nicely. Mr. Potter... Lucius Malfoy. We
meet at last. Forgive me, your scar is legend, as, of course, is the wizard
who gave it to you.
HARRY: Voldemort killed my parents. He was nothing more than a murderer.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Hmm. You must be very brave, to mention his name...or very
foolish.
HERMIONE: Fear of a name only increase fear of the thing itself.
LUCIUS MALFOY: And you must be... Miss Granger. Yes, Dracos told me all
about you, and your parents. Muggles, arent they? Let me see...red hair...
vacant expressions... tatty second hand book. You must be the Weasleys.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Children, its mad in here! Lets go outside.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Well, well, well. Weasley senior.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: Lucius.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Busy time at the Ministry, Arthur, all those extra raids? I do
hope theyre paying you overtime, but judging by the state of this, Id say
not. Whats the use in being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they dont
even pay you well for it.
ARTHUR WEASLEY: We have a very different idea about what disgraces the name
of wizard, Malfoy.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Clearly. Associating with Muggles... and I thought your family
could sink no lower. Ill see you at work.
DRACO: See you at school.

RON: Honestly, Professor Snape, I think it did more damage to us.
SNAPE: Silence! I assure you, that were you in Slytherin, and your fate
rested with me, the both of you would be on the train home- tonight. As it

DUMBLEDORE: ...They are not.

SNAPE: Headmaster, these boys have flouted the Decree for the Restriction of
Underage Wizardry. As such--
DUMBLEDORE: I am well aware of our bylaws, Severus, having written quite a
few of them myself. However, as head of Gryffindor house, it is for Professor
McGonagall to determine the appropriate action.
RON: Well go and get our stuff, then.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: What are you talking about, Mr. Weasley?
RON: Youre going to expel us, arent you?

me the properties of the Mandrake root? Yes, Miss Granger.
HERMIONE: Mandrake, or Mandragora, is used to return those who have been
Petrified to their original state. Its also quite dangerous. The Mandrakes
cry is fatal to anyone who hears it.
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Excellent! Ten points to Gryffindor! Now, as our Mandrakes
are still only seedlings their cries wont kill you yet. But they could knock
you out for several hours, which is why I have given each of you a pair of
earmuffs for auditory protection. So, could you please put them on, right
away? Quickly! Flaps tight down, and watch me closely. You grasp your
Mandrake firmly, you pull it sharply up out of the pot...
All: Aah! Ooh!
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Got it? And... now you dunk it down into the other pot and
pour a little sprinkling of soil to keep him warm.
NEVILLE: Uhh...
PROFESSOR SPROUT: Uh, Longbottoms been neglecting his earmuffs.

Now- be warned! It is my job to arm you against the foulest creatures known

Know only that no harm can befall you whilst I am here. I must ask you not to
scream. It might... provoke them!
SEAMUS: Cornish pixies?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Freshly caught Cornish pixies!
SEAMUS: Ha, ha. Ha, ha, ha...

HARRY: Malfoy. He called Hermione, ...um, well, I dont- I dont know exactly
what it means.
HERMIONE: He called me a Mudblood.
HAGRID: He did not!
HARRY: Whats a Mudblood?
HERMIONE: It means dirty blood. Mudbloods a really foul name for someone
who is Muggle-born. Someone with non-magic parents. Someone like me. Its not
a term one usually hears in civilized conversation.
HAGRID: See, the thing is, Harry, therere some wizards, like the Malfoy
family, who think theyre bettern everyone else because theyre what people
call pure blood.
HARRY: Thats horrible!
RON: (Blech...) Its disgusting.
HAGRID: And its codswallop, to boot. Dirty blood. Why, there isnt a
wizard alive today thats not half blood or less. More ter the point, theyve

OTHER: Ravenclaws, follow me!
DUMBLEDORE: Shes not dead, Argus. She has been Petrified.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Ah, thought so. So unlucky I wasnt there. I know exactly
the counter curse that could have spared her.
DUMBLEDORE: But how she has been Petrified, I cannot say...
FILCH: Ask him. Its him whos done it. You saw what he wrote on the wall.
HARRY: Its not true sir, I swear. I never touched Mrs. Norris.
FILCH: Rubbish!
SNAPE: If I might, Headmaster? Perhaps Potter and his friends were simply in
the wrong place at the wrong time. However, the circumstances are suspicious.
I, for one, dont recall seeing Potter at dinner.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Im afraid thats my doing, Severus. You see, Harry was
helping me answer my fan mail.
HERMIONE: Thats why Ron and I went looking for him, Professor. Wed just
found him when he said...
SNAPE: Yes, Miss Granger?
HARRY: When I said I wasnt hungry. We were heading back to the common room
when we found Mrs. Norris.
DUMBLEDORE: Innocent until proven guilty, Severus.
FILCH: My cat has been Petrified. I wanna see some punishment!
DUMBLEDORE: We will be able to cure her, Argus. As I understand it, Madame
Sprout has a very healthy growth of Mandrakes. When matured, a potion will be
made which will revive Mrs. Norris. And in the meantime, I strongly recommend
caution... to all.

Weasley. One, two, three. Vera verto.
RON: Ahem. Vera verto!
OTHERS: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: That wand needs replacing, Mr. Weasley. Yes, Miss
Granger?
HERMIONE: Professor, I was wondering if you could tell us about...the Chamber
of Secrets?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, very well. Well, you all know, of course, that
Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by the four greatest witches
and wizards of the age: Godric Gryffindor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena
Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. Now, three of the founders coexisted quite
harmoniously. One did not.
RON: Three guesses who.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Salazar Slytherin wished to be more selective about the
students admitted to Hogwarts. He believed magical learning should be kept
within all-magic families. In other words, pure-bloods. Unable to sway the
others, he decided to leave the school. Now, according to legend, Slytherin
had built a hidden chamber in this castle, known as the Chamber of Secrets.
Though, shortly before departing, he sealed it until that time when his own
true heir returned to the school. The heir alone would be able to open the
Chamber and unleash the horror within, and by so doing purge the school of
all those who, in Slytherins view, were unworthy to study magic.
HERMIONE: Muggle-borns.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, naturally, the school had been searched many
times. No such chamber has been found.
HERMIONE: Professor? What exactly does legend tell us lies within the
Chamber?
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Well, the Chamber is said to home to something that
only the Heir of Slytherin can control. It is said to be the home of a
monster.

RON: Dyou think its true? Dyou think there really is a Chamber of Secrets?
HERMIONE: Yes. Couldnt you tell? McGonagalls worried. All the teachers are.
HARRY: Well, if there really is a Chamber of Secrets, a-and it really has
been opened, then that means---
HERMIONE: The Heir of Slytherin has returned to Hogwarts. The question is,
who is it?
RON: Lets think. Who do we know who thinks all Muggle-borns are scum?
HERMIONE: If youre talking about Malfoy-
RON: Of course. You heard him! Youll be next Mudbloods,
HERMIONE: I heard him. But Malfoy, the Heir of Slytherin?
HARRY: Well, maybe Rons right, Hermione. I mean, look at his family. The
whole lot of them have been in Slytherin for centuries.
RON: Crabbe and Goyle must know. Maybe we could trick them into telling.
HERMIONE: Even they arent that thick. But there might be another way. Mind
you, it would be difficult. Not to mention, we would be breaking about fifty
school rules. And, itll be dangerous. Very dangerous.

RON: Do you mean, if Harry and I drink that stuff, well turn into Crabbe and
Goyle?
HERMIONE: Yes.
RON: Wicked! Malfoyll tell us anything.
HERMIONE: Exactly. But its tricky. Ive never seen a more complicated
potion.
HARRY: Well, how long will it take to make?
HERMIONE: A month.
HARRY: A month? But, Hermione, if Malfoy is the Heir of Slytherin, he could
attack half the Muggle-borns in the school by then.

huh, huh, huh! Aah, ahh...

Terrible things are about to happen at Hogwarts. Harry Potter must not stay

you all hear me? Excellent! In light of the dark events of recent weeks,
Professor Dumbledore has granted me permission to start this little Dueling
Club to train you all up in case you ever need to defend yourselves, as I
myself have done on countless occasions- for full details, see my published
works. Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape. He has sportingly
agreed to help me with a short demonstration. Now, I dont want any of you
youngsters to worry- youll still have your Potions master when Im through
with him, never fear. One, two, three-
SNAPE: Expelliarmus!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Whoaah!
HERMIONE: Do you think hes all right?
RON: Who cares?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: An excellent idea to show them that, Professor Snape, but
if you dont mind me saying, it was pretty obvious- ah- what you were about
to do. And if I had wanted to stop you, it would have been only too easy.
SNAPE: Perhaps it would be prudent to first teach the students to block
unfriendly spells, Professor.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: An excellent suggestion, Professor Snape! Ah... Lets
have a volunteer pair! Um, Potter, Weasley, how about you?
SNAPE: Weasleys wand causes devastation with the simplest spells. Well be
sending Potter to the hospital wing in a matchbox. Might I suggest someone
from my own house? Malfoy, perhaps?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Good luck, Potter.
HARRY: Thank you, sir.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Wands at the ready.
DRACO: Scared, Potter?
HARRY: You wish.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: On the count of three, cast your charms to disarm your
opponent- only to disarm. We dont want any accidents here. One, two--
DRACO: Everte statium!
HERMIONE: Oh!
CRABBE: Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!
HARRY: Rictusempra!

Scene 18: A Parselmouth.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: I said disarm only!
DRACO: Serpensortia!
SNAPE: Dont move, Potter. Ill get rid of it for you.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Allow me, Professor Snape. Alarte ascendare!
HARRY: Sya- hassa- she. Sya- hasi- heth. Sya- hasi- heth.
SNAPE: Vipera evenesca.
JUSTIN FINCH-FLETCHLEY: What are you playing at?
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts  Gryffindor common room - daytime
RON: Youre a Parselmouth? Why didnt you tell us?
HARRY: Im a what?
HERMIONE: You can talk to snakes.
HARRY: I know. I mean, I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the
zoo once. Uh, once! But, so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.
HERMIONE: No, they cant. Its not a very common gift, Harry. This is bad.
HARRY: Whats bad? If I hadnt told that snake not to attack Justin-
RON: Oh, thats what you said to it!
HARRY: You were there! You heard me!
RON: I heard you speaking Parseltongue. Snake language?
HARRY: I spoke a different language? But- I didnt realize I- how can I speak
a language without knowing I can?
HERMIONE: I dont know, Harry, but it sounded like you were egging the snake
on, or something. Harry, listen to me. Theres a reason the symbol of
Slytherin House is a serpent. Salazar Slytherin was a Parselmouth. He could
talk to snakes, too.
RON: Exactly! Now the whole schools gonna think youre his great- great-
great grandson, or something.
HARRY: But Im not... I cant be.
HERMIONE: He lived a thousand years ago; for all we know, you could be.

what I said last year-- you would have done well in Slytherin.
HARRY: Youre wrong.
SORTING HAT: Umm...
FAWKES: (Brrr...) (Poof)
DUMBLEDORE: Harry?
HARRY: Professor! Sir, your bird- there was nothing I could do- he- he just
caught fire!
DUMBLEDORE: Oh, and about time, too. Hes been looking dreadful for days.
Pity you had to see him on a burning day. Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. They
burst into flame when it is time for them to die, and then they are reborn
from the ashes.
FAWKES: (Brrrt)
DUMBLEDORE: Ah, fascinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely
heavy loads, and their- their tears have healing powers.
HAGRID: Professor Dumbledore, sir! Wait! Listen! Professor Dumbledore, sir,
it wasnt Harry!
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid-
HAGRID: In fact, Id be prepared ter swear it in front o the Ministry of
Magic!
DUMBLEDORE: Hagrid! Relax. I do not believe that Harry attacked anyone.
HAGRID: Well, of course you dont, and... Oh... Oh, right. Well, Ill, um-
hum. Ill just wait outside, then.
DUMBLEDORE: Yes.
HARRY: You dont think it was me, Professor?
DUMBLEDORE: No, Harry. I do not think it was you... But I must ask you, is
there something you wish to tell me?

HARRY: Crabbe and Goyle.
HERMIONE: We also need to make sure that the real Crabbe and Goyle cant
burst in on us while were interrogating Malfoy.
RON: How?
HERMIONE: Ive got it all worked out. I filled these with a simple Sleeping
Draught. Simple, but powerful. Now, once theyre asleep hide them in the
broomstick cupboard and pull out a few of their hairs, and put on their
uniforms.
RON: Whose hair are you ripping out then?
HERMIONE: Ive already got mine. Millicent Bulstrode Slytherin- I got this
off her robes. Im going to go check on the Polyjuice Potion. Make sure that
Crabbe and Goyle find these.

Crabbe.
RON (as CRABBE): Uh... Bloody hell.
HARRY (as GOYLE): Excellent.
RON (as CRABBE): But wheres Hermione?
HERMIONE: I- I dont think Im going. You go on without me!

here?
PERCY: I happen to be a school prefect. You, on the other hand, have no
business wandering the corridors at this time of night. What are your names
again?
RON (as CRABBE): Uhh...
HARRY (as GOYLE): Im...
DRACO: Crabbe, Goyle! Where have you two been? Pigging out in the Great Hall
all this time? Why are you wearing glasses?
HARRY (as GOYLE): Ah- um... Reading.
DRACO: Reading?
HARRY (as GOYLE): Uh-huh.
DRACO: I didnt know you could read. And what are you doing down here,
Weasley?
PERCY: Mind your attitude, Malfoy.
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts  Slytherin common room - night
DRACO: Well, sit down. Youd never know the Weasleys were pure-bloods, the
way they behave. Theyre an embarrassment to the wizarding world. All of
them. Whats wrong with you, Crabbe?
RON (as CRABBE): Ahem...Stomachache.
DRACO: You know, Im surprised that the Daily Prophet hasnt done a report on
all these attacks. I suppose Dumbledore is trying to hush it all up. Father
always said Dumbledore was the worst thing that ever happened to this place.
HARRY (as GOYLE): Youre wrong!
DRACO: What? You think theres someone here whos worse than Dumbledore?
Well? Do you?
HARRY (as GOYLE): Harry Potter? (gulp)
DRACO: Good one, Goyle. Youre absolutely right. Saint Potter. And people
actually think that hes the Heir of Slytherin!
HARRY (as GOYLE): But then you must have some idea whos behind it all.
DRACO: You know I dont Goyle. I told you yesterday. How many times do I have
to tell you? Is this yours? But my father did say this: Its been fifty years
since the Chamber was opened. He wouldnt tell me who opened it-- only that
they were expelled. The last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a
Mudblood died. So, its only a matter of time before one of them is killed
this time. As for me, I hope its Granger. Whats the matter with you two?
Youre acting very...odd.
HARRY (as GOYLE): Its his... stomachache. Calm down.
RON (as CRABBE): S- scar.
HARRY (as GOYLE): Hair!

HARRY: Hermione? A- are you OK?
MOANING MYRTLE: Aaah!
HERMIONE: Do you remember me telling you that the Polyjuice Potion was only
for human transformations? It was cats hair I plucked off Millicent
Bulstrodes robes. Look at my face.

thinks its funny to throw a book at me.
RON: But, it cant hurt if someone throws something at you. I mean, itll
just go right through you.
MOANING MYRTLE: Sure! Lets all throw books at Myrtle because she cant feel
it! Ten points if you get through her stomach! Fifty points if it goes
through her head!
HARRY: But, who threw it at you, anyway?
MOANING MYRTLE: I dont know, I didnt see them. I was just sitting in the U-

DUMBLEDORE: Im afraid they are, Tom. They are true.
TOM RIDDLE: About the school, as well? I dont have a home to go to. They
wouldnt really close Hogwarts, would they Professor?

choice.

HAGRID: You cant! You dont understand.
TOM RIDDLE: The dead girls parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts
can do is make sure the thing that killed their daughter is slaughtered.

snitch to me.
HARRY: The monster had killed somebody, Ron. What would any of us have done?

it?

students will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No exceptions. I
should tell you this: unless the culprit behind these attacks is caught, it
is likely the school will be closed.
HARRY: Weve got to talk to Hagrid, Ron. I cant believe its him, but if he
did set the monster loose last time, hell know how to get inside the Chamber
of Secrets, and thats a start.

Dumbledore, sir!
DUMBLEDORE: Good evening, Hagrid. I wonder, could we...?
HAGRID: Of course! Come in! Come in.
RON: Thats Dads boss! Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic!
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Bad business, Hagrid. Very bad business. Had to come-- three
attacks on Muggle-borns. Things have gone far enough. The Ministrys got to
act.
HAGRID: Oh, but I never- you know I never, Professor!
DUMBLEDORE: I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full
confidence.
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Albus look, Hagrids record is against him. Ive got to take
him.
HAGRID: Take me? Take me where? Not Azkaban Prison?
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Im afraid we have no choice, Hagrid.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Already here, Fudge? Good...
HAGRID: Whatre you doin here? Get outta my house!
LUCIUS MALFOY: Believe me, I take absolutely no pleasure being inside your--
you call this a house? Huh! No. I simply called at the school, and was told
the headmaster was here.
DUMBLEDORE: Well, what exactly is it that you want with me?
LUCIUS MALFOY: The other governors and I have decided its time for you to
step aside. This is an order of suspension. Youll find all twelve signatures
on it. Im afraid we feel youve rather lost your touch. Well, what, with all
these attacks, therell be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts. I can only
imagine what an awful loss that would be to the school.
HAGRID: Yeh can take Professor Dumbledore away. Take him away, an the
Muggle-borns won stand a chance! You mark my words, therell be killins
next!
LUCIUS MALFOY: You think so?
DUMBLEDORE: Calm yourself, Hagrid. If the governors desire my removal, I
will, of course, step aside. However, you will find that help will always be
given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Admirable sentiments. Shall we? Fudge!
CORNELIUS FUDGE: Come, Hagrid... Well?
HAGRID: Ahem! If, uh, if anybody was looking for some stuff, then all theyd
have to do would be to follow the spiders. Yup! That would lead them right!
Thats all I have to say. Oh, and someonell need to feed Fang while Im
away.
FANG: (Grrr...)

ARAGOG: Hagrid? Is that you?
HARRY: Were friends of Hagrids. And you? Y- y-youre Aragog arent you?
ARAGOG: Yes. Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before.
HARRY: Hes in trouble. Up at the school, there have been attacks. They think
its Hagrid. They think he opened the Chamber of Secrets, like before.
ARAGOG: Thats a lie! Hagrid never opened the Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY: Then youre not the monster.
ARAGOG: No! The monster was born in the castle. I came to Hagrid from a
distant land, in the pocket of a traveler.
RON: Harry.
HARRY: Shush. But if youre not the monster, then- then what did kill that
girl fifty years ago?
ARAGOG: We do not speak of it. It is an ancient creature we spiders fear
above all others.
HARRY: But have you seen it?
ARAGOG: I never saw any part of the castle but the box in which Hagrid kept
me. The girl was discovered in a bathroom. When I was accused, Hagrid brought
me here.
RON: Harry!
HARRY: What?
RON: Ahh- hhh...
----------
Scene 27: Spider attack.
HARRY: Well, thank you. Well just...go.
ARAGOG: Go? I think not. My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid on my
command. But I cannot deny them fresh meat when it wanders so willingly into
our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.
RON: Can we panic now?
RON: Know any spells?
HARRY: One, but its not powerful enough for all of them.
RON: Wheres Hermione when you need her?
HARRY: Lets go! Arania exumai! Go!
HARRY, RON: Whoah!
RON: Glad were out of there. Ah- Aaaah!

HARRY: Come on! Pull!
RON: Im trying!
RON: Follow the spiders! Follow the spiders! If Hagrid ever gets out of
Azkaban, Ill kill him! I mean, what was the point of sending us in there?

innocent.

HARRY: Of the many fearsome beasts that roam our land, none is more deadly
than the basilisk. Capable of living for hundreds of years, instant death
awaits any who meet this giant serpents eye. Spiders flee before it. Ron,
this is it. The monster in the Chamber of Secrets is a basilisk. Thats why I
can hear it speak. Its a snake!
RON: But if it kills by looking people in the eye, why is it no ones dead?
HARRY: Because no one did look it in the eye. Not directly, at least. Colin
saw it through his camera. Justin...Justin must have seen the basilisk
through Nearly Headless Nick. Nick got the full blast of it- but hes a
ghost- he couldnt die again. And Hermione...had the mirror. I bet you
anything she was using it to look around corners, in case it came along.
RON: And Mrs. Norris? Im pretty sure she didnt have a camera or a mirror,
Harry.
HARRY: The water. There was water on the floor that night. She only saw the
basilisks reflection. Spiders flee before it. It all fits!
RON: But hows a basilisk been getting around? A dirty great snake- someone
would have seen it.
HARRY: Hermiones answered that, too.
RON: Pipes? Its using the plumbing!
HARRY: Remember what Aragog said, about that girl fifty years ago? She died
in a bathroom? What if she never left?
RON: Moaning Myrtle.

this is the end of Hogwarts.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: So sorry- dozed off- what have I missed?

come, at last.

in the job description about a-
HARRY: Youre running away? After all that stuff you did in your books?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Books can be misleading!
HARRY: You wrote them!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: My dear boy, do use your common sense! My books wouldnt
have sold half as well if people didnt think Id done all those things!
HARRY: Youre a fraud! Youve just been taking credit for what other wizards
have done!
RON: Is there anything you can do?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Yes, now you mention it. Im rather gifted with Memory
Charms. Otherwise, you see, all those wizards would have gone blabbing. And
Id never have sold another book. In fact, ah...Im ah...going to have to do
the same to you.
HARRY: Dont even think about it.

LOCATION: Hogwarts  Girls bathroom - night
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh! Whos there? Oh! Hello, Harry! Ron. What do you want?
HARRY: To ask you how you died.
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh! It was dreadful. It happened right here in this very
cubicle. Id hidden because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. I
was crying, and then I heard somebody come in.
HARRY: Who was it Myrtle?
MOANING MYRTLE: I dont know. I was Distraught! Huhh-huh...But they said
something funny, a kind of made up language. And I realized it was a boy
speaking, so I unlocked the door to tell him to go away and... I died.
HARRY: Just like that? How?
MOANING MYRTLE: I just remember seeing a pair of great big yellow eyes...over
there, by that sink. Ohhhhooo...
HARRY: This is it. This is it, Ron. I think this is the entrance to the
Chamber of Secrets.
RON: Say something. Harry, say something in Parseltongue!
HARRY: Hesha- Hassah.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Excellent, Harry. Haa! Good work! Well then, Ill just
be, ah... Theres no need for me to stay.
HARRY: Oh, yes there is! You first.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Now, boys what good will it do?
RON: Better you than us.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Um...but...obviously, yes. Sure you dont want to test it
first? No! Aaaah! Its really quite filthy down here.
HARRY: All right. Lets go.
MOANING MYRTLE: Oh, Harry? If you die down there, youre welcome to share my
toilet. Hee, hee.
HARRY: Uh...thanks Myrtle.
HARRY & RON: Aaah!
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts  underground chambers
RON: Ugh!
HARRY: Now remember, any sign of movement, close your eyes straightaway.
RON: Go on.
----------
Scene 30: Backfire.
HARRY: This way.
RON: Whats this?
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: It looks like a... snake.
HARRY: Its a snakeskin.
RON: Bloody hell. Whatever shed this must be sixty feet long-- or more! Heart
of a lion, this one.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: The adventure ends here, boys. But dont fret. The world
will know our story. How I was too late to save the girl. How you two
tragically lost your minds at the sight of her mangled body. So, you first,
Mr. Potter. Say good-bye to your memories. Obliviate!
RON: Harry! Harry!
HARRY: Ron! Ron, are you ok?
RON: Im fine!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Uhh... Hello. Who are you?
RON: Um...Ron Weasley.
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Really? And uh, who- who am I?
RON: Lockharts memory charm backfired. He hasnt got a clue who he is!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Its an odd sort of place this, isnt it? Do you live
here?
RON: No!
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Really? Well-
RON: Whatll do I do now?
HARRY: You wait here and try and shift some of this rock so we can get back
through. Ill go on and find Ginny!
RON: OK.
HARRY: Hesha- Hassah.

Scene 31: Heir of Slytherin.
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts  Chamber of Secrets
HARRY: Ginny... Ginny! Oh, Ginny, please dont be dead. Wake up. Wake up!
Please, wake up!
TOM RIDDLE: She wont wake.
HARRY: Tom. Tom Riddle! What do you mean, she wont wake? Shes not...?
TOM RIDDLE: Shes still alive, but only just.
HARRY: Are you a ghost?
TOM RIDDLE: A memory, preserved in a diary for fifty years.
HARRY: Shes cold as ice. Ginny, please dont be dead. Wake up! Youve got to
help me, Tom. Theres a basilisk.
TOM RIDDLE: It wont come until its called.
HARRY: Give me my wand, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE: You wont be needing it.
HARRY: Listen, weve got to go! Weve got to save her!
TOM RIDDLE: Im afraid I cant do that, Harry. You see, as poor Ginny grows
weaker, I grow stronger. Yes Harry, it was Ginny Weasley who opened the
Chamber of Secrets.
HARRY: No. She couldnt. She wouldnt!
TOM RIDDLE: It was Ginny who set the basilisk on the Mudbloods and Filchs
cat, Ginny who wrote the threatening messages on the walls.
HARRY: But why?
TOM RIDDLE: Because I told her to. Youll find that I can be very persuasive.
Not that she knew what she was doing. She was, shall we say, in a kind of
trance. Still, the power of the diary began to scare her. And she tried to
dispose of it in the girls bathroom. And then, who should find it, but you?
The very person I was most anxious to meet.
HARRY: But, why did you want to meet me?
TOM RIDDLE: I knew I had to talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to
show you my capture of that brainless oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust.
HARRY: Hagrids my friend! And you framed him, didnt you?
TOM RIDDLE: It was my word against Hagrids. Only Dumbledore seemed to think
he was innocent.
HARRY: Ill bet Dumbledore saw right through you.
TOM RIDDLE: He certainly kept an annoyingly close watch on me after that. I
knew it wouldnt be safe to open the Chamber again while I was still at
school, so I decided to leave behind a diary preserving my sixteen-year-old
self in its pages, so that one day I would be able to lead another to finish
Salazar Slytherins noble work.
HARRY: Well, you havent finished it this time. In a few hours, the Mandrake
Draught will be ready, and everyone who was Petrified will be all right
again.
TOM RIDDLE: Havent I told you? Killing Mudbloods doesnt matter to me
anymore. For many months now, my new target... has been you. How is it that a
baby, with no extraordinary magical talent, was able to defeat the greatest
wizard of all time? How did you escape with nothing but a scar, while Lord
Voldemorts powers were destroyed?
HARRY: Why do you care how I escaped? Voldemort was after your time.
TOM RIDDLE: Voldemort is my past, present, and future. (writes in the air)
TOM MARVOLO RIDDLE (rearranges) I AM LORD VOLDEMORT
HARRY: You! Youre the Heir of Slytherin. Youre Voldemort.
TOM RIDDLE: Surely, you didnt think I was going to keep my filthy Muggle
fathers name? No. I fashioned myself a new name, a name I knew wizards
everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I became the greatest sorcerer
in the world.
HARRY: Albus Dumbledore is the greatest sorcerer in the world!
TOM RIDDLE: Dumbledores been driven out of this castle by the mere memory of
me!
HARRY: Hell never be gone! Not as long as those who remain are loyal to him!
Fawkes?
TOM RIDDLE: So, this is what Dumbledore sends his great defender, a songbird
and an old hat. Shearhas- Samnathas- Sélithaeine.
----------
Scene 32: The Basilisk.
TOM RIDDLE: Lets match the power of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar
Slytherin, against the famous Harry Potter. Sethae- He- This. Parseltongue
wont save you now, Potter. It only obeys me!
TOM RIDDLE: No! Your bird may have blinded the basilisk, but it can still
hear you!
TOM RIDDLE: Yes, Potter, the process is nearly complete. In a few minutes
Ginny will be dead, and I will cease to be a memory. Lord Voldemort will
return- very... much... alive!
HARRY: Ginny-
----------
Scene 33: Healing powers.
TOM RIDDLE: Remarkable isnt it, how quickly the venom of the basilisk
penetrates the body? Id guess you have little more than a minute to live.
Youll be with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. Funny, the damage a
silly little book can do... especially in the hands of a silly, little girl.
What are you doing? Stop. No! Ahhhh! Ahhhh! Ahhhh!
HARRY: Ginny...
GINNY: Harry. It was me- but I swear, I didnt mean to! Riddle made me,
and... Harry, youre hurt!
HARRY: Dont worry. Ginny, you need to get yourself out. Follow the Chamber,
and youll find Ron. You were brilliant, Fawkes. I just wasnt quick
enough... Of course! Phoenix tears have healing powers. Thanks! Its alright,
Ginny. Its over. Its just a memory.

LOCATION: Hogwarts  flying up out of chambers - night
PROFESSOR LOCKHART: Amazing! This is just like magic!
----------
Scene 34: Out of the hat.
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts  Dumbledores office - morning
DUMBLEDORE: You both realize, of course, that in the past few hours you have
broken perhaps a dozen school rules?
HARRY, RON: Yes, sir.
DUMBLEDORE: And there is sufficient evidence to have you both expelled.
HARRY, RON: Yes, sir.
DUMBLEDORE: Therefore, it is only fitting, that you both receive Special
Awards for Services to the School.
RON: Thanks, sir!
DUMBLEDORE: And now, Mr. Weasley, if you would, have an owl deliver these
release papers to Azkaban? I believe we- we want our gamekeeper back.
Harry... first, I want to thank you, Harry. You must have shown me real
loyalty down in the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to
you. And, um... second, I sense that something is troubling you. Am I right,
Harry?
HARRY: Its just... You see, sir I- I couldnt help but notice certain
things, certain- certain similarities, between Tom Riddle and me.
DUMBLEDORE: I see. Well, you can speak Parseltongue, Harry. Why? Because Lord
Voldemort can speak Parseltongue. If Im not mistaken, Harry, he transferred
some of his powers to you the night he gave you that scar.
HARRY: Voldemort transferred some of his powers... to me?
DUMBLEDORE: Not intentionally, but yes.
HARRY: So the Sorting Hat was right! I should be in Slytherin.
DUMBLEDORE: Its true, Harry. You possess many of the qualities that
Voldemort himself prizes. Determination, resourcefulness, and if I may say
so, a certain disregard for the rules. Why then did the Sorting Hat place you
in Gryffindor?
HARRY: Because I asked it to.
DUMBLEDORE: Exactly, Harry! Exactly! Which makes you different from
Voldemort. It is not our abilities that show what we truly are. It is our
choices. If you want proof why you belong in Gryffindor, then I suggest that
you look more closely at this. Be careful.
HARRY: Godric Gryffindor.
DUMBLEDORE: Ah- it would take a true Gryffindor to pull that out of the hat.
----------
Scene 35: Dobbys reward.
HARRY: Dobby! So this is your master! The family you serve is the Malfoys.
DOBBY: Um-humm...
LUCIUS MALFOY: Ill deal with you later. Out of my way, Potter! So, its
true-- you have returned!
DUMBLEDORE: When the governors learned that Arthur Weasleys daughter was
taken into the Chamber, they saw fit to summon me back.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Ridiculous!
DUMBLEDORE: Curiously, Lucius, several of them were under the impression that
you would curse their families, if they did not agree to suspend me in the
first place.
LUCIUS MALFOY: How dare you?!
DUMBLEDORE: I beg your pardon?
LUCIUS MALFOY: My sole concern has always been, and will always be, the
welfare of this school and, of course, its students. The culprit has been
identified, I presume?
DUMBLEDORE: Oh, yes.
LUCIUS MALFOY: And? Who was it?
DUMBLEDORE: Voldemort.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Ah!
DUMBLEDORE: Only, this time, he chose to act through somebody else, by means
of this.
LUCIUS MALFOY: I see.
DUMBLEDORE: Fortunately, our young Mr. Potter discovered it. One hopes that
no more of Lord Voldemorts old school things should find their way into
innocent hands. The consequences for the one responsible would be severe.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Well, let us hope that Mr. Potter will always be around to
save the day.
HARRY: Dont worry. I will be.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Dumbledore. Come, Dobby. Were leaving.
DOBBY: Ahh! Oow!
HARRY: Sir, I wonder if I could have that?
----------
LOCATION: Hogwarts - hallway - daytime
HARRY: Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! I have something of yours.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Mine? I dont know what youre talking about.
HARRY: Oh, I think you do, sir. I think you slipped the diary into Ginny
Weasleys cauldron, that day at Diagon Alley.
LUCIUS MALFOY: You do, do you? Why dont you prove it? Come, Dobby.
Dobby!
HARRY: Open it.
LUCIUS MALFOY: Dobby?
DOBBY: Master has given Dobby a sock!
LUCIUS MALFOY: What? I didnt give-
DOBBY: Master has presented Dobby with clothes! Dobby is free!
LUCIUS MALFOY: Youve lost me my servant!
DOBBY: You shall not harm Harry Potter!
LUCIUS MALFOY: Advada-
LUCIUS MALFOY: Your parents were meddlesome fools, too. You mark my words,
Potter, one day soon you are going to meet the same sticky end!
DOBBY: Harry Potter freed Dobby! How can Dobby ever repay him?
HARRY: Just promise me something.
DOBBY: Anything, sir!
HARRY: Never try to save my life again.

HERMIONE: Its good to be back! Congratulations! I cant believe you solved

HARRY: Well, we had loads of help from you. We couldnt have done it without
you.
HERMIONE: Thanks.
PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL: Could I have your attention, please?
DUMBLEDORE: Before we begin the feast, let us have a round of applause for
Professor Sprout and Madame Pomfrey, whose Mandrake juice has been so
successfully administered to all who had been Petrified. Also, in light of
the recent events, as a school treat, all exams have been canceled.
HERMIONE: Oh, no!
HAGRID: Sorry Im late! The owl that delivered my release papers got all lost
and confused. Some ruddy bird called Errol. And Id just like to say that a-
if it hadnt been for you, Harry, and Ron, and Hermione, o course, I would-
uh- Id still be you-know-where, so I- Id just like to say Thanks.

HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN
by
Steve Kloves
Based on the book by
J.K. Rowling
FULL TAN DRAFT
February 24, 2003
 FADE IN:
1 EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 1
The street slumbers, adrift in shadow. Then... a curious BEAM OF LIGHT BOBS beyond the second-story window of Number Four.
2 INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 2
A tent of blankets. Within... the SHADOW of a BOY. A WHISPER:
HARRY: Lumos Maxima...
The tent BLOOMS SOFTLY with light -- briefly illuminating a bedside PHOTOGRAPH (of James & Lily Potter) -- then goes dark.
HARRY: Lumos Maxima...
The blankets bloom once again when, down the hall, a TOILET FLUSHES. Instantly, the SHADOW stiffens, the blankets DIM, and the tent flattens.
Just as...... the bedroom door OPENS, revealing... UNCLE VERNON.
He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then...
withdraws.
The tent rises.
HARRY: Lumos Maxima...
As the blankets blaze, we CUT INSIDE, find a SKINNY BOY with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting
crookedly atop his nose: HARRY POTTER. Open before him is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. Once again, he speaks:
HARRY: Lumos... MAXIMA!
2A EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 2A
A BLINDING BLAST OF LIGHT FLASHES from the second story
window of Number Four. DOGS BARK. And a TITLE CARD
appears:
HARRY POTTER
and the
Prisoner of Azkaban
3.
2B INT. HARRY'S ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 2B
The light in the hallway SNAPS on, Harry's tent droops
once more and, seconds later, Harry's door eases open.
Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light. The
room is utterly SILENT. Slowly, he closes the door.

6 INT. FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - STAIRWAY/FRONT HALL - DAY 6
The DOORBELL CHIMES and a shrill VOICE THUNDERS:
AUNT PETUNIA (O.S.)
Harry!
Harry!
Harry bounds down the stairs and into the front hall,
where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly.
Petunia flicks a bit of fluff from Dudley's sweater,
glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the
door.
AUNT PETUNIA
Well, go on. Open it.
Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS
OPEN, revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and
a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle Vernon lurches
forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in
hand, and drops it on Harry.
AUNT PETUNIA
Marge! Welcome! How was the
train?
AUNT MARGE
Wretched. Ripper got sick.
AUNT PETUNIA
Ah. How... unfortunate.
 AUNT MARGE
I would've left him with the
others, but he pines so when I'm
away. Don't you, darling?
Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down
the hallway. Harry follows with Uncle Vernon.
(CONTINUED)
4.
6 CONTINUED: 6
HARRY
Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign
this form.
UNCLE VERNON
What is it?
HARRY
Nothing. Something for school...
Uncle Vernon eyes the PARCHMENT in Harry's hand
suspiciously.
UNCLE VERNON
Later perhaps. If you behave.
HARRY
I will if she does.
AUNT MARGE
(turning, eyeing Harry)
So. Still here, are you?
HARRY
Yes.
AUNT MARGE
Don't say 'yes' in that ungrateful
tone. Damn good of my brother to
keep you, if you ask me.
(to Vernon, Petunia)
It'd have been straight to an
orphanage if he'd been dumped on
 my doorstep.
Just then Dudley -- sitting comatose before the TV --
emits a HOLLOW, BRAIN-DEAD CHUCKLE.
AUNT MARGE
Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that
my neffy poo? Come and say hello
to your Auntie Marge.
Marge flashes a thick FAN of POUND NOTES. Dudley blinks,
waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently.
Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his
ankle.
7 INT. FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DINING ROOM - DUSK 7
As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a
bottle of brandy.
(CONTINUED)
5.
7 CONTINUED: 7
UNCLE VERNON
Can I tempt you, Marge?
AUNT MARGE
Just a small one. A bit more... a
bit more... That's the boy.
(taking a
sloppy sip)
Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia.
It's normally just a fry-up for
me, what with twelve dogs.
She smacks her lips, lowers her brandy, and lets Ripper
take a slobbery lap out of the glass... then catches
Harry looking.
AUNT MARGE
What are you smirking at! Where
is it that you send him, Vernon?
UNCLE VERNON
St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate
institution for hopeless cases.
Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who
glares darkly at him.
AUNT MARGE
I see. And do they use the cane
at St. Brutus's, boy?
HARRY
(sarcastically)
Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads
of times.
AUNT MARGE
Excellent. I won't have this
namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense
about not hitting people who
deserve it.
(another sip)
Still. Mustn't blame yourself for
how this one's turned out, Vernon.
It all comes down to blood. Bad
blood will out. What is it the
boy's father did, Petunia?
AUNT PETUNIA
(agitated)
Nothing. That is... he didn't
work. He was -- unemployed.
(CONTINUED)
6.
7 CONTINUED: (2) 7
AUNT MARGE
Of course. And a drunk,
I expect --
HARRY
That's a lie.
Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry.
AUNT MARGE
What did you say?
HARRY
My dad wasn't a drunk.
POP! The GLASS in Aunt Marge's hand EXPLODES.
AUNT PETUNIA
Oh my goodness! Marge!
AUNT MARGE
Not to worry, Petunia. I have a
very firm grip.
Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise.
UNCLE VERNON
You go to bed. Now.
AUNT MARGE
Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter
about the father. In the end it
comes down to the mother. You see
it all the time with dogs. If
there's something wrong with the
bitch, there'll be something wrong
with the pup...
HARRY
Shut up! Shut up!
Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- ZING! -- a BUTTON on
her dress sails into the air. SEAMS GROAN. THREAD
SNAPS. Aunt Marge's eyes WIDEN. Her cheeks BILLOW. Her
whole body BILLOWS. And she begins to INFLATE like a
MONSTROUS BALLOON.
UNCLE VERNON
MARGE!
As she rises, Uncle Vernon leaps for her. RIPPER GROWLS,
fixes his teeth to his trousers. Harry frightened by
what he's done, watches Aunt Marge BOUNCE GENTLY across
the ceiling and into the CONSERVATORY.
7.
7A EXT. BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 7A
The others race outside. As Aunt Marge begins to float
away, Uncle Vernon grips her hands.
UNCLE VERNON
Don't worry! I've got you...
Slowly... to his horror... Uncle Vernon himself begins to
RISE. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes...
AUNT MARGE
Vernon. Don't you dare --
But he does. He lets go. Falls to his knees. And
watches Aunt Marge float away.
8 INT. HARRY'S ROOM - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 8
Harry crashes inside, takes his TRUNK, then puts his heel
to a LOOSE FLOORBOARD and removes his WAND from its
hiding place. Turning, he grabs the PHOTOGRAPH of his
parents.
9 INT. HALLWAY - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 9
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the TRUNK down the
stairs... finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him.
UNCLE VERNON
YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER
BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT!
HARRY
No! She deserved what she got!
And you... you keep away from me.
Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with
knowing cruelty.
UNCLE VERNON
You're not allowed to do magic out
of school. They won't have you
now. You've got nowhere to go.
Harry realizes it's true. Briefly falters. Then:
HARRY
Anywhere's better than here.
9A EXT. NUMBER FOUR PRIVET DRIVE - DUSK (SECONDS LATER) 9A
As Harry storms out with his trunk, we DOLLY TO the
street WITH him. High in the sky, a plump DOT rises.
Aunt Marge.
8.
10 EXT. MAGNOLIA CRESCENT - NIGHT (LATER) 10
Harry walks and walks and walks, then... stops. Glances
about. An empty PLAYGROUND. SWINGS CREAKING gently on
rusted chains. A tiny CAROUSEL, kissed gently by the
wind, turning slowly.
Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Deep in the night, an
ALARM SHRIEKS, goes SILENT. Harry, still as a statue.
Listening. In the trees above, LEAVES TREMBLE. The WIND
gathers.
Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.
Then, he... stiffens. Turns back. Sensing something in
the shadows across the street, he rises. Slowly draws
his wand.
Then he sees... it. Something BIG. Darker than the
shadows which conceal it. Something with WIDE, GLEAMING
EYES.
Harry steps back. Afraid to look. Afraid not to. Wand
 outstretched... he TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten
trunk. The tip of his wand BLAZES.
BANG! TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night.
HARRY
Aaaah!
GIANT WHEELS bear down. Harry rolls clear -- just as a
PREPOSTEROUSLY PURPLE, TRIPLE-DECKER BUS SCREECHES to a
halt. GOLD LETTERS glimmer above the windscreen: The
Knight Bus.
DOORS HISS. Snap back. REVEAL STAN SHUNPIKE, an 18-
year-old boy in a WRINKLED CONDUCTOR'S UNIFORM. Pasty
face. Raccoon eyes. Stan looks like he hasn't seen the
sun in years.
STAN SHUNPIKE
(wearily, drearily)
Welcome to the Knight Bus.
Emergency transport for the
stranded witch or wizard. My name
is Stan Shunpike, and I will be
your conductor this evening.
(peering at Harry)
Wha' choo doin' down there?
HARRY
Fell over.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Wha' choo fall over for?
(CONTINUED)
9.
10 CONTINUED: 10
HARRY
I didn't do it on purpose.
Stan eyes Harry suspiciously, nods slowly.
 STAN SHUNPIKE
Well, come on then. Let's not
wait for the grass to grow.
As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows
across the street -- now simply shadows -- and climbs
aboard.
11 INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 11
No seats. Only BEDS. The BRASS frames need a shine, the
lines a wash. In one bed, a DISHEVELED WIZARD GRUNTS,
turns over in his sleep.
DISHEVELED WIZARD
Not now... I'm pickling slugs...
Behind the wheel, ERNIE, an UNSHAVEN WIZARD in THICK
GLASSES, stares straight ahead, armpits stained with
sweat. A SHRUNKEN HEAD dangles from the rearview mirror,
MUTTERING incessantly through the STITCHES that lace its
mouth.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Take 'er away, Ern.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Yeah, take it away!
BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as one -- slide
six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed
nearest, peers up at the CHANDELIER SWAYING directly
above his head. Beyond the windscreen ONCOMING TRAFFIC
WHIPS past in a blur.
STAN SHUNPIKE
Wot you say your name was again?
HARRY
I didn't.
Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily
Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once
more. Harry brushes the fringe of his hair over his
scar, watches an AMBULANCE -- SIREN WAILING -- careen
past.
(CONTINUED)
10.
11 CONTINUED: 11
STAN SHUNPIKE
Whereabouts you headin'?
Harry hesitates. He hadn't thought about this. Decides.
HARRY
The Leaky Cauldron. That's in
London --
STAN SHUNPIKE
Is it now? Get that, Ern? The
Leaky Cauldron. That's in London.
Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from
the pea soup!
As the Shrunken Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peers
out the windscreen, watches London careering by.
HARRY
Isn't this a bit... dangerous?
STAN SHUNPIKE
Naah. Haven't had an accident
in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern?
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Heads up! Little old lady at
twelve o'clock!
Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is
crossing the street. Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and
Harry flies forward, palms to the window. The brakes
pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and
Harry flies back onto his bed. BANG! The bus rockets
forward once more.
As Harry rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of
Stan's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a
sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a
MOVING PHOTOGRAPH.
 HARRY
Who is that? That man.
STAN SHUNPIKE

Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face.
STAN SHUNPIKE
A murderer, he is. Got 'imself
locked up in Azkaban for it.
HARRY
How'd he escape?
STAN SHUNPIKE
Tha's the question, isn't it?
He's the firs' that's done it.
Gives me the collywobbles thinking
he's out there, though, I'll tell
you that. Big supporter of You-
Know-'Oo, Black was. Reckon you
heard o' him.
Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift. Meet
Harry's.
HARRY
Yeah. Him I've heard of.
Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep directly
toward the Knight Bus. Before can scream, the entire
Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and shoots the gap between the
two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Hate that.
HARRY
This bus. Don't the Muggles ever...
STAN SHUNPIKE
Them! Don' listen properly, do
they? Don' look properly either.
Never notice nuffink, they don'.
Just then, a COUPLE walking a DOG are engulfed by a RUSH
of WIND as the (invisible) Knight Bus WHOOSHES past. The
couple glances about in bewilderment. The DOG YAPS
madly.
SHRUNKEN HEAD
Turn! Turn!
Ernie fans the wheel, sending the Knight Bus into a
dizzying 360-degree turn. HEADLIGHTS pinwheel past the
windows as the bus rides up on two wheels and Harry is
sent flying once more. Grabbing fast to the center POLE,
he pirouettes through the air when Ernie... SLAMS on the
BRAKES.

12 EXT. CHARING CROSS ROAD/LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT 12
The Knight Bus fishtails INTO VIEW and SQUEALS to a stop,
centimeters from a PARKED CAR. WHOOSH! The bus settles
and -- TINK! -- taps the bumper. Instantly, the car's
ALARM wails.
12A INT. THE KNIGHT BUS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 12A
The chandelier sways drunkenly as the bus doors open.
The steps GROAN with heavy feet and a FIGURE appears:
TOM, Innkeeper of the Leaky Cauldron pub.
TOM
Mr. Potter... at last.
12B EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 12B
As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are
revealed, Harry glances up, reads the SIGN above: THE
LEAKY CAULDRON. Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then
pauses and, with a FLICK of his wand, silences the car
alarm.
13 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BAR/HALLWAY - NIGHT (MOMENTS 13
LATER)
Harry trails Tom through the quiet room. The BARTENDER
glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A
solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his
COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF. Tom leads Harry upstairs.
14 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - BACK ROOM - NIGHT 14
As Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a SNOW WHITE OWL
(HEDWIG) perched atop a chair.
HARRY
Hedwig!
TOM
Right smart bird you've got there,
Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes
before yourself.
A MAN CLEARS his throat. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED
SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE) at the window, staring at
the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers
in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a
position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from
his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his
palms.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
I should tell you, Mr. Potter,
earlier this evening your uncle's
sister was located just south of
Sheffield, circling a chimney
stack. The Accidental Magic
Reversal Department was dispatched
and she's been properly punctured
and
her memory modified. She has no
recollection of the incident
whatsoever.
Harry waits. A man condemned. Then Fudge turns.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
So that's that, and no harm done.
(smiling)
Pea soup?
Harry glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to
Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum, frees a walnut
sliver.
HARRY
No thank you. Minister... I don't
understand. I broke the law.
Underage wizards aren't allowed to
use magic at home --
CORNELIUS FUDGE
(dishing up a bowl)
Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry
doesn't send people to Azkaban for
blowing up their aunts! On the
other hand... running away like
that... given the state of
things... very, very
irresponsible.
HARRY
'The state of things' sir?
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.
HARRY
Sirius Black, you mean. But...
what's that got to do with me?
CRACK! Tom SHATTERS another WALNUT. Fudge smiles
nervously.

CORNELIUS FUDGE
Hm? Oh, nothing. You're safe,
that's what matters. Tomorrow
you'll be on your way to Hogwarts.
These are your new schoolbooks.
I took the liberty of having them
brought here for you.
Harry eyes the STACK of BOOKS. One is bound by a ROPE.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
By the way, Harry. Whilst you're
here it would be best if you
didn't... wander.

16 EXT. LEAKY CAULDRON - ROOM ELEVEN - MORNING 16
THROUGH the window: the rooftops of London. A TRAIN
PASSES and CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Harry, standing
with Hedwig. He turns, eyes his schoolbooks. He studies
the GROWLING TOME -- The Monster Book of Monsters -- then
gives the rope a tug. Instantly...
... the book LEAPS to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers
SNAPPING. Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins
 NIPPING viciously at his shoes. Harry vaults atop the
bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a
PILLOW.
Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry
POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled
beneath the pillow. Harry takes the ROPE, prepares to
rebind it.
17 INT. LEAKY CAULDRON - HALLWAY/ROOM ELEVEN - MORNING 17
A YOUNG WITCH in maid's robes pushes a cart down the
hall. Harry exits his room as the witch KNOCKS on a
door.
YOUNG WITCH
Housekeeping.
As she opens the door, she's greeted by a THUNDEROUS ROAR
and a RUSH of WIND.
YOUNG WITCH
(unperturbed)
I'll come back later.

RON (O.S.)
I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep
that bloody beast of yours away
from Scabbers or I'll turn it into
a tea cozy.
HERMIONE (O.S.)
He's a cat, Ronald! What do you
expect? It's in his nature.
As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY
protectively cradling Scabbers, while HERMIONE GRANDER
does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks.
RON
A cat! Is that what they told
you? Looks more like a pig with
hair if you ask me.
HERMIONE
That's rich coming from the owner
of that smelly old shoe brush.
(cooing to the cat)
It's all right, Crookshanks. You
just ignore the mean little boy...
Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn.
HERMIONE/RON

As Ron smoothes the dog-eared clipping onto the table,
Harry studies it. Hermione ignores it, stroking
Crookshanks.
HARRY
Egypt! What's it like?
RON
Brilliant. It's got loads of old
stuff. Mummies. Death masks.
Tombs --
HERMIONE
You know, the ancient Egyptians of
the Nile River delta worshipped
the cat goddess Bast.
Ron glares stonily at Hermione, then turns back to Harry.
RON
I also got a new wand.
Just then, a COMMOTION is HEARD. The Weasleys -- PERCY,
FRED, GEORGE, GINNY, ARTHUR, and MOLLY -- arrive en
masse, laden with purchases from Diagon Alley.
GEORGE
Not flashing that clipping about
again, are you, Ron?
RON
I haven't shown anyone!
FRED
No, not a soul. Unless you count
Tom. The day maid. The night
maid. The cook. The bloke that
came to fix the toilet. That
wizard from Belgium...
Mrs. Weasley takes Harry's face in her hands, smiles. As
if relieved to see him.
MRS. WEASLEY
It's good to see you, Harry.
(CONTINUED)

23A CONTINUED: 23A
HARRY
Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. I wonder if I might have a
word.
HARRY
Of course, Mr. Weasley.
As Mr. Weasley pulls Harry away, the others continue to
hover over the clipping in the b.g.
FRED
George's nose looks positively
massive in that photograph.
GINNY
That's your nose, Fred.
FRED
Bloody hell. 'Tis, isn't it?
Take after your side of the
family, don't I, Mum?
Harry notices Mr. Weasley glance edgily at a FUGITIVE
POSTER tacked to the wall. In it, SIRIUS BLACK glowers
under the words, "Have You Seen This Man?"
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. There are some within the
Ministry who would strongly
discourage me from divulging what
I'm about to tell you. But I
think you need to know the facts.
Because you're in danger. Grave
danger.
Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster.
HARRY
Has this anything to do with him,
sir?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
What do you know of Sirius Black,
Harry?
HARRY
That he escaped from Azkaban.
That he killed someone...

Harry, thirteen years ago, when
you stopped...
Mr. Weasley hesitates, unable to continue.
HARRY
Voldemort...?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
(nodding nervously)
Black lost everything. But he
remains a loyal servant to this
day. In his mind, only you stand
in the way of...
Once again, Mr. Weasley hesitates.
HARRY
Voldemort...?
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry, I hate it when you say --
HARRY
I know, sorry. Ron hates it too.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
In Black's mind, only you stand in
the way of... You-Know-Who
returning to power. That's why
he's broken. That's why he's
broken out of Azkaban. To find
you. And...
Mr. Weasley hesitates yet again.
HARRY
Kill me?
Mr. Weasley nods. Nervously.
ARTHUR WEASLEY
Harry. I want you to swear
that -- whatever you might hear --
you won't go looking for Black.
HARRY
Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking
for someone who wants to kill me?
Mr. Weasley nods, then claps Harry on the shoulder.

window.
MRS. WEASLEY

She hands Scabbers through the open window to him.
27 INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - TRAIN CAR - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 27
The aisle teems with students. Harry, Ron and Hermione
work their way down the aisle, looking for an empty
compartment.
 HARRY
I didn't mean to blow her up. I
just...
(troubled by
the memory)
... lost control.
RON
Brilliant!
HERMIONE
Honestly, Ron, it's not funny.
Harry's lucky he wasn't expelled.
RON
I still think it was brilliant.
SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! A copy of the The Monster Book of
Monsters SCUTTLES CRAB-LIKE down the aisle, pursued by
NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM.
NEVILLE

Hi, Neville.
As he bumps past, Hermione nods to a compartment.
HERMIONE
C'mon. We're in here.
28 INT. TRAIN COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY 28
As they slip inside, they find a MAN in SHABBY ROBES
(PROFESSOR LUPIN) slumped against the window, asleep. He
looks ill, exhausted. The trio eye him warily. WHISPER.
RON
Who d'you reckon he is?
HERMIONE
Professor R.J. Lupin.
RON
You know everything. How is it
she knows everything?
HERMIONE
It's on his case.
She points. Stamped in peeling letters on a BATTERED
CASE is "Professor R.J. Lupin."
HARRY
Is he really asleep?
HERMIONE
Seems to be. Why? What is it,
Harry?
HARRY
Close the door.
Hermione and Ron exchange a curious glance, then Ron
rises, slides the door shut, OVER CAMERA, and we --

Ron and Hermione stare at Harry, faces stricken in the
lantern light that now glows in the compartment.
Crookshanks slumbers in his CAGE.
RON
Let me get this straight. Sirius
Black escaped from Azkaban to come
after you?
HARRY
Yes.
HERMIONE
But they'll catch Black, won't
they? I mean... eventually?
RON
Sure -- Of course, no one's ever
broken out of Azkaban before and
he's a raving, murderous
lunatic...
Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES. Lanterns flicker.
The train LURCHES, begins to SLOW. Hermione slides down
the seat, pinning Ron against the window. They exchange
an awkward glance, then Hermione carefully slides to the
other end of the seat and glances at her WATCH. Frowns.
HERMIONE
Why're we stopping? We can't be
there yet...
Harry rises, slides open the door, peers into the
corridor.
HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out
curiously. Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS --
and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and...

A thin WISP of STEAM escapes Ron's mouth. Harry notices.
HARRY
Dunno... Maybe we've broken down?
HERMIONE
Ouch! Ron, that was my foot!
SQUEAK-SQUEAK-SQUEAK. Ron, a dark silhouette against the
window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window.
RON
There's something moving out
there. I think... people are
coming aboard.
Suddenly the CAR SWAYS violently... rights itself. The
METAL WINDOW TRIM at Ron's fingertips begins to VIBRATE.
RON
Bloody hell. What's happening?
SSSSST! A soft CRACKLING fills the car and FLAMES
bloom... in the hands of R.J. Lupin. In the SHIVERING
LIGHT, his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are
alert. Wary.
 PROFESSOR LUPIN
Don't. Move.
A HAND -- slimy and scabbed -- a hand of death -- GRIPS
the half-open compartment door, pushes it aside.
REVEALS: a TOWERING, CLOAKED FIGURE, its face hidden
beneath its black hood. CROOKSHANKS' hair rises and as
she HISSES...
WHOOSHHHHH. The folds of the hood TREMBLE. A CHILL,
RATTLING INTAKE OF AIR is heard. The FLAMES in Lupin's
hands SPUTTER. A SOUND SWELLS in Harry's ears. Eerie.
Painful. The sound of a WOMAN SCREAMING. Harry's eyes
roll up, eyelids fluttering.
And then... a SILVERY WHITE LIGHT drifts from his mouth.
The world spins off its axis and Harry falls... glasses
tumbling hard to the ground... then Harry... the muscles
of his jaw twitching. THUNDER CRACKS. LIGHTNING paints
the ICY windows...

With a DESPERATE GASP, Harry opens his eyes. Blinks.
DUSK IS GONE. The windows BLACK. The floor at his spine
is SHAKING GENTLY. The train moving again. His eyes
shift, see a DROP OF WATER, newly unfrozen, running
slowly down the window.
HERMIONE
Harry? Harry, are you all right?
Hermione's troubled face hovers above him. He nods.
Sits up. Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand.
Harry's glasses.
 HARRY
Thanks.
Harry slips them on. Discovers the cold sweat glazing
his brow. SNAP! Professor Lupin breaks a ragged
triangle of CHOCOLATE off the SLAB in his hands. Holds
it out.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Chocolate. Eat. It'll help.
HARRY
What was that -- that thing?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Dementor. One of the guards of
Azkaban. It's gone now.
Harry frowns in confusion.
HERMIONE
It was searching the train, Harry.
For Sirius Black.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I need to have a word with the
driver. Excuse me.

never be cheerful again. But...
no.
Harry turns to Hermione. She shakes her head.
HERMIONE
I was trembling. Cold. But

HARRY
But someone was screaming. A

At the High Table, Lupin sits with SEVERUS SNAPE, MINERVA
McGONAGALL, RUBEUS HAGRID and ALBUS DUMBLEDORE. We TRACK

HARPSICHORD, and LAND ON a QUINTET OF TOADS (one of
which -- TREVOR -- belongs to NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM, who
looks on with pride).
ARGUS FILCH, Hogwarts' caretaker, stands grimly to the
side as red-eyed MRS. NORRIS switches her tail at his
feet. As the choir's song concludes, DUMBLEDORE rises,
beaming over the sea of black hats.
DUMBLEDORE
Welcome! Welcome to another year
at Hogwarts! I have a few things
to say, before we become befuddled
by our excellent feast. I myself
am particularly looking forward to
the flaming kiwi cups, which,
while somewhat treacherous for
those of us with facial hair...
McGONAGALL clears her throat.
DUMBLEDORE
Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to
welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who
has kindly consented to fill the
post of Defense Against the Dark
Arts. Good luck to you,
Professor.
Amid SCATTERED APPLAUSE, Harry, Ron, Hermione CLAP
LOUDLY.
HERMIONE
 Of course! That's why he knew to
give you the chocolate, Harry.
DUMBLEDORE
As some of you may know, Professor
Kettleburn, our Care of Magical
Creatures teacher for many years,
has decided to retire in order to
spend more time with his remaining
limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted
to announce that his place will be
filled by none other than our own
Rubeus Hagrid!

water goblets weaving.
DUMBLEDORE
(turning grave)
Finally, on a more disquieting
note, Hogwarts -- at the request
of the Ministry of Magic -- will,
until further notice, play host to
the Dementors of Azkaban.
A MURMUR of apprehension fills the hall. At the
Slytherin table, DRACO MALFOY, flanked by the ever-
present CRABBE and GOYLE, catches Harry's eye, feigns
a dead faint.
DUMBLEDORE
The Dementors will be stationed at
the entrances to the grounds. While
they are under strict orders not to
enter the castle itself, you will on
occasion see them as you go about
your daily activities. Under no
 circumstances are you to approach
them. It is not in the nature of
a Dementor to be forgiving.

BIRDBATH, finally coming to rest upon...

discipline. Now Ancient Runes.
That's a fascinating subject.
RON
Ancient Runes? Exactly how many
classes are you taking this term?
HERMIONE
A fair few.
RON
Hang on. Ancient Runes is the
same time as Divination. You'd
have to be in two classes at once.
HERMIONE
Don't be silly. How could anyone
be in two classes at once?
(mimicking Trelawney)
Broaden your minds...
43A EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 43A
STUDENTS gather around Hagrid as Harry, Ron and Hermione
arrive. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stand with the
Slytherins.
HAGRID
C'mon now, get a move on! Got a
real treat for yeh. Great lesson
comin' up. Follow me.
44 EXT. PADDOCK - HAGRID'S HUT - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 44
Hagrid leads them toward a small paddock just this side
of the Forbidden Forest. In the paddock, a freestanding
IRON RACK hangs with DEAD FERRETS, BUZZING with FLIES.
Nearby is a PUMPKIN PATCH.
HAGRID
Gather 'round. Find yerself a spot.
That's it. Now, firs' thing yeh'll
want ter do is open yer books --
DRACO
And exactly how do we do that?
(CONTINUED)
32.
44 CONTINUED: 44
Hagrid looks. Belts, rope, Spellotape: any means
available have been employed to bridle The Monster Book
of Monsters, which QUIVER VIOLENTLY.
HAGRID
Crikey. Didn' yeh know? All yeh've
got ter do is stroke 'em. Look --
Hagrid takes Hermione's copy, SNAPS the Spellotape
binding it. As it begins to BITE, Hagrid calmly runs a
forefinger down the book's spine and it... SHIVERS.
Falls quietly open.
Hagrid glances at the class, looking suddenly unsure.
HAGRID
Righ' then. So... so... yeh've
got yer books, an' now yeh need
the Magical Creatures. Right.
So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em.
Hagrid turns, disappears into the trees. Draco shakes
his head, SPEAKS LOUDLY to Crabbe and Goyle.
DRACO
 God, this place is going to the
dogs. Wait until my father hears
Dumbledore's got this oaf teaching
classes.
HARRY
Listen, you stupid prat --
Eyes WIDENING in fear, Malfoy steps back, points.
DRACO
Potter, there's a Dementor behind
you.
Harry JUMPS, wheels in fear, finds... nothing. Instantly,
the SLYTHERINS make an eerie OOH... and OOH sound, then
break up laughing. Harry reddens, embarrassed, then...
A STRANGE BEAST (BUCKBEAK) emerges from the trees. It
has the torso, hind legs, and tail of a horse, but the
front legs, wings and head of a giant eagle. The
students step back in fear, then Hagrid appears, shooing
the beast on.
HAGRID
Gee up, there!
(grinning)
Beau'iful, isn' he?
(CONTINUED)
33.
44 CONTINUED: (2) 44
There seems no consensus on this, but the students stare
in wary wonder nonetheless. As Hagrid coaxes the beast
to the center of the paddock, Ron stares uneasily.
RON
Hagrid. Exactly what is that?
HAGRID
A Hippogriff, o' course. Now,
firs' thing yeh gotta know is
 they're proud. Easily offended,
Hippogriffs are. Don't never
insult one, 'cause it migh' be
the las' thing yeh do. Right
then -- who wants ter come an'
say hello?
The entire class STEPS BACK, leaving Harry in front.
HAGRID
Good man, Harry!
Harry looks around, then -- reluctantly -- approaches.
HAGRID
Tha's it. Easy now... stop! This
here's Buckbeak, Harry. Yeh want
ter let 'im make the firs' move.
It's polite, see? Jus' take step
forward, give 'im a bow, and if
Buckbeak bows back, yeh're allowed
ter touch him. Ready?
Unsure, Harry nods anyway. Steps forward. And... bows.
Buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying Harry cannily.
Harry waits. And waits...
HAGRID
Back off, Harry! Back off!
Harry starts to step back, when... Buckbeak ducks his
beak. Hagrid sighs, relieved.
HAGRID
Well done, Harry! Go on. Give
'im a pat.
Tentatively, Harry reaches out, lays his hand on
Buckbeak's fierce beak. The class CLAPS. Harry
smiles.
(CONTINUED)
34.
44 CONTINUED: (3) 44
HAGRID
Look at that! I reckon he migh'
 let yeh ride 'im!
HARRY
(smile drooping)
Excuse me?
HAGRID
We'll jus' set yeh behind the
wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull
any feathers out. He won' like
that.
Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak's
back, and before Harry's settled, SLAPS Buckbeak's
hindquarters.
HAGRID
Off yeh go!
As Buckbeak GALLOPS FORWARD, Harry slides scarily back,
giant WINGS unfold, huge and powerful, and -- WHOOSH! --
they SOAR into the air. Rising higher. And higher.
And higher.
Gradually, Harry loosens his hold on Buckbeak's neck.
Losing himself in the joy of flying. Smiling at the
sight of his and Buckbeak's SHADOW racing across the
grass below. Circling over the Whomping Willow, past
Hogwarts castle, and then SWOOPING, with heart-stopping
speed, over the Black Lake, Buckbeak's talons tickling
the smooth glass of the water, summoning the GIANT SQUID
to the surface briefly. Hagrid WHISTLES then, and
Buckbeak wheels, beating his way back to the paddock,
galloping to a halt. As Harry slides off, the class
CHEERS -- all except Draco, who narrows his eyes
maliciously.
HAGRID
Good work, Harry!
(under his breath)
How'm I doin' me firs' day?
HARRY
Brilliant... Professor.
They both grin, when Draco pushes past them roughly,
strides toward Buckbeak.
(CONTINUED)
35.
44 CONTINUED: (4) 44
DRACO
Give me a go at that thing. If
Potter can do it, it must be
easy. You're not dangerous at
all, are you, you great ugly
brute --
HAGRID
Malfoy! No!
In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN. Malfoy
freezes. Looks down at the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on his
robes. SHRIEKS. Instantly, Harry dashes forward.
Buckbeak WHIPS AROUND, raises its talons and -- seeing
Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Harry...
realizing what he's done... breathes.
DRACO
It's killed me! It's killed
me!
HAGRID
Calm yerself! Yer fine... jus'
a scratch...
Hagrid looks: a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp
arm.
HERMIONE
Hagrid. He's got to be taken to
a hospital. I'll go with you,
if you like --
HAGRID
No. I'm the teacher. You all...
you all just... Class dismissed!
And with that, Hagrid -- looking shaken -- swoops up
Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers
toward the castle.
45 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 45
As Lavender and Parvati huddle over a DOZEN TEACUPS,
Avidly interpreting patterns in HUSHED VOICES, Draco,
arm bound in a SLING, holds court before a clot of
 Slytherins.
PANSY
Does it hurt terribly, Draco?
(CONTINUED)

45 CONTINUED: 45
DRACO
(a tad theatrical)
It comes and goes. Still... I
consider myself lucky. According
to Madam Pomfrey, another minute
or two... and I could've lost the
arm.
Harry, Ron and Hermione watch from the Gryffindor table.
RON
The little git. He's really
laying it on thick, isn't he?
HARRY
At least Hagrid didn't get sacked.
HERMIONE
Yes. But I hear Draco's father's
furious. I don't think we've
heard the end of this...
SEAMUS
He's been sighted!
They turn. Seamus and the other Gryffindors are huddled
over a copy of The Daily Prophet.
RON
Who?
But the PHOTOGRAPH on the Prophet's front page provides a
chilling answer: Sirius Black. Hermione reads over the
shoulders of others. WHISPERS half to herself:
HERMIONE
Achintee? That's not far from
here...
NEVILLE
You don't think he'd come to
Hogwarts, do you?
LAVENDER
With the Dementors at every
entrance?
LAVENDAR
Dementors? He's already slipped
by them once, hasn't he? Who's
to say he can't do it again?
(CONTINUED)

45 CONTINUED: (2) 45
As a flicker of fear passes through Harry's face, BEM,
a Nigerian boy, stares grimly at the grainy image of
Black.
BEM
That's right. Black could be
anywhere. It's like trying to
catch smoke. Like trying to
catch smoke with your bare
hands.
46 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MORNING 46
Beautiful flowers gleam in the dawn light, then, slowly
begin to WITHER. The dew FREEZES, the grass grows

49 INT. LUPIN'S CLASSROOM - MORNING 49
A tall WARDROBE RATTLES VIOLENTLY as Harry, Ron and
several classmates regard it warily.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Intriguing, yes? Would anyone
like to venture a guess as to
what's inside?
SEAMUS
(in a hushed voice)
That's a Boggart, that is.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can
anyone tell us what a Boggart
looks like?
HERMIONE
No one knows.
Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry.
RON
When'd she get here?
(CONTINUED)
38.
49 CONTINUED: 49
HERMIONE
Boggarts are shape-shifters.
They take the shape of whatever
a particular person fears most.
That's what makes it so --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Terrifying, yes. Luckily, a very
simple charm exists to repel a
Boggart. Let's practice it now,
shall we? Without wands,
please... Riddikulus!
STUDENTS
Riddikulus!
DRACO
(muttering softly)
It's this class that's ridiculous.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Good. So much for the easy part.
You see, the incantation alone
is not enough. What really
finishes a Boggart off is...
laughter. You need to force it
to assume a shape you find truly
amusing. Neville, come up here,
will you?
Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe, steps forward
queasily.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
What would you say is the thing
that frightens you most?
NEVILLE
Profter... Snafpt...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry.
NEVILLE
Professor Snape.
 Everyone LAUGHS good-naturedly. Lupin nods thoughtfully.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Hmmm... yes. Neville, I believe
you live with your grandmother?
(CONTINUED)
39.
49 CONTINUED: (2) 49
NEVILLE
Yes, but I don't want the Boggart
to turn into her either.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
It won't. But I want you to
picture her clothes, only her
clothes, very clearly in your
mind. Can you do that?
NEVILLE
(closing his eyes)
She carries a red handbag...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
That's fine. We don't need to
hear it. If you see it, we will.
Now, when I open this wardrobe,
Neville, here's what I want you to
do...
Lupin leans close to Neville, WHISPERS. Neville's eyes
POP OPEN in shock. Consider Lupin uncertainly.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You can do this, Neville.
Neville nods nervously, takes a deep breath.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Right then. Wand at the ready.
One. Two. Three!
SPARKS jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and
the wardrobe BURSTS OPEN. Instantly, Snape appears, eyes
flashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville backs
away in fright.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Think, Neville. Think!
NEVILLE
R-r-riddikulus!
CRACK! Snape stumbles in a FLASH OF LIGHT and
reappears... in a LONG, LACE-TRIMMED DRESS, TOWERING
MOTH-EATEN HAT, and CRIMSON HANDBAG. Instantly, the
class ROARS (except for Draco and his fellow Slytherins).
Neville blinks, amazed, then slowly, grins himself.
Lupin drops the needle on an OLD GRAMAPHONE. As a
SCRATCHY RHUMBA fills the room, he points to Ron.
(CONTINUED)
40.
49 CONTINUED: (3) 49
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Ron! Forward!
Snape DISSOLVES into a mad whirling mass, then mutates
into a... GIANT SPIDER. As Ron GASPS, Harry and Hermione
exchange an uncertain glance. Lupin puts his hands on
Ron's shoulders to steady him. Ron raises his wand.
RON
Riddikulus!
CRACK! ROLLER SKATES materialize on the spider's hairy
feet and it begins to shuffle crazily in place.
Instantly, Ron relaxes as the class' LAUGHTER rings out.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Parvati!
As Parvati steps up, the spider SPINS faster and faster,
a DIZZYING BLUR, then reappears as a VAMPIRE.
PARVATI
Riddikulus!
As the vampire WHIPS its cloak across its eyes, we CUT
BEHIND... so our POV is of the students. SWISH! The
cloak reopens, the class LAUGHS, and we REVERSE again...
see that the vampire is now dressed like CARMEN MIRANDA.
As it begins to SHIMMY about -- against its will -- the
class starts to CLAP.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Mr. Thomas!
As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body
attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched
SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA.
DEAN THOMAS
Riddikulus!
The cobra's hooded head BOBS back and forth, transforms
into a JACK-IN-THE-BOX. Lupin grins and...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Next!
... turns, sees Harry step forward expectantly. Concern
flickers through Lupin's face. The Jack-In-The-Box
pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry,
becoming more sinister, transforming into a...
(CONTINUED)
41.
49 CONTINUED: (4) 49
... Dementor. Suddenly the MUSIC FADES. Harry starts to
raise his wand, then... freezes, transfixed. The
Dementor looms closer and closer, when...
... Lupin steps between, snaps his wand.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Here!
CRACK! -- the Dementor vanishes and a ROILING MIST
 appears, which becomes CLOUDS. Something glows within
the clouds, white, silvery and round...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
POP! The orb deflates like a punctured balloon, WHIZZES
crazily about the room, then darts back into the
wardrobe. The door SLAMS SHUT and the CLASS CHEERS.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well done, everyone. I think
that's enough excitement for today.
As the students exit, chattering loudly, only Harry,
subdued, remains behind. At the doorway, Lupin glances
back, exchanges a private glance with him. As he exits,
the WARDROBE gives one last RATTLE.
50 EXT. CLOCK TOWER COURTYARD - MORNING (TWO WEEKS LATER) 50
A great buzzing queue of STUDENTS -- Third Years and
older -- each clutching a PERMISSION FORM -- pass by a
glowering Filch.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Remember! These visits to
Hogsmeade Village are a privilege.
Should your behavior reflect
poorly on the school in any way,
that privilege shall not be
extended again.
Harry approaches her, but before he can utter a syllable:
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
No permission form. No visiting
the Village. That's the rule,
Potter.
(CONTINUED)
42.
50 CONTINUED: 50
HARRY
Yes, Professor, but I thought if
 you said I could go --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
But I don't say so. A parent or
guardian must sign, and since I am
neither, it would be
inappropriate.
(a flicker of pity)
I'm sorry, Potter. But that's my
final word.
Ron and Hermione -- watching Harry expectantly from
across the way -- see him turn, shake his head. Their
faces fall. Harry raises his hand in farewell. Watches
them go.
PROFESSOR LUPIN (O.S.)
So. No Hogsmeade, eh ?

PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well, don't feel too bad. I was
roundly disappointed the first
time I went.
HARRY
Really?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
No. I was just trying to make you
feel better. Honeydukes' sweets
are the best in the world. Their
Pepper Imps are so strong you
smoke at the ears. And Zonko's
Joke Shop may be dangerous, but
 you can't beat their Stink
Pellets.

55 CONTINUED: 55
HARRY
(nodding glumly)
Not to mention The Shrieking
Shack, which, according to
Hermione, is the most severely
haunted building in Britain.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Yes, that too...
HARRY
Professor, can I ask you
something?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You'd like to know why I stopped
you from facing the Boggart.
(off Harry's surprise)
I should think it'd be obvious. I
assumed the Boggart would take the
shape of Lord Voldemort.
Harry frowns. Lupin studies him curiously.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
But clearly... I was wrong.
HARRY
I did think of Voldemort first.
But then, I remembered that night
on the train... and the
Dementors...
(CONTINUED)
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well, well. I'm impressed. That
suggests that what you fear most
of all is... fear. Very wise.
HARRY
Before I fainted... I heard
something. A woman. Screaming.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors force us to relive the
worst memories of our lives. Our
pain becomes their power.
HARRY
I think it was my mother. The
night she was murdered.
Harry looks up. Finds Lupin studying him.
(CONTINUED)
44.
55 CONTINUED: (2) 55
PROFESSOR LUPIN
The first time I saw you, Harry, I
recognized you immediately. Not
by your scar. By your eyes.
They're your mother Lily's.
(nodding)
Yes. I knew her. She was there
for me at a time when no one else
was. We used to talk for hours.
She was not only a singularly
gifted witch but an uncommonly
kind woman. She had a way of
seeing the beauty in whoever she
met, even -- and perhaps most
especially -- when that person
couldn't see it in themselves...
Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles.
 PROFESSOR LUPIN
Which perhaps explains her
affection for your father. James
had, shall we say, a certain
talent for trouble. A gift, rumor
has it, he passed on to you.
Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately. Harry smiles
vaguely.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I could tell you stories -- and
there are many about your parents,
Harry -- but know this...
(eyeing Harry intensely)
They lived. Every moment of every
day. You should know that.
That's how they'd want to be
remembered.
56 INT. GREAT HALL - EVENING (LATER) 56
The Hall buzzes with tales of Hogsmeade, as students swap
stories, sample sweets, and send SOAP BUBBLES of all
shapes, sizes and colors into the air. A MARIONETTE of a
HARLEQUIN cavorts atop the Gryffindor table, moving its
limbs in response to the STRANDS of LIGHT that extend
from Neville's fingertips. Seamus passes his hand
through the light beams and -- FLUMPH! -- the Harlequin
collapses.

RON
And Honeyduke's is brilliant!
Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees --
and blood-flavored lollipops for
Halloween!
Harry nods, picking quietly through the spray of
brilliantly colored sweets on the table. Hermione
notices.
HERMIONE
But, I mean, after awhile, it got
a bit boring. Don't you think,
Ron?
RON
Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing.
Hang on. I almost forgot. I got
you something wicked at Dervish
and Banges. It's a Pocket
Sneakoscope.
Ron places a SMALL GLASS SPINNING TOP on the table.
RON
If there's someone untrustworthy
around, it's meant to light up
and spin. Mind you, Fred and
George say it's rubbish, sold for
wizard tourists, but I thought,
you know, it can't
hurt, given that...
HARRY
Sirius Black's trying to kill me.
Harry looks up, GRINS at the two of them.
HARRY
I'm glad you had a good time.
Really. And thanks for this.

Rubbish or not, you're right. It

Let me through, please. Excuse

Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen.
GINNY

RON
Probably stuffing her face with
the apples in that still life on
the second floor again.
GINNY
No. You don't understand --
Hermione GASPS. GRABS Harry's arm. He looks. SEES:
The Fat Lady's portrait has been SLASHED VICIOUSLY, great
 strips of canvas hanging from the frame. Just then,
Dumbledore appears.
DUMBLEDORE

FILCH
There'll be no need for
ghosts, Professor...
Filch extends a crooked finger. High up, near the
ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own,
trembling.
DUMBLEDORE
Dear lady. Who did this to you?
FAT LADY

Eyes like the devil he's got. And
a soul as dark as his name. It

Nor anywhere else in the castle.
DUMBLEDORE

I didn't really expect him to
linger.
SNAPE
Remarkable feat, don't you think?
To enter Hogwarts castle on one's
own, completely undetected...
Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the
bait.
SNAPE
You may recall, prior to the start
of term, I did express my concerns
when you appointed Professor --
DUMBLEDORE
I do not believe a single
professor inside this castle
would have helped Sirius
Black enter it, Severus.
As Snape's eyes glitter darkly, Dumbledore gazes out over
the slumbering students.
DUMBLEDORE
No... I feel quite confident the
castle is safe. And I'm more than
willing to let the students return
to their Houses. But tomorrow.
For now, let them sleep...
As Dumbledore's gaze finds Harry, he shuts his eyes,
feigns sleep.

SIR CADOGAN
Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan!
Back, you scurvy braggarts! You
rogues!

Excuse me, sir, but... where's
Professor Lupin?
SNAPE
That's not really your concern, is
it, Potter? Suffice it to say,
your Professor finds himself
incapable of teaching at the
 present time. Page 394.
Snape waves the MOTH away, blows out a candle and a SLIDE
SHOW BEGINS. An ANCIENT WOODCUT of a HORRIFIC BEAST
flickers at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at
his book.
RON
Werewolves?
HERMIONE
But, sir, we've only just begun
learning about Red Caps and
Hinkypunks. We're not meant to
start nocturnal beasts for
weeks --

When did she come in? Did you see
her come in...
SNAPE
Now. Which of you can tell me the
difference between an Animagus and
a werewolf?

WEREWOLF, Hermione waiting desperately for someone to

Malfoy's PARCHMENT has reappeared.
 SNAPE
No one? How... disappointing.
HERMIONE
Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn
into an animal. A werewolf has no choice in the matter.
Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and
responds only to the call of its own kind --
Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL.
SNAPE
Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must
admit to feeling your pain. That
is the second time you have spoken
out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell
me. Are you incapable of
restraining yourself? Or do you
take pride in being an
insufferable know-it-all?
RON
(to Harry)
He's got a point, you know.
Harry stares at the parchment. Malfoy has drawn a crude
caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being STRUCK
BY LIGHTNING over and over.
SNAPE
Five points from Gryffindor!
(to the class)
As a antidote to your ignorance, I
prescribe two rolls of parchment
on the werewolf by Monday morning,
with particular emphasis placed on
recognizing it.
(suddenly)
Passing notes, Potter?
Snape SNATCHES the drawing from under Harry's nose. Eyes
it.
SNAPE
Not exactly Picasso, are you? I
hope you demonstrate more talent
on the Quidditch pitch this
weekend then you do as an artist.

SNAPE (CONT'D)
If not, I fear you'll perish,
given the weather forecast. Until
that time, however, you'll forgive
me if I don't let you off
homework. Should you die, I
assure you... you need not hand it
in.
As Snape turns away, Malfoy sniggers with Crabbe, Coyle
and PIKE. Harry glances down at the drawing once more
and we hear a true RUMBLE of THUNDER and --
CUT TO:
... a STITCH OF LIGHTNING...
66 OMITTED 66
& &
67 67
68 EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH - A STITCH OF LIGHTNING - DAY 68
as it strikes one of the GOLDEN QUIDDITCH RINGS and the
clouds bloom with ICY BLUE light. Far below, in the
stands, RAIN lashes the SEA OF UMBRELLAS. As one flies
free, soaring end over end into the sky, the...
... CROWD EXPLODES and two Quidditch squads -- Gryffindor
in SCARLET, Hufflepuff in CANARY-YELLOW -- shoot into the
air. Twin BLUDGERS FIRE skyward, and the match is on.
We CUT INTO Harry, rising like a rocket through the mist,
his robes SNAPPING VIOLENTLY in the wind.
INTERCUT HARRY'S POV
-- as he flies, RAIN falling like NEEDLES before him,
every dark cloud concealing potential danger. Beaters
crisscross his path. A BLUDGER WHIZZES past, then a
second ROCKETS DIRECTLY AT HIM.
SWOOP! -- Harry ducks, watches the BLUDGER SHATTER the
BROOM of a HUFFLEPUFF BEATER. The Beater goes into a
wild spiral, vanishes in the mist.
(CONTINUED)
53.
68 CONTINUED: 68
IN THE STANDS
Ron squints upward, the players little more than
STREAKING BLURS from his vantage. KA-SSSST! A STITCH OF
LIGHTNING strikes the TAIL of ANGELINA JOHNSON'S broom.
As it BURSTS into FLAMES, she PLUMMETS to the pitch. Ron
looks down at his own HAND. In the HIGHLY-CHARGED AIR,
the HAIR above his knuckles RISES.
In the sky, Harry flies fearlessly, searching for the
Snitch as Bludgers pierce the clouds above him and
CHASERS flit IN and OUT OF VIEW far below. Suddenly, in
the stands opposite, a BLACK UMBRELLA flies from the hand
of a RAVENCLAW GIRL. For a moment, it sails wondrously
through the heavy air, a Magritte dream, then -- WHOOP!
WHOOP! WHOOP! -- abruptly picks up speed, ROTATING LIKE
A HATCHET. Harry DUCKS, turns, and watches it disappear
into a bank of clouds. Then...
... something GLIMMERS: the Snitch. Instantly, Harry
jets off closing fast on the tiny, glimmering ball,
chasing it through one cloud... then another... and
another... until...
... he BREAKS into a clear patch of sky... only to find
the Snitch is gone. Angrily, Harry whips the Nimbus back
around, searching the horizon frantically, when he spies
something:
In the stadium's HIGHEST TOWER, something ENORMOUS
flickers briefly in SILHOUETTE, then is obscured by a
veil of mist.
Harry turns. In the distance, the stray umbrella spins
 INTO VIEW, harpoons a player. Harry's eyes shift. The
SNITCH SHIMMERS like a FIREFLY in the dark underbelly of
a cloud. Harry begins to go... when the veil of mist
shrouding the high tower shifts and -- for one brief
moment -- a GREAT DOG is revealed. As this mist closes,
Harry frowns, jets away.
As Harry pelts after the Snitch, the crowd RISES TO THEIR
FEET, ROARING. Ron GRINS over the binoculars, watching
Harry shred the mist as he urges his broom on.
HARRY
Faster!
Come on!
The trace of a smile forms on Harry's lips as he closes
on the Snitch... only yards away... reaching out...
when...
(CONTINUED)
54.
68 CONTINUED: (2) 68
... a THIN GLAZE of ICE clouds his GLASSES. He wipes at
them, then flinches: BLOOD trickles down his cheek. The
rain is turning to needles. Needles of ice. Harry
glances at the HANDLE of his BROOMSTICK. The water
sluicing through the grain is FREEZING. VAPOR streams
from his mouth and nose.
SWOOSH! A dark SILHOUETTE passes on his right. He
turns. SWOOSH! -- a twin SILHOUETTE passes on his left.
Harry sees neither. Looks down. The layers of mist are
parting below. LIGHTNING STRIKES. Reveals: an ARMY OF
SILHOUETTES drifting onto the pitch. A vast legion of
them...
DEMENTORS.
A DISTANT WHISTLE weaves into the WIND, rises in pitch,
not a whistle at all, but a... SCREAM. A WOMAN'S SCREAM.
Harry's eyes flutter, and wisps of SILVERY WHITE LIGHT
float from his mouth. His glasses glaze over completely.
His fingers, rigid, can no longer grip the broom and...
He FALLS.
HERMIONE
No!!!
Harry and broom tumble in opposite directions.
 The Nimbus soars end over end, tossed by the currents,
then drops... right into the Whomping Willow.
FLOOMPH! Harry, in freefall, drops through one cloud,
then another. Plummeting through the circling Dementors.
Then... a TALL FIGURE rises from the crowd. Raises an
OPEN HAND to the heavens. Eyes angry but clear.
Dumbledore.
An EXPLOSION -- more powerful than thunder -- rocks the
air.
A FLASH -- more fierce than lightning -- shocks the sky.
And then...
THE SCREEN GOES BLACK.
Not a sound. For the longest time. Then... VOICES:
RON
Looks a bit peaky, doesn't he?
(CONTINUED)
55.
68 CONTINUED: (3) 68
FRED
Peaky? What d'you expect him to
look like? He fell fifty feet.
GEORGE
Yeah, c'mon, Ron. We'll walk you
off the Astronomy Tower and see
how you come out looking.
HARRY
Probably a right sight better than
he normally does.
Harry opens his eyes and Ron, Fred, George, and Hermione
SLOWLY COME INTO FOCUS, standing at the foot of his bed
in the hospital wing.
HERMIONE
Harry! How're you feeling?
69 INT. HOSPITAL WING - DAY 69
As Harry edges up against his pillow, we see a NURSE in
the b.g., removing the SPOKES of an umbrella from a
Hufflepuff player's neck. Harry doesn't look so good
himself.
HARRY
Brilliant.
FRED
Gave us a right good scare, mate.
HARRY
What happened?
RON
You fell off your broom.
HARRY
Really? I meant the match. Who
won?
Silence. Uncomfortable glances.
HERMIONE
No one blames you, Harry. The
Dementors aren't meant to come on
the grounds. Dumbledore was
furious. After he saved you, he
sent them straight off.
(CONTINUED)
56.
69 CONTINUED: 69
Harry nods grimly, stares at the RAIN LASHING the window.
RON
There's something else you should
know, Harry. Your Nimbus -- when
it blew away? -- it sort of landed
in the Whomping Willow. And well...
He tips a BAG of SPLINTERED WOOD and TWISTED TWIGS onto
the bed. As Harry stares, we hear a gentle WIND, then...
PROFESSOR LUPIN (V.O.)
I'm sorry about your broom, Harry.
There's no chance of fixing it?
70 EXT. BLACK LAKE - LATE AFTERNOON 70
Harry shakes his head in response to Lupin's question,
then -- WHOOSH! -- sets Hedwig free of her traces. As
she soars into the sky, Harry and Lupin watch from the
lake's edge.
HARRY
Why do they affect me so,
Professor? I mean, more than
everyone else...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Dementors are among the foulest
creatures that walk this earth.
They feed on every good feeling,
every happy memory, until a person
is left with nothing but his worst
experiences. You're not weak,
Harry. The Dementors affect you
most, because there are true
horrors in your past. Horrors
your classmates can scarcely
imagine. You have nothing to be
ashamed of.
HARRY
I'm scared, Professor.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I'd consider you a fool if you
weren't.
(CONTINUED)
 57.
70 CONTINUED: 70
HARRY
I need to learn how to fight them.
You could teach me, Professor.
You made that Dementor on the
train go away...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
There was only one that night...
HARRY
But you made it go away.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
(a beat)
I don't pretend to be an expert,
Harry. But yes, I can teach you.
Perhaps after the holiday. For
now, though, I need to rest. I'm
feeling... tired.
Harry turns, studies Lupin's haggard face. A weary smile
appears as Hedwig's reflection glides over Lupin's
irises.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Beautiful...
Harry looks up, watches Hedwig pinwheel through the blue,
past the CLOCK TOWER and EXIT FRAME. CAMERA HOLDS, the
skies PALES, and SNOW begins to fall. We TILT DOWN...
70A EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY (WEEKS LATER) 70A
... to Hogwarts castle, weeks later, dusted in white.
71 EXT./INT. CLOCK TOWER - DAY 71
 Harry, framed in the window, stares out, looking forlorn.
In REFLECTION, SNOW falls on the glass.
HARRY'S POV
A ragged line of students follows McGonagall toward the
bridge. Harry's POV becomes OBJECTIVE and...
72 EXT. CLOCK TOWER COURTYARD - DAY 72
... FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow, moving quickly to join
the other students.
(CONTINUED)
58.
72 CONTINUED: 72
Suddenly, Fred and George appear, heading the opposite
way and... the FOOTPRINTS reverse themselves... as if
Fred and George were escorting an invisible person.
FRED
Clever, Harry.
GEORGE
But not clever enough.
FRED
Besides, we've got a better way.
73 INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 73
The great doors open and Fred and George enter. The
INVISIBILITY CLOAK drops and Harry is revealed, looking
cross. Instantly, Fred slaps a WORN ROLL OF PARCHMENT
into his hand. Harry unfurls it. Frowns. It's blank.
HARRY
What's this rubbish?
FRED
Rubbish he says. That there's the
secret to our success.
GEORGE
It's a wrench giving it to you,
believe me.
FRED
But we've decided your need's
greater than ours. George, if you
will...
GEORGE
I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good.
George touches his wand to the parchment and INTRICATE
INK LINES surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like
veins. Harry reads the CURIOUS WORDS at the top:
HARRY
'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs are proud to present
The Marauder's Map'...?
GEORGE
Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and
Prongs. We owe them so much.

Hang on. This is Hogwarts! And
 that... No. Is that really...
Harry points to a small MOVING DOT labeled "Dumbledore."
FRED
Dumbledore.
GEORGE
In his study.
FRED
Pacing.
GEORGE
Does that a lot.
HARRY
You mean, this map shows...
FRED
Everyone.
HARRY
Everyone?
GEORGE
Everyone.
FRED
Where they are.
GEORGE
What they're doing.
FRED
Every minute.
GEORGE
Of every day.
HARRY
Brilliant! Where'd you get it?
FRED
Nicked it from Filch's office, of
 course, first year. Now listen.
There's seven secret passageways
out of the castle. But we'd
recommend...

HARRY
The One-Eyed...
FRED
Witch, right. But you best hurry.
Filch is heading this way.
(as they go)
Oh. And, Harry? When you're
done, make sure to give it a tap
and say, 'Mischief managed.'
Otherwise, anyone can read it.
74 INT. DIVINATION STAIRWELL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 74
Harry approaches a STATUE of a hump-backed, ONE-EYED
WITCH.
INSERT MAP -- Harry traces his finger along the tattered
surface to an INK FIGURE labeled "Harry Potter." A tiny
SPEECH BUBBLE appears: "Dissendium."
HARRY
 Dissendium?
CLICK! The witch's EYE OPENS and the statue pivots,
revealing a DARK OPENING in the floor. As Harry
crouches, squinting, a cool DRAFT OF AIR ruffles his hair
and the CAMERA DRIFTS INTO the DARKNESS...
75 INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGEWAY - DAY (LATER) 75
A tiny LIGHT bobs in the distance, fracturing the
darkness, then Harry appears, the tip of his wand
GLOWING, map in hand. INSERT MAP: "Harry Potter" glides
across the parchment.
NEW ANGLE - DAY (LATER)
Harry stops, cranes his neck. STONE STEPS. Taps the map.
HARRY
Mischief managed.

76 INT. HONEYDUKE'S SWEETSHOP - CELLAR - SAME TIME - DAY 76
CRATES. HUGE ROLLING BINS. A WOOD STAIRCASE. A
trapdoor lifts. Harry's eyes appear. As he pulls
himself up, a DOOR BANGS OPEN. Dense CHATTER ROARS from
above. Quickly, Harry hides, watches a MAN'S BOOTS
descend the stairs. Then...
WOMAN (O.S.)
A box of Jelly Slugs as well,
Horace. We're nearly cleared out.
HORACE grunts, begins moving boxes. Harry looks up to
the cellar door, takes out the invisibility cloak...
77 INT. HONEYDUKE'S SWEETSHOP - SAME TIME - DAY 77
The CELLAR DOOR EASES open -- but no one appears. We
TRACK THROUGH a sweet tooth's dream, SWARMING with
customers. Up ahead, Neville prepares to lick the
LOLLIPOP in his hand, when it simply floats from his
fingers and out the door...
78 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - CONTINUOUS 78
ACTION - DAY
... into the MISTY, FOG-SHROUDED chaos of Main Street.
As the lollipop drifts on, FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow
below...
79 EXT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DAY (LATER) 79
At this elevation, the MIST hangs in thick, undulating
veils, the Shrieking Shack an eerie silhouette in the
gloom. Ron and Hermione stand stiffly, attempting, as
best they can, to conceal the fact that, basically,
they're scared stiff.
HERMIONE
It's meant to be the most haunted
building in Britain. Did I
mention that?
RON
Twice.
HERMIONE
Should we move a bit closer?
RON
Huh? Oh... All right...

79 CONTINUED: 79
They take a step. One step. Stop dead.
RON
Actually, it's fine from here.
HERMIONE
Perfect.
Just then, VOICES ECHO and THREE FIGURES appear over the
rise, phantoms in the mist. Malfoy. Crabbe. Goyle.
Pike.
DRACO
Well, well. Look who's here. You
two shopping for your dream home?
Seems a bit grand for you, Weasel-
Bee. Don't your family all sleep
in one room?
RON
Shut your mouth, Malfoy.
DRACO
(clucking his tongue)
Now that's not very friendly.
Boys, I think we're going to have
to teach Weasel-Bee to respect his
superiors.
HERMIONE
(a harsh chuckle)
Hope you don't mean yourself.
Malfoy's eyes shift, regard Hermione with disgust.
DRACO
How dare you speak to me, you
filthy, little mud --
SPLAT! Malfoy takes a SNOWBALL to the grill. Splutters:
DRACO
Who did that!
Malfoy glances about in confusion, when -- SPLAT!
 SPLAT! -- he takes two more. Hermione and Ron glance
about uneasily.
DRACO
Well, don't just stand there!
(CONTINUED)
63.
79 CONTINUED: (2) 79
Crabbe and Goyle start for Ron and Hermione, when --
FLUMPH! -- their knees go out and they fall headfirst
into the snow. Draco begins to back away fearfully,
eying the mist...
DRACO
Wait a minute, there's something
out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!!
Malfoy's SKI MASK is pulled over his eyes, he's spun
about, given a ROUGH KICK to the ass and sent stumbling
over the rise and out of sight. Instantly, Crabbe and
Goyle join him.
Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance,
and... DASH OFF... when -- FLUMPH! -- they both go
flying, land on their pants in the snow. As they sit up,
they hear...
LAUGHTER. Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion.
HERMIONE
Harry?
Harry...?
The Invisibility Cloak drops. Sure enough. Harry.
Grinning.
RON
That was not
Bloody hell, Harry!
funny!
 But he's smiling. They all are. As he and Hermione pelt
Harry with SNOWBALLS, we --
CUT TO:
80 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - DAY (MOMENTS 80
LATER)
The trio trudge through the SWIRLING SNOW. Harry's
donned Hermione's scarf and Ron's hat to disguise
himself.
RON
Those weasels! Never told me
about any Marauder's Map!
HERMIONE
But Harry isn't going to keep it.
He's going to turn it over to
Professor McGonagall, aren't you?
(CONTINUED)

80 CONTINUED: 80
RON
Oh sure. Along with his
invisibility cloak, his pack of
exploding snap cards, his --
HERMIONE
Oh, shut up.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
Rosmerta, m'dear!
Up ahead Cornelius Fudge emerges from a MINISTRY SLEIGH
as Hagrid swings the door clear and -- with unfortunate
ease -- rips it clean off the fittings. Fudge joins
McGonagall and a CURVY BARMAID (ROSMERTA) outside the
THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB.
HERMIONE
That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron
fancies her.
RON
It's not true!
HARRY
Shhh.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
I trust business is good?
MADAM ROSMERTA
It'd be a right sight better if
the Ministry wasn't sending
Dementors into my pub every other
night.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We have a killer on the loose.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Sirius Black? In Hogsmeade! And
what would bring him here?
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Harry Potter.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Harry Potter!

Fudge looks around nervously, then jerks his head toward
the pub. As he leads Rosmerta and McGonagall inside,
we --
CUT BACK TO:
HERMIONE AND RON
RON
Harry?
He's gone. FOOTPRINTS track through the snow, into the pub.
81 INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB - HARRY'S POV FROM UNDER THE 81
INVISIBILITY CLOAK - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
... as he THREADS THROUGH the teeming pub, PAST a SIGN
("No Underage Wizards") and nearly collides with some
very STRANGE-LOOKING PATRONS. Ron and Hermione ripple
briefly past a frosted window, then... THREE SHRUNKEN
HEADS swing INTO VIEW.
SHRUNKEN HEAD #1
So I says to him, 'Careful, Ned.
Don't want to go losing your head!'
As the three heads CACKLE HYSTERICALLY, bobbing up and
down on their strings, Harry turns... just as an UNSHAVEN
WIZARD'S arm whips down and a DART goes WHISTLING right
toward Harry's eyes. Harry DUCKS, pivots, and -- THWOCK!
-- sees the dart pierce the cork of the disfigured
DARTBOARD behind him.
Harry hurries on, trailing Fudge and McGonagall up a DARK
STAIRWELL as Rosmerta leads them into a small BACK ROOM.
As the door starts to close, Harry rushes forward: SLAM!
Too late. CAMERA TILTS. The KNOB turns, the door
opens...
82 INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS PUB - CARD ROOM - DAY 82
... and SNOW flutters off the sill of a HALF-OPEN WINDOW.
McGonagall turns, frowning, and re-closes the door,
harder this time, then joins Fudge and Rosmerta. HARRY'S
POV SHIFTS FROM one TO the other as they speak.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Come on then. Let's hear it.
(CONTINUED)
66.
82 CONTINUED: 82
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Years ago, when Harry Potter's
parents were marked for death,
they went into hiding. Few knew
where they were. One who did was
black. And he told...
MADAM ROSMERTA
You-Know-Who. I've heard this
rot. It was all over The Daily
Prophet back in the day. And I'll
say now what I said then: Of all
the boys I ran out of here,
Black's the last who would've gone
over to the dark side. Hearsay.
That's all the Ministry had.
Hearsay.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Ha! Tell that to Peter Pettigrew!
MADAM ROSMERTA
Peter Pettigrew?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Little lump of a boy? Always
tagging after Black and...
 MADAM ROSMERTA
I remember him. What's he got to
do with it?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
After the Potters were killed,
Pettigrew went looking for Black.
And, unfortunately... found him.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Black was vicious. He didn't kill
Pettigrew. He destroyed him. A
finger. That's all that was left.
A finger -- there's your hearsay.
Rosmerta looks to McGonagall. She nods grimly.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Sirius Black may not have put his
hands to the Potters, but he's the
reason they're dead. And now he
wants to finish what he started.
MADAM ROSMERTA
Harry.

67.
82 CONTINUED: (2) 82
McGonagall nods, then looks pained.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
But that's not the worst of it.
MADAM ROSMERTA
What could be worse?
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
This: Sirius Black was and
remains today... Harry Potter's
godfather.
BLAM! The pub doors fly open, REVEAL Main Street, where
Ron and Hermione wait, rubbing their hands against the
 chill. As they look down, CAMERA TILTS...
83 EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - MOMENTS LATER - 83
DAY
... and FOOTPRINTS appear in the snow. HARRY'S POV ENDS.
CAMERA TILTS UP, FOLLOWS Hermione and Ron until they
LEAVE FRAME, then HOLDS ON a POSTER of BLACK, fluttering
against a lamppost: "Have you seen this wizard?"
84 EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 84
At the end of a ROCKY OUTCROP, the FOOTPRINTS end and
SOBS are heard. Ron takes Hermione's arm, discouraging
her from going further, but she does, filling the
footprints with her own, then kneeling and -- very gently
-- drawing the cloak from Harry. He stares into the
mist, eyes stinging with tears.
HARRY
He was their friend. And he
betrayed them. He was their
friend.
(eyes hardening)
I hope he finds me. But when he
does, I'm going to be ready. When
he does, I'm going to kill him.
85 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (TRANSITION TO SPRING) 85
Butterflies flutter over the great green lawn. The GIANT
SQUID breaks through the last GLAZE of ICE on the Black
Lake. The Whomping Willow shakes the water from its
branches...
68.
86 INT. ASTRONOMY ROOM - DUSK 86
The DYING SUN streams through high windows, painting
Harry's face a fierce AMBER-RED as he stands opposite
Lupin. ANCIENT CHARTS drape the walls while gleaming
SPHERES OF SPUN GLASS ORBIT one another silently. Lupin
paces before a LARGE TRUNK.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're sure about this, Harry?
This is very advanced magic. Well
beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level.
HARRY
If Black can fight the Dementors,
I need to know how too.
Lupin studies Harry -- as if conflicted -- then decides.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well. The spell I'm going to
teach you is called the Patronus
Charm. Ever hear of it?
Harry shakes his head.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A Patronus is a kind of positive
force. For the wizard who can
conjure one, the Patronus works
something like a shield. The
Dementor feeds on it instead of
him.
Just then, the trunk RATTLES VIOLENTLY. As Harry's eyes
wander, Lupin SNAPS his fingers, brings his attention
back.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
But in order for it to work, you
must think of a memory. And not
just any. This memory needs to be
a very happy one. And powerful.
Harry thinks a bit. Then... nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Got something? Good. Let it fill
you up. Lose yourself in it.
Then speak the incantation:
Expecto Patronum. Without your
wand...
HARRY
Expecto Patronum...
(CONTINUED)
69.
86 CONTINUED: 86
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Right then. Shall we?
Harry nods, raises his wand. Lupin, watching closely,
reaches over, grips the lid of the TRUNK...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Concentrate, Harry.
Concentrate...
As Lupin FLINGS open the case, Harry OPENS HIS EYES. In
the sun's BLOOD-LIGHT, the Dementor looks particularly
horrific.
HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...
The torches on the wall FLICKER as a CHILL BREEZE fills
the chamber. A SCREAM ECHOES distantly. Harry's hand
trembles. His eyes begin to roll up...
HARRY
Expecto... Expecto...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Here!
CRACK! -- the Dementor mutates into a SILVERY WHITE ORB.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
Lupin flicks his wand, sends the orb back into the
packing case. Harry stands blinking. Dazed. Lupin
fishes a CHOCOLATE FROG from his pocket. Presses it into
Harry's trembling hand.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Quickly.
Harry studies the frog. Takes a bite. Begins to
recover.
 HARRY
That's one nasty Dementor.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Boggart, Harry. The real thing
would be much, much worse. Just
out of interest, what were you
thinking of? What memory did you
choose?
(CONTINUED)

86 CONTINUED: (2) 86
HARRY
The first time I rode a broom.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
That's not good enough, Harry.
Not nearly.
Harry glances toward the window, at the bloody sun.
HARRY
There's another. It's not happy
exactly. I mean, it is. It's the
happiest I've ever felt. But
it's... complicated.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Is it strong?
Harry looks up into Lupin's eyes. Emotional. Nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Then let's try it.
Harry takes a breath. Tosses the frog aside. Poises
himself.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Think, Harry, think --
HARRY
Just do it!
Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness. Opens the
packing case. Instantly, the Dementor appears again. A
chill fills the air. The hair skates off Harry's scar.
He sets his jaw...
HARRY
Expecto Patronum!
Harry's hand TREMBLES. His whole BODY TREMBLES. But he
holds his ground, when -- WHOOSH! -- a huge SILVER SHADOW
BURSTS from the end of his wand, hovering between him and
the Dementor. The Dementor falters... Harry's legs like
water...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Riddikulus!
CRACK! The Dementor vanishes. Harry's arm drops.
Slack. Lupin eyes Harry with a kind of awe. His voice
barely a WHISPER.

86 CONTINUED: (3) 86
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Well done.
HARRY
I think I've had enough. For
today.
Lupin nods. Watches Harry move to the door.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
So you know, Harry: You'd have
given your father a run for his
money. And, believe me, that's
saying something.
Harry ponders this. Then speaks, deep inside himself.
 HARRY
I was thinking of him. And Mum.
Seeing their faces. They're just
talking to me. Just... talking.
That was the memory I chose. I
don't even know if it's real...
Harry grips the door, pushes past.
HARRY
But it's the best I have.

All the boys asleep.
All except Harry, who lies in bed, studying the photo of
his parents, barely visible in the fluttering light of a
guttering candle. As the FLAME DIES with a soft HISS,
all goes BLACK and we --
CUT TO:
88 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT (LATER) 88
A hulking, haunted goliath against the sky.
89 EXT. COURTYARD - NIGHT 89
A cautious breeze rises. Leaves scud across the gravel.
90 INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT 90
A church. Empty. Silent.
72.
91 INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT 91
A WINDOWPANE RATTLES, up high, the corridor thatched in
shadow. Slowly... CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE. CREEPING
FORWARD. A SHADOW ENGULFS Sir Cadogan, dozing against
his tree...
92 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 92
A WHISTLE SHRIEKS. The Sneakoscope, whirling madly,
skitters across the bedside cabinet and -- CLICK! CLICK!
CLICK! -- taps against a WATER GLASS, sending shafts of
RED LIGHT pinwheeling over the photo of Harry's
parents...
RON
Aaaahhhh!
Harry BOLTS UP, sees a SILHOUETTE etched on the window --
a MAN CLUTCHING A KNIFE. All the boys are up now.
Screaming. Amid the chaos, Harry grabs his wand.
HARRY
Everybody out!
The others flee. Harry faces the HULKING SHADOW, wand
poised.
HARRY
Show yourself.
Crash! The water GLASS SHATTERS on the floor and
Scabbers darts past Harry's bare feet, chased by
Crookshanks. Seizing the moment, the SILHOUETTE grasps
the curtains and swings through the open window, plunging
into the night. Harry rushes to the window, looks down.
92A EXT. GRYFFINDOR TOWER - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 92A
The SILHOUETTE leaps from ledge to ledge with an animal's
grace, then... vanishes.
92B INT. TOWER DORMITORY - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 92B
 Harry sweeps Ron's curtains aside. His bed is... empty.
HARRY
Ron!
Ron!
Harry's eyes flash toward the window, when... Ron pokes
his head out from under the bed.
RON
Is he gone?
73.
93 INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) 93
The entire Gryffindor House, in pajamas, stand before
McGonagall, who wears a TARTAN ROBE and an expression of
singular irritation.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
That's preposterous, Weasley. How
could Sirius Black possibly have
got through the portrait hole?
RON
I don't know how he got in! I was
a bit busy dodging his knife!
Just then, a curiously content Crookshanks wends his way
through Ron's legs.
RON
And this bloody cat ate my rat!
HERMIONE
That's a lie!
RON
It is not and you bloody well know it!
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Silence!
McGonagall turns then and everyone follows her eye to Sir
Cadogan who, sensing the attention, perks up instantly.
 DUMBLEDORE
Sir Cadogan. Is it possible that
you let a mysterious man enter
Gryffindor Tower tonight?
SIR CADOGAN
Certainly, good lady! He had the
password. Had the whole week's,
in fact. On a little piece of
paper.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Which abysmally foolish person
wrote down the passwords and then
proceeded to lose them!
Every eye shifts once more: Neville. McGonagall sighs.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Is it always going to be you,
Longbottom?
(CONTINUED)
74.
93 CONTINUED: 93
NEVILLE
I'm afraid so, ma'am.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
(to the group at large)
While we know Sirius Black is gone
tonight, I think you can safely
assume he will, at some future
time, attempt to return. Let me
be clear. You are not to move
about the castle alone. And you
are not to write down the
password! Understood!
A collective nod of the head. McGonagall gives the ties
of her robe a sharp tug, collects herself, and exits.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Very well then. Go to bed.
As the students drift off, Ron casts a last angry glance
toward Hermione, who now holds Crookshanks in her arms.
HARRY
 I could've killed him.
Hermione turns, sees Harry staring out the window.
HARRY
He was right there. Close enough to touch.
I could've killed him.

96A EXT. SLOPE - DAY 96A
The trio make their way down the slope.
RON
I find it astonishing that someone
who prides herself on being so
logical can be in such denial.
HERMIONE
Harry. Will you explain to your
friend Ronald that he has
absolutely no proof whatsoever
that my sweet, unassuming cat ate
his shabby, decidedly decrepit
rat.
(CONTINUED)
75.
96A CONTINUED: 96A
 RON
Harry was there! He'll tell you
how it was. Go on, Harry, tell
her.
HARRY
No, I won't. Know why? Because I
don't care about your stupid rat!
I don't care about your stupid
cat! I've got few other things on
my mind right now!
RON
Really? Wasn't you had to roll
under the bed last night to avoid
getting cut to ribbons! A person
could die being your friend,
Harry!
Ron stops, wishes he could take it back. They all wish
he could. Avoiding each other's eyes, they turn,
continue on.
97 EXT. BLACK LAKE - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 97
Hagrid, wearing a GIGANTIC, HAIRY BROWN SUIT and perhaps
the world's ugliest YELLOW AND ORANGE TIE, stands knee-
deep in the shallows of the Black Lake, skimming rocks as
big as flagstones across the water's shiny gloss. As he
turns, the trio catches a brief sight of his eyes, red
with tears, then he looks away.
HERMIONE
How'd it go, Hagrid?
HAGRID
Buckbeak liked London.
HERMIONE
I meant the hearing.
HAGRID
Oh. That. Well, I got up an'
said my bit -- You know, how
Buckbeak was a good Hippogriff an'
as long as yeh treated 'im with
respect, he'd treat you the same.
Then Lucius Malfoy got up an' said
his bit -- you know, how Buckbeak
 was a deadly dangerous beast that
no teacher in their righ' mind
would expose their students to...
(CONTINUED)
76.
97 CONTINUED: 97
HERMIONE
(dreading it)
And...?
Hagrid slings another rock into water.
HERMIONE
You mustn't blame yourself,
Hagrid.
RON
Draco. It's him the Committee
should punish. It's him they
should send off to the forest, not
Buckbeak.
HAGRID
Buckbeak's not going back to the
forest...
HERMIONE
(dreading the answer)
Where's he going, Hagrid?
HAGRID
He asked fer the worse, yeh see,
Lucius Malfoy did. An' the
Committee granted it. Buckbeak's
bin sentenced ter death.
98 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT 98
Dark. Ominous. Dementors drift in the distance.
Restless...
99 INT. TOWER DORMITORY - NIGHT 99
Silent. A room of shadows. While those around him
slumber, Harry lies awake, unable to sleep. Finally, he
turns to his cupboard, takes the Marauder's Map.
WHISPERS:
HARRY
I solemnly swear that I am up to
no good.
The crooked corridors and serpentine passageways of
Hogwarts radiate across the parchment, then... a TINY DOT
catches Harry's eye. He frowns. It reads: "Peter
Pettigrew."
77.
100 INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 100
Harry moves down a DARK corridor, map in hand, WAND
AGLOW. In the PAINTINGS he passes, the subjects SNORE
SOFTLY.
INSERT - MARAUDER'S MAP
"Harry Potter" and "Peter Pettigrew" draw closer and
closer.
BACK TO SCENE
Harry squints toward the end of the corridor. Down at
the map. Pettigrew moves quickly down the adjoining
corridor. Twenty yards away. Ten. Only seconds away...
Wand trembling in his hand, Harry glances from the map to
the dark corridor ahead, again and again. Then... as the
two DOTS are about to collide... he looks slowly up...
turns the corner... heart in his chest... and meets...
HIMSELF
... reflected in a MIRROR. He BLINKS, startled, then
glances back down at the map. Pettigrew has moved past
him. Confused, Harry wheels, casts his wand along the
walls.
VOICE (O.S.)
Watch it there, boy!
Harry JUMPS. But it's only an OLD MAN in a PAINTING,
scowling in the glare of Harry's wand light. On the map,
"Pettigrew" continues to move away. Harry makes to
follow, then stops. HEARS FOOTSTEPS. The WAND'S SPOT
dances across the parchment, finds another DOT.
Approaching FAST: "Severus Snape."
HARRY
Mischief managed!
Harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and
turns... into the harsh glare of Snape's wand.
SNAPE
Potter. What're you doing
wandering the corridors at night?
HARRY
I was... I was... sleepwalking...
A sneer curdles the corners of Snape's lips.
(CONTINUED)
78.
100 CONTINUED: 100
SNAPE
How extraordinarily like your
father you are, Potter. He, too,
was exceedingly arrogant.
Strutting about the castle --
HARRY
My dad didn't strut. Nor do I.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd
appreciate you lowering your wand.
Snape eyes Harry coldly. Containing himself. Lowers his
wand.
SNAPE
Turn out your pockets.
Harry doesn't move, eyes still boring into Snape.
SNAPE
Turn out your pockets!
Finally, Harry obliges. Seeing the map, Snape's eyes
glitter.
SNAPE
And this. What might it be?
HARRY
Spare bit of parchment...
SNAPE
Really...
(poising his wand)
Reveal your secret!
To Harry's horror, words begin to appear. Snape studies
him, a sadistic half-smile on his lips. Turns the map
his way.
SNAPE
Read it.
HARRY
'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot
and Prongs offer their compliments
to Professor Snape and...'
SNAPE
Go on.
(CONTINUED)
79.
100 CONTINUED: (2) 100
HARRY
'... and request that he keep his
abnormally large nose out of other
people's business.'
SNAPE
(smile drooping)
Why you insolent little --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Professor...?
Snape turns. Sees Lupin standing in the shadows.
SNAPE
Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little
walk in the moonlight, are we?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry? You all right?
SNAPE
That remains to be seen. I've
just now confiscated a rather
curious artifact from Mr. Potter.
Take a look, Lupin. This is
supposed to be your area of
expertise.
Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather
unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions.
SNAPE
Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic.
 PROFESSOR LUPIN
I seriously doubt that, Severus.
It looks to me as if it merely
insults anyone who tries to read
it. I suspect it's a Zonko
product. Nevertheless, I shall
pursue any hidden qualities it may
possess. As you say, it's my area
of expertise. Come, Harry.
101 INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN'S OFFICE - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER) 101
Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map
fiercely.
(CONTINUED)
80.
101 CONTINUED: 101
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I don't know how this map came to
be in your possession, Harry, but
I'm astounded that you didn't turn
it in. Did you ever stop to think
that this -- in the hands of
Sirius Black -- is a map to you?
Harry walks silently. Lupin can barely contain his anger.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father didn't set much store
by rules either. But he and your
mother did give their lives to
save yours. Gambling their
sacrifice by walking about the
castle unprotected, with a killer
on the loose, strikes me as a poor
way to repay them. I won't cover
up for you again, Harry.
Lupin enters his office, tosses the map on his desk, and
begins to sort through some papers. Harry lingers
briefly in the doorway, absently eyes the WAXING MOON
 that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn
away. Stops.
HARRY
Professor. Just so you know, I
don't think the map always works.
Earlier, it showed someone in the
castle. Someone I know to be dead.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
(only half-listening)
And who was that, Harry?
HARRY
Peter Pettigrew.
Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his
papers.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Very well. I'd like you to return
to your dormitory now. Oh, and
Harry? Don't take any detours.
As Harry looks back, Lupin taps the map.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
If you do. I'll know.

CLOSEUP - CRYSTAL BALL
murky with smoke.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY (V.O.)
Relax... Let your mind... go...
102 INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING 102
The students gaze into CRYSTAL BALLS, faces reflecting
the mist within, so that their very skin seems to be made
of smoke.
Conspicuously, Harry, Ron and Hermione sit apart.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Crystal-gazing requires that you
clear the Inner Eye. Only then,
will you... See. Oh my, what do
we have here...?
As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her
eyes.
HERMIONE
Here we go again. It's the Grim!
It's the Grim!
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
(eyes narrowing)
My dear, from the moment you first
arrived in my class, I sensed that
you did not possess the proper
spirit for the noble art of
Divination. You may be young in
years, but the heart that beats
beneath your bosom is as shriveled
as an old maid's, your soul as dry
as the pages of the books to which
you so desperately cleave.
Stung, Hermione starts to reply, but -- remarkably --
seems incapable of a single word. Rising gracelessly,
she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry
watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the
doorway...
LAVENDER
'In late spring, one of our number
will leave us forever!' You knew,
Professor! You saw.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
On these occasions, I take no joy
in my gift, Miss Brown.
82.
102A EXT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - MORNING (LATER) 102A
As the students exit, Ron, walking separately from Harry,
turns to Neville.
RON
She's gone mental, Hermione has.
I mean, not that she wasn't always
mental, but now it's out in the
open for everyone to see...
Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry
watches him go, along with the others, then spies
Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing.
102B INT. DIVINATION CLASSROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 102B
Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts
to go, when... the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly
DARKENS. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that
appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then,
a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and...
... a HAND SNATCHES Harry's shoulder. He wheels,
finds...
HARRY
Professor Trelawney --
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
He will return tonight....
Harry stiffens. Trelawney's voice is eerily HOLLOW.
HARRY
S-sorry?
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
Tonight, when the clock strikes
twelve, the servant shall break
free. He and his Master shall be
reunited. It cannot be prevented.
Trelawney smiles savagely... then her head falls forward.
When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon
Harry's shoulder. Her hand.
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY
 So sorry, dear boy. Did you say
something?
Her voice is normal once more. Harry shakes his head.
HARRY
No. Nothing.
83.
103 INT. DIVINATION STAIRWELL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 103
Harry -- clearly unsettled by his encounter with
Trelawney -- hastens down the stairs, and we...
FADE OUT.
104 INT. CLOCKTOWER COURTYARD - DAY (LATER) 104
SWOOK! SWOOK! We FADE UP ON a MOVING POV OF a CROW as
it glides to the flock circling the feet of a POT-BELLIED
MAN (THE EXECUTIONER) sitting in the courtyard. As he
sharpens his AXE -- SWOOK! SWOOK! -- we --
CUT TO:
HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE
hurrying past. The Executioner looks up and we --
CUT TO:
105 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - BRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON 105
... Harry, leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut.
HERMIONE
I can't believe they're going to
kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible.
HARRY
It just got worse.
She and Ron look and SEE:
106 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - LATE 106
AFTERNOON
Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurks within a
grouping of monolithic menhirs, BINOCULARS in hand,
spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch,
tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. Hagrid wipes his eyes,
lopes into the hut.
DRACO
Did you see the big, fat
blubbering oaf?! Oh, this is
going to be rich. Did I tell you,
Father said I can keep the head --
(looking up)
Ah. Come to see the show?
(CONTINUED)
84.
106 CONTINUED: 106
HERMIONE
You... foul... loathsome...
evil... little cockroach...
Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear
as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose,
when...
RON
Hermione! No!
She turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. He looks away.
RON
He's not worth it.
Hermione nods, then -- SMACK! -- quick as lightning,
lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat
on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs,
Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind.
HERMIONE
That felt good.
107 EXT. SLOPE/PUMPKIN PATCH - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 107
LATER)
The trio makes their way down the slope and past
Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction.
108 INT. HAGRID'S HUT - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK) 108
Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak. Harry and
Ron sit. Hermione makes tea.
HAGRID
Look at 'em. Loves the smell
o' the trees when the wind
blows...
HARRY
I say we set him free.
HAGRID
(shaking his head)
They'd know I did it. And tha'
would only get Dumbledore in
trouble. Gonna come down, yeh
know. Says he wants ter be with
me when it... when it happens.
Great man, Dumbledore.
(CONTINUED)
85.
108 CONTINUED: 108
HERMIONE
We'll stay with you too, Hagrid.
HAGRID
Yeh will not! Think I wan' yeh
seein' a thing like this! No.
Yeh'll drink yer tea an' be off.
But before yeh do -- I wan' ter
see you an' Ron shake hands,
Harry.
Ron and Harry exchange a glance, then look to Hagrid.
HAGRID
Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin
betw'n you two? Go on now...
Reluctantly, Harry and Ron extend their hands. Shake.
HAGRID
Good. Now then. Ron, I wan' ter
see you give Hermione a hug.
HERMIONE/RON
What!
HAGRID
Go on! You two've been at it all
year. An' I'm sick o' it.
Acutely uncomfortable, Hermione and Ron step forward and
perform perhaps the most awkward hug Hogwarts has ever
seen.
HAGRID
Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most
pathetic hug I e'er seen. But yeh
did it, an' tha's wha' matters.
There's jus' one other thing...
 RON
I'm not kissing Fang if that's
what you're thinking...
Hearing his name, FANG -- Hagrid's giant boarhound --
THUMPS his tail happily on the floor. Hagrid turns,
takes the lid from a FLOUR TIN, A TINY HEAD, ears flecked
with powder, emerges.
RON
Scabbers! You're alive!
(CONTINUED)
86.
108 CONTINUED: (2) 108
HAGRID
Yeh should keep a closer eye on
yer pets, Ron.
HERMIONE
I think you owe someone an
apology.
RON
Right. Next time I see
Crookshanks, I'll let him know.
HERMIONE
I meant me.
HAGRID
Crikey. Here we go agin...
SMASH! A GLASS JAR on the SHELF SHATTERS. As Hermione
scoops up a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE, a second STONE
bounces off the back of Harry's head.
HARRY
Ow!
Harry turns, looks out the window.
HARRY
Hagrid...
Everyone turns. Looks. Dumbledore and Fudge approach.
Behind them, in a fluttering shroud of CROWS, the
Executioner follows, axe at his side. Hagrid begins to
panic.
HAGRID
Yeh got to go! It's almost dark.
Anyone sees yeh outside the castle
it'll be trouble! Big trouble!
'Specially you, Harry --
BANG! BANG! BANG! The door SHAKES. Hagrid stiffens in
fear. Harry reaches up, puts his finger to Hagrid's
trembling lips, speaks softly to the others.
HARRY
C'mon.
109 EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - PUMPKIN PATCH - WIDE SHOT - DUSK 109
(MOMENTS LATER)
As the trio exit through the back door, Fudge, Dumbledore
and the Executioner enter through the front.
(CONTINUED)
87.
109 CONTINUED: 109
A veil of crows flutters onto the roof. More drop into
the patch, begin to slowly circle Buckbeak.
Harry and the others duck behind the pumpkins, watch
Hagrid solemnly greet the others. Fudge appears at the
window. Picks his nose. Just then, a Shhh! is heard.
Hermione turns. The branches of the trees behind her are
 DANCING ODDLY.
HARRY
What?
HERMIONE
Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.
110 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 110
The trio slip silently into a stand of trees. Beyond
them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun.
High in the CLOCK TOWER, a BELL begins to TOLL.
DING!
DING!
DING!
The trio stops, fighting their tears. A QUARTET OF BLEAK
SHADOWS files from the hut. One of the SHADOWS --
Dumbledore -- raises his hand and points, directing the
attention of the others away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore
speaks briefly -- unintelligible from this distance,
then -- CAW! CAW! -- The crows SHRIEK excitedly and the
Executioner separates from the others, disappears behind
a LOW STAND OF TREES.
DING!
All goes very still. The wind loses its voice...
DING!
Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the trees,
INTO VIEW...
DING!
The ax hangs seemingly forever, etched against the sky,
then drops from sight. A SICKENING CHOP! fouls the
breeze and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb
disbelief. Hermione, face turned away, trembles...
(CONTINUED)
88.
110 CONTINUED: 110
DING!
The SUN sets, dropping behind the mountains in the
distance. Hermione turns. Sees a frenzied spray of
crows stain the bloody sky, their PRIMAL SHRIEKING rising
like a curse.
Slowly, Hermione's hand falls onto Ron's shoulder and
CAMERA FALLS WITH her, CONTINUING DOWN the length of
Ron's arm to his hand, where a DROP OF BLOOD hangs from
his finger, drops like a tear...
DING!
Ron stares at his hand. At the blood running down his
finger.
RON
He bit me...
His eyes shift. See Scabbers streaking away.
HERMIONE
Ron! No!
As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give
chase.
110A EXT. RIDGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 110A
Ron reaches the summit, disappears over the top.
Hermione and Harry follow.
110B EXT. WHOMPING WILLOW - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DUSK 110B
Harry and Hermione reach the top of the ridge. Stop.
HERMIONE
Harry. You do realize what tree
 this is...
Ron nabs Scabbers, cradles him in his bloody palm.
RON
Now behave yourself.
CAMERA PULLS BACK: Ron is kneeling under the Whomping
Willow.
(CONTINUED)
89.
110B CONTINUED: 110B
HARRY
That's not good.
(yelling)
Ron! Run!
Ron spins. Looks toward Harry.
RON
Harry! Run!
Harry's eyes shift. Bounding toward him in the gathering
gloom is an ENORMOUS, PALE-EYED, JET-BLACK... DOG. Harry
shields himself when... the dog LEAPS CLEAR OVER HIM.
RON
Aaaahhh!
The dog's TEETH flash and -- SNAP! -- close on Ron's
foot, dragging him TOWARDS THE TRUNK like a rag doll.
Instantly, Harry dashes forward, leaps out, and grabs
Ron's hands... but he and Ron just keep skudding along
the ground.
HERMIONE
I've got you --
Hermione pitches herself onto Harry's feet... and the
three of them go scudding along.
RON
Harry!
Harry raises his chin. The dog vanishes into the GAP at
the base of the tree, begins to pull Ron through...
HARRY
Hold on, Ron!
But it's no use. The dog is too powerful. Harry glances
around desperately, then finds himself looking directly
in Ron's eyes. He can read his mind.
HARRY
No, Ron...
One by one, Ron releases his fingers from Harry's
forearm. Sacrificing himself.
HARRY
Nooooo!!!
But Ron closes his eyes, releases his hands fully, and...
(CONTINUED)
90.
110B CONTINUED: (2) 110B
Disappears. As his VOICE ECHOES deep into the earth...
Harry and Hermione rise, peer into the hole.
WHOMP! The Whomping Willow sweeps first Hermione, then
Harry, into the air and -- FLOOMPH -- drops them on their
backsides.
HARRY AND HERMIONE'S POV - THE BRANCHES OVERHEAD
Swaying beautifully against the dusky sky, swishing
softly.
BACK TO SCENE
As one, they rise. Run back toward the gap in the tree.
A branch swoops down.
Hermione ducks. Harry doesn't. WHOOSH -- he is flung
 one way, his GLASSES the other.
Hermione HOPS over another branch -- looks briefly
pleased with herself -- only to find herself SWEPT HIGH
IN THE AIR by a second branch. She looks down, sees
Harry searching the ground for his glasses.
HERMIONE
Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!!
Harry squints up, sees a PILE-DRIVING FIST of a branch
screaming straight down for his head. He rolls away just
as -- WHOMP! -- the branch PULVERIZES the ground.
Hermione WHIPS THROUGH FRAME, still clinging on for dear
life, and Harry rises. FLUMPH! -- he's promptly knocked
to the ground again. Hermione goes CRASHING through the
high branches, Harry spies his glasses and grabs them.
Rising, he fits them to his face and...
HIS BLURRY POV...
... turns CRYSTAL CLEAR just in time to see Hermione
FLYING MADLY TOWARD HIM.
HERMIONE
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
HARRY
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
Hermione reaches out, grabs Harry's shirt and -- riding
the branch in tandem -- the two boomerang back, hurtling
toward the trunk of the tree, through the gap, and into
the darkness...
91.
111 INT. WILLOW ROOTS - TUNNEL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 111
... below. OOMPH! Harry hits the ground hard. OOMPH!
Hermione falls on top of him.
HERMIONE
Thanks.
HARRY
Don't mention it. Lumos.
 As the tip of Harry's WAND GLOWS, reveals a long, snaking
tunnel.
HERMIONE
Where do you suppose this goes?
HARRY
I have a hunch. I just hope I'm
wrong...
111A INT. TUNNEL TO SHRIEKING SHACK - NIGHT 111A
Harry and Hermione make their way through the primitive
passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead.
Then, abruptly, the tunnel... ends. Confused, Harry and
Hermione glance about, then -- as one -- peer up. A
small opening. Harry reaches up, hoists himself through.
112 INT. SHRIEKING SHACK - DECREPIT ROOM - NIGHT 112
Harry pulls Hermione up. Looks about. Paper peels from
the walls. Stains -- suspiciously similar to dried blood
-- blot the floorboards. Shattered furniture lies strewn
everywhere.
HERMIONE
We're in the Shrieking Shack,
aren't we?
Harry doesn't answer, staring at the DOG PRINTS in the DUST
on the floor. The CEILING CREAKS. They dash to the stairs.
113 INT. HALLWAY - LANDING - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 113
They come out, look down. A wide, shiny stripe cuts
through the DUST-LADEN floor -- as if something has been
dragged -- to the end of the hallway, where a LIGHT seeps
from a door.
HARRY
Nox.
(CONTINUED)
92.
113 CONTINUED: 113
His wand-light dies. Slowly, they step to the door.
Exchange a look. She nods, wand ready, and Harry KICKS
the door aside.
114 INT. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME 114
Ron sits upon a sagging bed, clutching his bloody foot.
HERMIONE
Ron! You're okay --
HARRY
The dog -- where's the --
RON
He's the dog.
It's a trap, Harry.
He's an Animagus...
Harry looks down, follows the PAW PRINTS on the floor to
a pair of FILTHY HUMAN FEET. Harry looks up slowly at
the MAN standing in the shadows. Filthy, matted hair
hangs to his shoulders. His skin like a corpse.
SIRIUS BLACK.
He studies Harry's face keenly. Harry draws his wand.
HERMIONE
If you want to kill Harry, you'll
-- you'll... have to kill us, too!
SIRIUS BLACK
No. Only one will die tonight.
HARRY
Then it'll be you!
HERMIONE
Harry! No!
Just then, FOOTSTEPS sound. Black wheels toward the
door, edgy. Harry eyes Black, wand hand shaking
violently. As Black turns back, he stops, regards Harry
cautiously.
SIRIUS BLACK
Going to kill me, Harry?
HARRY
Yes.
(CONTINUED)
93.
114 CONTINUED: 114
Harry raises his wand. BLAM! -- the DOOR CRASHES OPEN:
Lupin.
HARRY/HERMIONE/RON
Professor Lupin!
Lupin ignores them, eying Black intensely.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Looking a bit ragged, aren't we,
Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
the madness within.
SIRIUS BLACK
You'd know all about the madness
within, wouldn't you, Remus?
The two regard each other, the moment taut with tension,
then Lupin steps forward and... EMBRACES Black like a
brother.
HERMIONE
No! I trusted you! I covered up
for you. And all this time you've
been his friend!
 (pointing)
He's a werewolf! That's why he's
been missing classes!
Harry and Ron stare, dumbfounded, at Lupin. Black HOWLS
then, bitterly amused. Lupin eyes him, then turns back.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
How long have you known?
HERMIONE
Since Professor Snape set the
essay.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
You're the brightest witch of your
age I've ever met, Hermione.
SIRIUS BLACK
Yes, you glow like the sun. And
you howl at the moon. Enough
talk! He dies. Now. If you
won't do it with me, Remus, I'll
do it alone.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Wait, Sirius --
(CONTINUED)
94.
114 CONTINUED: (2) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
I did my waiting! Twelve years of
it! In Azkaban! Trust me, you
wouldn't have lasted a week!
Lupin eyes Black, then nods.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
All right then. As you wish...
HARRY
No!
Harry raises his wand when Lupin wheels and, with a flick
of his own, disarms him. Furious, Harry eyes Black
murderously.
HARRY
You betrayed my parents! You sold
them to Voldemort!
SIRIUS BLACK
It's a lie! I never would've
betrayed James and Lily!
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry! You've got to listen --
HARRY
Did he listen! When my mother was
dying! Did he hear her screaming!
SIRIUS BLACK
No! I wasn't there! And I'll
regret it the rest of my life!
Harry's eyes flash to Black's, glittering with pain.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Someone else betrayed your
parents, Harry. Someone in this
room right now. Someone who,
until quite recently, I believed
to be dead.
SIRIUS BLACK
He's as good as dead.
HARRY
What're you talking about?
There's nobody here.
(CONTINUED)
95.
114 CONTINUED: (3) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
Oh yes there is...
Black turns then, to Ron, and CROONS in a cruel sing
song:
SIRIUS BLACK
Come out, come out, Peter
Come out, come out and play...
Ron draws back from Black's demented gaze.
RON
You're mad...
Harry's eyes shift from Ron's FACE to his HANDS, where
Scabbers TWISTS violently. As a curious expression
befalls Harry, Lupin and Black, as one, raise their
wands... when.
SNAPE
Expelliarmus!
The wands fly from their hands. The others turn, find
Snape standing in the doorway, smiling smugly.
SNAPE
(eying Black)
Ah, vengeance is sweet. How I
hoped I'd be the one to catch you.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Severus --
SNAPE
I told Dumbledore you were helping
your old friend into the castle.
And here's the proof.
SIRIUS BLACK
Brilliant! And -- as usual --
dead wrong. Now give us our wands
back. Remus and I have a bit of
unfinished business to tend to.
As Black approaches, Snape puts his wand to Black's neck.
SNAPE
 Give me a reason. I beg you.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Don't be a fool, Severus!
(CONTINUED)
96.
114 CONTINUED: (4) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
He can't help it. It's habit by
now.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Quiet, Sirius!
SNAPE
(clucking his tongue)
Listen to you two. Quarreling
like an old married couple. The
creature and the criminal.
SIRIUS BLACK
Piss off.
SNAPE
Witty as ever I see. Tell me,
will you be so irreverent when I
turn you over to the Dementors?
(as Black reacts)
Do I detect a flicker of fear?
One can only imagine what it must
be like to endure the Dementor's
Kiss. It's said to be unbearable
to witness. But I'll do my best.
Snape's eyes harden. He gestures to the door.
SNAPE
After you.
As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table
where Lupin has left Harry's wand. In a flash, it's in
his hand.
HARRY
Expelliarmus!
Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a THUD, and
slides down. Ron and Hermione stare in shock.
HERMIONE
You attacked a teacher.
Harry.
Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black.
HARRY
You said Peter before. Peter who?
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Pettigrew. He was at school with
us. We thought he was a friend.

114 CONTINUED: (5) 114
HARRY
He killed
No. Pettigrew's dead.

As Harry points at Black, Black laughs mirthlessly.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I thought so, too. Until you
mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the
Map.
 HARRY
The Map was lying then --
SIRIUS BLACK
The Map never lies. Pettigrew's
alive. And he's right there.
Black points at... Ron. Ron goes white with fear.
RON
M-me? It's lunatic...
SIRIUS BLACK
Not you, you idiot. Your rat.
RON
Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my
family for --
SIRIUS BLACK
(bitterly)
Twelve years. A curiously long
life for a common garden rat.
He's missing a toe, isn't he?
Black unfolds a dog-eared clipping from The Daily
Prophet: it shows Ron in Egypt with his family, Scabbers
on his shoulder.
RON
So what?
HARRY
All they could find of Pettigrew
was his --
SIRIUS BLACK
Finger. Dirty coward cut it off
so everyone would think he was
dead. Then he transformed into a
rat.
(CONTINUED)
98.
114 CONTINUED: (6) 114
Harry stares into Black's sunken eyes. Wanting to
believe. Desperate to believe. Glances at Ron, his
agonized face. Scabbers SQUIRMS VIOLENTLY.
HARRY
Show me.
Lupin and Black turn to Ron. He holds Scabbers
protectively.
RON
What are you going to do to him?
Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance.
SIRIUS BLACK
Together.
With that, Lupin takes out his wand and, as one, he and
Black cast a stream of BLUE-WHITE LIGHT. Scabbers twists
madly in midair, then -- FLASH! -- transforms into... a
very short man with thinning hair and grubby hands.
PETER PETTIGREW.
PETTIGREW
S-Sirius... R-Remus. My old
friends.
Neither speaks. Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dart
toward the windows and door. Suddenly, he makes a
break for it, but Sirius merely shoves him back.
Pettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry. His
hands flutter nervously, reveal a MISSING INDEX FINGER.
PETTIGREW
Harry! Look at you! Y-you look
just like your father. Like
James. We were the best of
friends, he and I --
SIRIUS BLACK
Shut up!
PETTIGREW
I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord,
you have no idea the weapons he
possesses! Ask yourself what you
would have done, Sirius. What
 would you have done!
(CONTINUED)
99.
114 CONTINUED: (7) 114
SIRIUS BLACK
Died! Died rather than betray my
friends! And you should have
realized, Peter, if Voldemort
didn't kill you...
PROFESSOR LUPIN
We would.
PETTIGREW
No... please... you can't...
(eyes darting,
finding)
Ron! Haven't I been a good
friend? A good pet? You won't
let them kill me, will you? I was
your rat...
Ron draws back in disgust. Pettigrew turns to Hermione.
PETTIGREW
Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
you won't let them...
As one, Lupin and Black raise their wands, point them
directly into Pettigrew's face. He shrinks back
trembling, closing his eyes in fear, when...
HARRY
No.
Pettigrew's lids lift. Lupin and Black turn. Staggered.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Harry, this man...
HARRY
 I know what he is. But we'll take
him to the castle.
PETTIGREW
Bless you, boy! Bless you --
HARRY
Get off! I said we'd take you to
the castle. After that, the
Dementors can have you.

117 EXT. WHOMPING WILLOW - NIGHT (LATER) 117
As Pettigrew emerges from the gap, he prattles
desperately:
PETTIGREW
Turn me into a maggot. A dung
beetle. A Flobberworm! Anything
but the Dementors...
(as Ron emerges)
Ron! Haven't I been a good
friend? A good pet? You won't
let them kill me, will you? I was
your rat...
As Ron draws back in disgust, a sleepwalking Snape BUMPS
his head against a low limb. Hermione turns to Harry.
HERMIONE
Don't worry. He's under the
Somnambulist Charm. It's
primarily used to transport the
seriously deranged.
 As Harry nods, Pettigrew's pleading eyes find Hermione.
PETTIGREW
Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely
you won't let them...
Hermione tugs her robes from Pettigrew's sweaty grasp.
Harry turns, sees Black staring in wonder at the castle,
shining radiantly under the bright bowl of the night sky.
SIRIUS BLACK
Beautiful, isn't it? I'll never
forget the first time I walked
through those doors. It'll be
nice to do it again. Freely.
(turning to Harry)
That was a noble thing you did
back there. He doesn't deserve
it.
Harry studies Pettigrew briefly, looks away. Lost in
thought.
HARRY
I don't reckon my father'd want
his best friends to become killers
for a worthless piece of vermin
like Pettigrew. Besides: Dead,
the truth dies with him. Alive...
you're free.
(CONTINUED)
101.
117 CONTINUED: 117
Sirius studies Harry's profile, moved by this.
SIRIUS BLACK
I don't know if you know, Harry,
but when you were born, James and
Lily made me your guardian...
HARRY
I know.
 SIRIUS BLACK
And, well, I'll understand if you
choose to stay with your aunt and
uncle, but, so you know, you
could --
HARRY
When!
Come live with you?
SIRIUS BLACK
Soon as my name's cleared...
Harry looks at Hogwarts. GRINS. Sirius does the same.
Then, Hermione's voice rises on the air, quavering with
fear.
HERMIONE
Harry...
He turns, see Hermione staring at the FULL MOON. His
eyes shift. Lupin is a rigid silhouette, his fingers
twitching.
SIRIUS BLACK
Remus, old friend... did you take
your potion tonight?
Lupin, twitching, SHAKES HIS HEAD. Pettigrew's eyes
dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift, note
the WAND trembling in LUPIN'S LENGTHENING FIST.
SIRIUS BLACK
Run. All of you. Now.
But none of them do, transfixed, watching as BRISTLES
POKE THROUGH LUPIN'S SKIN. Black steps forward, wraps
his arms around his friend, presses his mouth to his ear.
SIRIUS BLACK
You know the man you truly are,
Remus. This flesh is only flesh.

SIRIUS BLACK (CONT'Dpounding Lupin's
chest)
This heart is where you truly
live. This heart! Here!
As Lupin's WAND DROPS... Pettigrew LEAPS.
HARRY
No!
(flashing his wand)
Expelliarmus!
Lupin's wand flies from Pettigrew's hand and he FREEZES.
Then slowly turns. Face blank, eyes closed, he... GRINS
HIDEOUSLY. Transforms. Stunned, Harry watches a RAT
dart into the night.
A HOWL PIERCES THE AIR and Harry wheels. With a shrug,
Lupin tosses Black into the air, then turns. He is no
longer human. He's a werewolf. Harry and Hermione begin
to edge back.
HERMIONE
Professor...?
The WEREWOLF'S eyes blaze. Long teeth glitter. Then...
a horrifying GROWL ERUPTS from its throat. Harry and
Hermione spin, begin to flee... and run flat into Snape.
As they collapse in a great clumsy pile, Snape's eyes
flutter open, the spell broken. Seeing Hermione atop
him, he sweeps her aside...
SNAPE
Out of the way!
... and finds the werewolf preparing to pounce. Leaping
to his feet, Snape draws his wand and steps forward,
shielding Hermione, Harry and Ron.
The WEREWOLF HOWLS, SPRINTS forward, when -- SWOOSH! -- a
GIANT DOG (Black) intercepts it in MIDAIR. They hit the
ground in a FIERCE TANGLE of FLASHING TEETH, a single
horrible flailing beast. Again and again, the dog pushes
the werewolf back, but the werewolf is too strong...
HARRY
Sirius!
The DOG YELPS, ROARS in pain, and the werewolf flings it
into the tall grass. As it charges after, Harry pushes
past Snape, dashes into the night. Hermione makes to
follow, but Snape holds her back.
(CONTINUED)
103.
117 CONTINUED: (3) 117
HERMIONE
Harry!
Harry runs full out. Up ahead, FRAMED AGAINST A FULL
MOON, he spies the dog, lying inert, the werewolf's
razor-sharp claws suspended over its neck.
HARRY
NO!!!
Desperately, Harry plucks a THICK BRANCH from the ground
and hurls it with all his might. Bull's-eye. The
werewolf freezes. Turns. Begins to move toward...
Harry.
Harry draws his wand, terrified, but tormented as well,
knowing Lupin dwells somewhere within the beast.
HARRY
Please, Professor. Stop... It's
me.
Suddenly... a HOWL pierces the night.
The werewolf falters, cocking its head toward the forest.
Harry waits, petrified. The WEREWOLF's eyes shift back
to him. It SNARLS, moves closer, ready to kill. Harry
covers his face with his arm, when...
... a SECOND HOWL ECHOES high above the forest. Slowly,
Harry drops his arm. Looks. The werewolf bounds toward
the forest, vanishes. Harry's eyes shift. In the
darkness, the wounded dog lurches through the tall grass.
Falls. Rises. Falls again. Each time becoming more
human. As he disappears over the ridge, Harry sprints
after.
117A EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 117A
Harry stumbles down to Black, who lies on the water's
edge, now fully a man, arms and face gleaming with
lacerations.
HARRY
Sirius!
Harry looks into his glassy eyes.
HARRY
Sirius!
(CONTINUED)
104.
117A CONTINUED: 117A
A fragile MIST escapes Harry's mouth. A raw WIND TOSSES
his hair. CHILL-BUMPS pebble his SKIN. A FRINGE of ICE
appears at the lake's edge. Then they appear, oozing
like smoke through the TREES across the lake. Dementors.
HARRY
No... No!
(drawing his wand)
Expecto... Patronum!
A thin silvery wisp weeps from Harry's wand, hovering
like a VEIL, but the Dementors continue to come. Harry
places his hand on Black's HEAVING HEART, poises his wand
once more:
HARRY
Expecto... Patronum...
Harry's Patronus blooms briefly... and dies. Harry's
eyes flutter, the DEMENTORS twisting madly in his vision,
drawing closer. Black GASPS. SILVERY FEATHERS of LIGHT
tumble from his lips, as if his very soul were leaving
him...
Then... a LIGHT splinters the trees. Harry squints, sees
a FIERY STAG appear... its body luminous... slashing
through the trees... sowing light in the darkness. The
Dementors wilt in its wake, but more replace them,
sweeping down in waves. Still, the stag charges on. The
LIGHT EXPANDS. The forest blazing with it. The remaining
Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash.
The light ebbs. The stag's luminous body flickers.
There is a BRIGHT FLASH and darkness returns, a single
THREAD of LIGHT all that remains, spinning down to the
 size of a PEARL... in the palm of MAN, standing deep in
the trees. Harry studies the strangely familiar
SILHOUETTE, then... it is gone.
Silence drops like a curtain. MIST rises from the lake.
As Snape appears at the top of the rise, we --
FADE TO BLACK.
FADE IN:
118 INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT (LATER) 118
CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY... out of HERMIONE'S SHADOW,
which ripples against the curtain that encircles Harry's
bed. A HAND reaches out -- Harry's hand -- and sweeps
the CURTAIN ASIDE. Ron lies opposite, his leg BANDAGED.
Hermione paces. Stops.

118 CONTINUED: 118
HERMIONE
Harry --
HARRY
I saw my dad.
HERMIONE
What...?
HARRY
He sent the Dementors away... I
saw him. Across the lake...
Hermione exchanges a private glance with Ron, turns back.
HERMIONE
 Listen, Harry. They've captured
Sirius. Any minute the Dementors
are going to perform the Kiss.
HARRY
The Kiss...?
HERMIONE
It's what Dementors do to those
they want to destroy. They clamp
their jaws over the victim's mouth
and... suck out his soul.
HARRY
You mean, they're going to kill
Sirius?
HERMIONE
No. It's worse. Much worse. You
go on living. But you have no
memory. No sense of self. You're
just a shall. An empty shell...
As Harry reacts, the door opens and Dumbledore enters.
HERMIONE
Headmaster! You've got to stop
them! They've got the wrong man!
HARRY
It's true, sir. Sirius is
innocent --
RON
It's Scabbers who did it!

Well, he was a rat. You

Percy's --
HERMIONE
The point is... we know the truth.
Please, sir, you must believe us.
DUMBLEDORE
I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry
to say the word of three thirteen-
year-old wizards will convince few
others. A child's voice, however
honest and true, is meaningless to
those who have forgotten how to
listen.
As Dumbledore turns to the window, a SHOOTING STAR
plummets silently through the sky.
DUMBLEDORE
Ah... a shooting star. If ever
one was to make a wish, now would
be the time. But time, I'm
afraid, is precisely our
problem...
On cue, the MIDNIGHT BELL begins to CHIME... DING!...
DING!
DUMBLEDORE
Mysterious thing, time. Powerful.
And, when meddled with...
dangerous. Sirius Black is in the
topmost cell of the Dark Tower.
(to Hermione)
You know the laws, Miss Granger.
You must not be seen. And you
would, I feel, do well to return
before this last chime. If not...
well, the consequences are really
too ghastly to discuss. Three
turns should do it, I think. If
you succeed, more than one
innocent life may be spared
tonight.

Dumbledore hands Harry and Hermione each a stick of
CHOCOLATE, then starts to go... stops.
DUMBLEDORE
By the way, when in doubt, I find
retracing my steps to be a wise
place to begin... Good luck.
He smiles, exits. Harry glances curiously at the
chocolate.
RON
What in bloody hell was all that
about?
But Hermione doesn't reply, instead looping the pendant's
long chain around Harry's neck as well as her own.
HERMIONE
Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you
can't walk...
As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the BELL
continues to CHIME -- DING! DING! -- and...
119 INT. HOSPITAL WING - TIME REVERSAL - NIGHT/LATE 119
AFTERNOON
TIME REVERSES in a dizzying backward blur, as if a tape
were being rewound, every moment that occurred in the
hospital room flickering by at a dizzying speed while,
outside the window, darkness gives way to dusk and the
sun "un-sets," returning to its place low on the horizon.
At this point, the TIME REVERSAL ends and the room is...
Empty. Except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione
unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion.
HARRY
What just happened? Where's Ron?
Hermione ignores the question, eyes the CLOCK on the
wall.
HERMIONE
Seven-thirty. Where were we at
seven-thirty?
HARRY
Huh? Dunno... going to Hagrid's?

Harry and Hermione come to a mad, huffing halt.
HARRY
Hermione! Will you please tell me
what it is we're doing?!
She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry
follows her gaze and BLINKS in DISBELIEF. Across the
grounds...
124 EXT. SUNDIAL GARDEN - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON 124
... he sees himself, along with Hermione and Ron, about
to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths.
HARRY
But that... that's... us. This is
not... normal.
INTERCUT BETWEEN BRIDGE AND SUNDIAL GARDEN.
Dumbfounded, Harry turns. Hermione holds up the HOURGLASS.
HERMIONE
This is a Time-Turner, Harry.
McGonagall gave it to me first
term. This is how I've been
getting to my lessons all year.
HARRY
You mean, we've gone back in time?
HERMIONE
Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to
return to this moment. Clearly
something happened he wants us to
change.

A soft SMACK is HEARD. They turn, see Malfoy land on
the seat of his pants in the Sundial Garden, rub his
 kisser.
HARRY

Good punch.
HERMIONE
Hurry! Malfoy's coming!
Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge. Seconds later,
FOOTSTEPS CLAMOR over their heads.
DRACO (O.S.)
Not a word of this to anyone,
understood! I'll get that jumped-
up Mudblood one of these days.
Mark my words...
Eyes narrowed in anger, Hermione leans out, reaches up,
and sends Malfoy SPRAWLING. As Harry pulls her back,
Malfoy looks around in confusion, then dashes off with
the others.
Seconds later, Harry emerges, marvels at the sight
of himself and Hermione, and Ron heading down the
slope to Hagrid's hut. His eyes shift to the pumpkin
patch.
HARRY
Look. Buckbeak's still alive.
HERMIONE
Of course! Remember what
Dumbledore said. If we succeed,
more than one innocent life could
be spared.
HARRY
Buckbeak? But... how will saving
Buckbeak help Sirius?
HERMIONE
We'll see.
125 EXT. HAGRID'S HUT - PUMPKIN PATCH - LATE AFTERNOON/DUSK 125
As Buckbeak feasts on a ferret, Harry and Hermione duck
behind a pile of pumpkins. Peering into the hut, Harry
sees Hermione and Ron embrace awkwardly.

He grins, turns, only to find Hermione analyzing the
moment with considerable fascination. Caught -- regards
Harry defensively.
HERMIONE
What?
HARRY
Nothing.
Harry looks toward the slope, sees Fudge and the others
approaching in a CLOUD of CROWS.
HARRY
Here they come. I better hurry.
HERMIONE
No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak
before we steal him. Otherwise,
he'll think Hagrid set him free!
Harry nods, then looks toward the hut. Inside, Hagrid is
handing Scabbers to Ron.
HARRY
That's Pettigrew --
As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him, speaks
fiercely.
HERMIONE
No, Harry! You can't!
HARRY
Hermione, that's the man who
betrayed my parents! You don't
expect me to just sit here...
 HERMIONE
Yes! You Must!
(pointing inside)
Harry, you're in Hagrid's hut
right now. If you go bursting
inside, you'll think you've gone
mad. Awful things can happen when
wizards meddle with time. We
can't be seen.
Hermione turns, watches Fudge and the others drawing
closer. She frowns, glances into the hut.

HERMIONE
Fudge is coming and... we're not
leaving... why aren't we leaving?
Just then... on the ground beside her... Hermione notices
a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE. Instantly, she grabs it,
rises, and hurls it through the OPEN WINDOW. SMASH! The
sound of a GLASS JAR SHATTERING is heard within the hut.
HARRY
Are you mad?
Hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone
through the window and -- CONK! -- off the back of
Harry's head.
HARRY
That hurt.
HERMIONE
Sorry.
Crows begin to drop atop the roof. Fudge's party
arrives, RAPS on the door.
HERMIONE
C'mon. Any minute now we're going
to be coming out the back door.
Quickly, Hermione and Harry dash into the trees directly
behind... just in time to see themselves -- along with
Ron -- exit the back door and slip behind the pumpkin
pile where, only seconds before, they were hiding. As
Fudge appears at the window and picks his nose as before,
Hermione ponders the back of her own head.
HERMIONE
Is that really what my hair looks
like from the back?
HARRY
Shhh!
Hermione sees herself turn. Ducking, she accidentally
stirs the branches, then peeks out and sees herself
staring curiously at the branches DANCING ODDLY. Next
she hears her own voice:
HERMIONE (O.S.)
Nothing, I just thought I saw...
Never mind.

Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope.
The coast clear, they slip out of the trees.
HERMIONE
Now, Harry!
As Harry vaults into the patch, the CROWS STIR, CAWING at
his ankles, pecking at his feet.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'It is the decision of the
Committee for the Disposal of
Dangerous Creatures that the
Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter
called the condemned, shall be
 executed this day at sundown...'
As Harry approaches, Buckbeak studies him curiously, a
ferret leg dangling from his beak. Harry bows. SLURP!
The ferret leg disappears and Buckbeak returns Harry's
nod. As Harry takes Buckbeak's chain... a flint-eyed
crow PECKS his hand.
HARRY
Get away!
Harry waves the crow away, yanks hard on Buckbeat's
chain.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'The Committee's appointed
executioner shall dispatch the
condemned by means of
beheading...'
HARRY
C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on...
Buckbeak refuses to move.
CORNELIUS FUDGE (O.S.)
'As witnessed below.' You sign
here, Hagrid. Very well,
gentlemen. Let's step outside,
shall we...
DING! The Hogwarts BELL begins to TOLL. Harry and
Hermione exchange a glance. Harry tugs harder. No go.
DUMBLEDORE (O.S.)
Excuse me, Minister. I believe I
must sign as well...
(CONTINUED)
113.
125 CONTINUED: (4) 125
Harry PULLS at the chain, straining mightily...
DING! when Hermione POPS UP, BOWS QUICKLY, and dangles a
dead ferret before Buckbeak.
HERMIONE
Here, Beaky... Come and get the
nice dead ferret... yum yum...
Harry looks at her as if she's mad, but it's... working.
As Buckbeak trots after, the CAWING CROWS scatter.
DING!
Harry and Hermione lead Buckbeak away when the back door
suddenly opens. They freeze... caught... Fudge's eyes
drifting their way, when -- as before -- Dumbledore
raises his hand and directs the attention of the others
away from Buckbeak.
DUMBLEDORE
Professor Dippet had those
blackberries planted when he was
Headmaster...
Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along, disappear into
the forest... just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Let's get this over with, shall
we?
Harry and Hermione -- their view unobstructed by the LOW
STAND OF TREES this time -- watch the Executioner
approach the pumpkin patch... and stop. Quickly, the
confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
But... where is it? I just saw
the beast not moments ago --
Hagrid?
HAGRID
Beaky...
Hearing Hagrid's husky voice, BUCKBEAK strains at his
tether, WHIMPERS eerily. Hermione tosses him another
ferret.
DUMBLEDORE
(a hint of amusement)
How extraordinary!
(CONTINUED)
114.
125 CONTINUED: (5) 125
CORNELIUS FUDGE
Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's
obviously released him.
HAGRID
Professor, I swear! I didn't!
DUMBLEDORE
I'm quite sure the Minister isn't
suggesting that you had anything
to do with it, Hagrid. How could
you? You've been with us all
along.
CORNELIUS FUDGE
We should search the grounds --
DUMBLEDORE
Search the skies if you must,
Minister. In the meantime, I
wouldn't say no to a cup of tea,
Hagrid. Or... a large brandy.
(to the Executioner)
It seems your services will no
longer be required.
The Executioner lifts his blade and -- with a brutal fury
-- plunges it into the flesh of a PUMPKIN with a
SICKENING CHOP!
The CROWS SCATTER to the skies.
126 EXT. FORBIDDEN FOREST - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 126
Harry and Hermione race through the trees as Buckbeak
lopes easily behind.
HARRY
Now what?
 HERMIONE
We save Sirius.
HARRY
And we do that... how?
HERMIONE
No idea.
127 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT WHOMPING WILLOW - DUSK 127
SUBJECTIVE POV, GLIDING THROUGH a thicket of trees, TO
the forest's edge, the trees thinning, REVEALING...
115.
127A EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT WHOMPING WILLOW - DUSK 127A
... the Whomping Willow THRASHING. Hermione disappears
down the hole, then a FIGURE approaches the tree. Lupin.
INTERCUT.
HERMIONE
Look. It's Lupin.
As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence
oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick, pokes
a knot on the trunk. Instantly, the Willow calms.
HARRY
Wait until Fred and George hear
about that one.
HERMIONE
Here comes Snape.
 As Lupin disappears into the gap at the base of the tree,
Snape makes his way down the slope.
HARRY
And now we wait.
HERMIONE
Now we wait.
127B EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT WHOMPING WILLOW - DUSK TO NIGHT 127B
(LATER)
We look UPWARD, see the tops of the trees etched against
the darkening sky. BATS fly TOWARD us. We FOLLOW one,
when Buckbeak snags one. A tail twitches briefly between
his beak, then -- SLURP! -- is gone.
HERMIONE
'Least someone's enjoying himself.
Harry and Hermione sit together in the lengthening
shadows. Harry snaps off a piece of chocolate, hands it
to Hermione.
HARRY
Hermione...
HERMIONE
Yes?
(CONTINUED)
116.
127B CONTINUED: 127B
HARRY
Before. Down by the lake. When I
was with Sirius... I did see
 someone... that someone made the
Dementors go away...
HERMIONE
With a Patronus. I heard Snape
telling Dumbledore when we were
taken to the hospital. According
to him, only a really powerful
wizard could have conjured it.
HARRY
It was my Dad.
Hermione looks at Harry.
HARRY
It was my Dad who conjured the
Patronus.
HERMIONE
But, Harry, your Dad's...
HARRY
Dead. I know. I'm just telling
you what I saw.
Hermione nods, not wanting to press Harry further, then
glances beyond the trees, toward the Whomping Willow.
HERMIONE
Here we come.
128 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT WHOMPING WILLOW - NIGHT 128
SHADOWS emerge under a FULL MOON: Black. Harry.
Pettigrew. Lupin. Hermione. Ron. Sleepwalking
Snape...
INTERCUT:
Harry studies himself and Sirius.
HARRY
You see Sirius talking to me?
He's asking me to come live with
him.
HERMIONE
Really?
(CONTINUED)
117.
128 CONTINUED: 128
Harry nods, his voice wistful.
HARRY
When we free him, I'll never have
to go back to the Dursley's. I'm
going to tell him I'd like to live
someplace in the country. I think
he'd like that, after all those
years in Azkaban. We don't need a
big place and I can help him...
A HOWL pierces the night. Hermione glances toward the
Willow.
HERMIONE
It's happened. Lupin's
transformed.
HARRY
Which means Pettigrew is slipping
safely into the night. While we
just stand here...
A FIERCE GROWLING is heard as twin silhouettes -- the DOG
and the WEREWOLF -- bound into the tall grass. Harry
watches himself appear, hurl the stick as before. The
werewolf turns, begins to stalk...
OWWWWWWWWW! Harry wheels, sees Hermione, hands cupped to
her mouth, making a loud HOWL. He covers her mouth.
HARRY
What are you doing?
HERMIONE
Saving your life.
Harry looks back to the tall grass. The werewolf is
frozen. As before, it begins to approach Harry again.
OWWWWWWWW! This time, Harry doesn't stop her.
HARRY
Thanks. But we have to move.
 HERMIONE
Why?
HARRY
Because that werewolf you just
called is running right this way.
They exchange a glance and... RUN.

130A EXT. FOREST - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
130A
Harry and Hermione dash for the lives, swing behind a
HUGE TREE. As CAMERA BEGINS TO CIRCLE, the werewolf
appears. Pauses. As it approaches the tree, Harry and
Hermione silently sidestep in the opposite direction,
until the werewolf... disappears. CAMERA CONTINUES TO
CIRCLE the tree...
HERMIONE
Buckbeak. We've got to find him.
... and REVEALS the werewolf, fifteen feet past, waiting.
As Harry and Hermione step out, they freeze. The
werewolf poises itself, preparing to pounce, when...
SKREEEK! The TREES shake with the fury of a HURRICANE
and Buckbeak charges into the clearing, screening Harry
and Hermione. The WEREWOLF SNARLS ANGRILY, makes to
charge. With lightning-fast reflexes, Buckbeak's claws
slash the air... only inches from the werewolf's face.
The werewolf stops, eyes glittering with rage, then...
HOWLS. Turning, it vanishes into the forest.
HERMIONE
Poor Professor Lupin is having a
 really tough night...
Just then, a CHILL WIND rises...
The LEAVES of the trees TREMBLE...
EERIE SHADOWS flutter over the moon, greasy as smoke...
Dementors.
HARRY
Let's go.
CUT TO:
MOVING POV
Looking UPWARD... THROUGH the trees as the sky wheels by,
Dementors streaking IN AND OUT OF VIEW.
130B EXT. EDGE OF FOREST AT BLACK LAKE - NIGHT (MOMENTS
130B
LATER)
CAMERA RUSHES IN, HOLDS ON Harry and Hermione's faces.
(CONTINUED)
119.
130B CONTINUED: 130B
Shocked.
Terror-stricken.
Opposite them, across the lake...
130C EXT. BLACK LAKE - SAME TIME 130C
... a CYCLONE of DEMENTORS whirl madly above Harry and
Black.
INTERCUT BETWEEN BLACK LAKE AND EDGE OF FOREST.
Harry watches himself vainly attempt to conjure a
Patronus as the cyclone only continues to grow...
HERMIONE
This is horrible...
HARRY
Don't worry. My Dad will come...
Right there... you'll see... he'll
come... any minute... he'll
conjure the Patronus
Hermione eyes Harry warily. He is transfixed, staring
hungrily toward the outcrop. The WIND RISES. The Lake
begins to freeze. WHOOSH! WHOOSH! One after another,
Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone...
HERMIONE
No one's coming, Harry...
HARRY
HE WILL! He will come!
She looks. Nothing. Desperately, her eyes flash to the
cyclone, to the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the
water's edge... wracked with pain... dying...
HERMIONE
No one's coming! You're dying,
both of you... and no one's
coming!
Harry's face changes. A riddle unravels. He draws his
wand.
HERMIONE
HARRY, NO!
(CONTINUED)
120.
130C CONTINUED: 130C
Too late. Harry slashes through the trees, down to the
rocky outcrop, to the exact spot where his father
appeared. Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of
Dementors on the other side of the lake.
HARRY
EXPECTO PATRONUM!
A WISP of SILVER escapes his wand, hovering like a MIST,
then BLOOMS MAGNIFICENTLY. The trees EXPLODE WITH LIGHT.
The Lake BLAZES with reflected FIRE. Harry stands
utterly still, wand extended to the heavens. Across the
lake, the Dementors retreat. Harry waits, still as a
statue, until each and every one is gone.
Then he simply lets his arm drop.
131 EXT. HOGWARTS - SKY - FLYING - NIGHT (LATER) 131
WHOOSH! Harry and Hermione plunge INTO FRAME astride
Buckbeak, SOARING toward the castle. Outside the
grounds, the Dementors wait restlessly. Up ahead, Fudge
and Snape enter the Dark Tower, TORCHES in hand.
HARRY
You were right, Hermione. It
wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It
was... me. I saw myself conjuring
the Patronus before. I knew I
could do it this time, because...
because I'd already done it. Does
that make sense?
Hermione contemplates this.
HERMIONE
No.
(looking down
in fear)
But I don't like this!
132 EXT. HOGWARTS - DARK TOWER - WIDE SHOT - NIGHT (MOMENTS 132
LATER)
We see Buckbeak land.
CUT TO:
133 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT 133
Sirius paces within a SMALL CELL, a man condemned.
Spying Harry and Hermione, he stops. Stunned to see
them.
121.
134 INT. DARK TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 134
Snape, TORCH in hand, leads the way as Fudge HUFFS after.
135 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 135
Hermione pushes past Harry.
HERMIONE
Out of the way!
(raising her wand)
Alohomora!
Sirius tests the IRON DOOR. Still locked.
HERMIONE
Didn't really expect that to work.
136 EXT. DARK TOWER - STAIRWELL - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 136
Snape and Fudge draw closer...
137 EXT. DARK TOWER - TERRACE - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 137
Wand flashing, Hermione tries spell after spell.
HERMIONE
Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare!
Emancipare!
No. No. No. No.
SIRIUS BLACK
You might try --
HERMIONE
Quiet! I'm trying to think.
She resumes pacing, MUTTERING furiously. Then... stops.
Turns.
HERMIONE
BOMBARDA!
KA-BOOM! The CELL DOOR ROCKETS to the sky.
SIRIUS BLACK
That'll do.
138 EXT. SKY/HOGWARTS - HELICOPTER SHOT - NIGHT 138
We see Buckbeak spirit Harry, Hermione and Sirius off the
terrace and soar directly TOWARD us... Just as Snape and
Fudge reach the top of the Tower.
122.
139 EXT. BUCKBEAK - FLYING - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 139
Sirius laughs, hair blowing in the wind.
SIRIUS BLACK
You truly are your father's son,
Harry!
140 EXT. CLOCKTOWER COURTYARD - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 140
Black puts his hands to Hermione's waist, swings her off
Buckbeak and onto the ground next to Harry.
SIRIUS BLACK
I'll be forever grateful for this.
To both of you.
HARRY
I want to go with you.
SIRIUS BLACK
One day perhaps. For some time...
life will be too... unpredictable.
Besides, you're meant to be here.
Black claps his shoulder, looks him in the eye.
SIRIUS BLACK
But promise me something, Harry.
HARRY
Anything.
SIRIUS BLACK
Trust yourself. No matter the
challenges you face -- and I fear
they will be many -- you'll be
surprised how many times you can
find the answers...
(tapping his heart)
...here.
As Sirius climbs atop Buckbeak, a SHOOTING STAR arcs
through the heavens.
SIRIUS BLACK
A shooting star. Make a wish.
WHACK! -- Black gives Buckbeak a SLAP and they soar into
the glittering sky. Harry and Hermione stand watching,
when... DING! They wheel. Look to the Clock Tower.
HERMIONE
We have to go.
 (CONTINUED)

... the corridor. The Clock Tower BELL THUNDERS. The
DOOR OPENS. Dumbledore backs out...
DUMBLEDORE
By the way, when in doubt, I
always find retracing my steps to
be a wise place to begin... Good
luck.
As Dumbledore begins to close the door, Harry and
Hermione stumble frantically forward, the door about to
hit the jamb, when... suddenly... Dumbledore stops.
Looks up.
DUMBLEDORE
Well?
HARRY
He's free -- Sirius. We... we did
it.
DUMBLEDORE
Did what?
With a twinkle in his eye, Dumbledore swings open the
door. As Harry and Hermione enter.
145 INT. HOSPITAL WING - NIGHT (SAME TIME) 145
... they catch the faintest glimpse of... themselves...
across the room... just as they EVAPORATE. Ron blinks.
Turns. Frowns.
RON
How'd you two get over there? I
was just talking to you... over
there.
(CONTINUED)
124.
145 CONTINUED: 145
Ron glances to the other side of the room. Frowns.
Hermione glances mischievously to Harry.
HERMIONE
What d'you think, Harry? Too much
for him -- everything that's
happened tonight?
HARRY
Afraid so. Always been a bit of
the nervous type, Ron has.
Ron stares at them, confounded. Slowly, they... GRIN.
146 EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MORNING 146
The Whomping Willow sways in a light breeze. The Black
Lake shimmers, clouds drifting in its glassy mirror.
147 INT. CORRIDOR/LUPIN'S OFFICE - MORNING 147
Harry walks softly toward an OPEN DOOR -- Lupin's
office -- and peers in. Lupin stands over a battered
suitcase, filling it with the last of his books. Without
turning, he SPEAKS.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Hello, Harry.
Harry JUMPS. Lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Saw you coming.
The Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk.
Harry nods, looks back to Lupin. Unable to disguise his
shock at Lupin's appearance.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
I've looked worse, believe me.
Harry eyes the open desk drawers... the bare
bookshelves...
HARRY
You've been sacked.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Resigned, actually.
(CONTINUED)
125.
147 CONTINUED: 147
HARRY
Resigned! But why!
PROFESSOR LUPIN
It seems that someone has let slip
the nature of my condition.
HARRY
Snape.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Whoever. It was bound to get out.
This time tomorrow, the owls will
start arriving. Parents will not
want a -- someone like me --
teaching their children.
HARRY
But Dumbledore --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Has already risked enough on my
behalf. Besides, people like me,
well... let's just say I'm used to
this by now. But before I go,
tell me about your Patrons.
HARRY
Well. At first I thought it was a
horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I
think it was --
PROFESSOR LUPIN
A stag.
HARRY
Yes.
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Your father used to transform into
one. That's how he was able to
keep me company when I became...
sick. He was a great friend
James.
Lupin smiles wanly, lifts his sorry suitcase. Then
stops.
 PROFESSOR LUPIN
There are stories about him and your mother, you know.
Some are even true. But I think it's safe to say, in the
end, you'll know them best by getting to know yourself.
Lupin then -- with a wicked twinkle -- raises his wand.
(CONTINUED)
126.
147 CONTINUED: (2) 147
PROFESSOR LUPIN
Mischief managed.
Harry watches the Map go blank. Looks back. Lupin is
gone.
148 OMITTED 148
149 INT. GREAT HALL - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 149
Ron stands amid a circle of excited Gryffindors.
RON
Stand back, I said! I'll take it
upstairs if you don't settle!
As Harry arrives, he glances at Hermione, who CLEARS HER
THROAT LOUDLY. The others turn, begin all speaking at
once.
NEVILLE
Harry! Wherever did you get it!
SEAMUS
Can I have a go, Harry? After
you, of course --
RON
Quiet!
(as they oblige)
Thank you. Let the man through.
Mystified, Harry steps forward, the boys peeling away,
clearing his view of the BROOMSTICK in Ron's hands. The
LABEL GLEAMS: "FIREBOLT."
HARRY
Whose is that?
RON
(as everyone laughs)
Whose is it? It's yours, mate.
HARRY
Who?
But... how?
HERMIONE
It's a mystery. Though... this
fell out of the wrapping.
Harry turns, sees Hermione holding up a FEATHER.

BOOM! The huge vertical DOORS BURST OPEN and Harry,
trailed by the others, exits with the Firebolt. As he
strides off, others join the assembly -- Hagrid, Malfoy,
Crabbe, and Goyle among them -- curious to see what the
commotion is all about.
151 EXT. COURTYARD - DAY (MOMENTS LATER)
151
As Harry stops, an expectant HUSH hangs over the moment.
SEAMUS
Go on, Harry.
NEVILLE
Yeah. Let's see.
Harry mounts the broom. Licks his finger and jabs it in
the air. A few others do the same. Hagrid does the
same. Crabbe and Goyle start to do the same, when Malfoy
SLAPS their hands down. Finally, Harry places his hand
on the broom. Sets his grip. Takes a breath. And...
Frowns.
FRED/GEORGE
What's wrong?
HARRY
I don't think it works. I think
it's defective.
A collective GROAN. Dejected, many of the kids begin to
drift toward the castle. Harry calls after.
HARRY
Oh, come on now. It's just a
broom.
HAGRID
(nodding sagely)
Just a broom.
(CONTINUED)

151 CONTINUED: 151
Harry's eye shifts to Ron and Hermione. A wink.
HARRY
The fastest broom in the world.
As everyone turns -- WHOOSH! -- Harry JETS OFF and we --
CUT TO:
152 EXT. HIGH IN THE SKY - DAY (SAME TIME) 152
A tiny DOT, GROWING LARGER AND LARGER, races upward.
It's Harry shooting straight into the blue on the
Firebolt. A SCREAM GROWS LOUDER as he approaches. A
scream of release, of utter abandon. It's Harry
screaming. But something else is clear as he JETS PAST
and...
The SCREEN GOES BLACK.
It's a SCREAM of joy.
FADE OUT.

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire

We hone in on a snake crawling through the undergrowth.

TITLES

INT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT TIME

An old man lights a gas oven with a match, he is preparing food.
He notices a light on in the large house opposite, he stops what
he's doing and walks to the door.

OLD MAN: Bloody kids.

He leaves the house and heads towards the light.

EXT. DARKNESS

The old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch.
He opens the front door, inside is just as dark. He begins climbing
the stairs, we hear whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs.
The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is
taking place and listens on.

WORMTAIL: Oh no no no my Lord Voldemort. I only meant... perhaps if we were to do it without the boy..

VOLDEMORT: NO! The boy is everything, it cannot be done without him and it WILL be done exactly as I say.

UNKNOWN MAN: I will not disappoint you my lord.

VOLDEMORT: Good. First, gather our old comrades. Send them a sign.

A snake slithers past the old man and into the room.

VOLDEMORT: Nagini tells me the old caretaker is standing outside the door.

Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man. The old man looks terrified.

VOLDEMORT: Step aside so I can give our guest a proper greeting.

A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic.

INT. BEDROOM

HERMIONE
Harry!

Harry is flustered and still panicing.

HERMIONE
Are you alright?

HARRY
Hermione. Bad dream. When did you get
here?

HERMIONE
Just now. You?

HARRY
Last night.

Hermione goes over to Ron's bed.


HERMIONE
Wake up. Wake up Ronald!

RON
Bloody hell.

HERMIONE
Honestly. Get dressed, and don't go
back to sleep. Come on Ron! Your mother
says breakfast's ready.


EXT. GRASSLAND

HARRY
Where are we actually going?

RON
Don't know. Hey Dad! Where are we going?


ARTHUR
Haven't the foggiest, keep up!

AMOS
Arthur! It's about time son.

ARTHUR
Sorry Amos. Some of us had a bit of
a sleepy start. This is Amos Diggory
everyone, he works with me at the ministry.
And this strapping young lad must be
Cedric, am I right?

CEDRIC
Yes sir.

AMOS
Merlin's beard, you must be Harry Potter.


HARRY
Yes sir. This way.

AMOS
Great great pleasure.

They shake hands.

HARRY
Pleasure to meet you too sir.

They walk on up the hill.

ARTHUR
That's it sir, just over there.

AMOS
Shall we? We don't want to be late.


Camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside.

HARRY
Why are they all standing around that
manky old boot?

FRED
That isn't just any old manky boot mate.


GEORGE
It's a portkey.

Everyone is in a circle putting their hands on the boot.

AMOS
Time to go. Ready?

HARRY
What's a 'portkey'?

AMOS
After 3. One... Two...

ARTHUR
Harry!

Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot.

AMOS
Three!

There's a white flash and suddenly they're all flying through
the air. Everyone cheers.

ARTHUR
Let go kids!

HERMIONE
What??

ARTHUR
Let! Go!

Harry, Hermione and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with
a thump. Arthur, Amos and Cedric come down more gracefully.


ARTHUR
I bet that cleared your sinuses eh?


Cedric helps Harry to his feet.

HARRY
Thanks.

They walk across the field and we see there's a massive crowd
gathered and cheering, tents are set up all over.

ARTHUR
Well kids, welcome to the Quidditch
World Cup!

They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights. Music is playing
and people fly about overhead on brooms. They approach a small
tent.

AMOS
Parting of the waves I think old chap,
see you at the match.

Amos and Cedric separate and walk off.

HARRY
See ya later Cedric.

ARTHUR
Home sweet home.


INT. TENT

They enter the tent, the inside is many times bigger than the
outside.

ARTHUR
Girls. Choose a bunk and unpack. Ron,
get out of the kitchen we're all hungry.


TWINS
Yeah get out of the kitchen Ron.

ARTHUR
Feet off the table.

TWINS
Feet off the table.

They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon
as Arthur has walked past.

HARRY
(Smiling) I love magic.


EXT. HILLSIDE

We pan up the hillside onto a large stadium which seems to have
a huge number of floors.

INT. STADIUM

The Weasleys and Harry are finding their seats.

RON
Blimey Dad, how far up ARE we?

Lucius Malfoy and Draco are walking below them.

LUCIUS
Well put it this way, if it rains...
you'll be the first to know

DRACO
Father and I are in the minister's box,
by personal invitation of Cornelius
Fudge himself.

LUCIUS
Don't boast Draco. There's no need with
these people. Do enjoy yourself won't
you. While you can.

The ceremonies begin. Balloons fly and fireworks go off.

ARTHUR
Come on up, take your seats. I told
you these seats would be worth waiting
for.

GEORGE
Come on!

FRED
It's the Irish!

Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms
leaving a colored trail behind them. A glittering leprechaun
appears in the sky and starts dancing. Everyone is excited.


GEORGE
Here come the Bulgarians!

Five red figures this time, one of them performs a stunt on his
broom. One of them appears on the large screen. The crowd begins
to chant 'Krum, Krum, Krum'.

WEASLEYS
Krum!!!

GEORGE
Yes!

Viktor Krum waves to the crowd.

ANNOUNCER
Good evening! It gives me great pleasure
to welcome each and every one of you
to the final of the 422nd Quidditch
World Cup. Let the match begin!


INT. TENT

RON
There's no one like Krum. He's like
a bird the way he rides the wind. He's
more than an athlete, he's an artist.


The twins are bumbling about in a comical way muttering 'KRUMMMM'.


GINNY
Think you're in love Ron?

TWINS
(Singing) Viktor I love you! Viktor
I do!

Harry joins in.

BOYS
When we're apart my heart beats only
for youuu!

FRED
Sounds like the irish have got their
pride on.

ARTHUR
Stop! Stop it. It's not the irish. We've
gotta get out of here. Now.


EXT. OUTSIDE THE TENT

ARTHUR
Get back to the portkey everybody, and
stick together. Fred, George... Ginny
is your responsibility.

Some figures in pointed hoods carrying flaming torches are walking
across the campsite chanting ominous noises. The crowd is paniced
and rushing all over. Harry is trampled unconscious.


EXT. OUTSIDE - TIME PASSED

The crowds have all gone. A man walks through the rubble kicking
at things. He casts a spell which causes a bright flash and a
large ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from
it. The man grins evilly, clearly demented. Harry stirs and witnesses
the man standing there. Harry runs. The familiar voices of Ron
and Hermione are calling for him.

RON
Been looking for you for ages. Thought
we lost you.

HARRY
What is THAT?

They look at the monstrous thing in the sky, Harry holds his
head in pain. Suddenly they are fired on.

ARTHUR
Stop! That's my son.

Arthur and others approach.

ARTHUR
Ron, Harry, Hermione are you alright?


BARTY
Which of you conjured this?

ARTHUR
You can't possibly..

BARTY
Do not lie! You have been discovered
at the scene of the crime!

HARRY
Crime?

ARTHUR
Barty, they're just kids.

HARRY
What crime?

HERMIONE
Harry it's his mark.

HARRY
Those people tonight, in the masks...
they're his too aren't they? they're
his followers.

BARTY
Follow me.

HARRY
There was a man. Before. There.

BARTY
All of you, this way.

ARTHUR
Harry, who?

HARRY
I dunno. I didn't see his face.


INT. TRAIN CARRIAGE

Harry, Ron and Hermione are seated on a train. A voice calls
out.

LADY OFFSCREEN
Anything from the trolley? Anything
from the trolley?

The lady appears at their door.

LADY
Anything from the trolley dears?

RON
Packet of drewbals and a liquorice wand.


Ron sees he hasn't enough money.

RON
On second thought, just the drewbals.


HARRY
It's alright I'll get it.

RON
Just the drewbals, thanks.

Cho Chan walks up to the trolley.

CHO
Two pumpkin pasties please.

Harry and Cho look at each other and smile.

CHO
Thank you.

LADY
Anything sweet for you dear?

HARRY
Oh no thank you I'm not hungry.

HERMIONE
This is horrible, how can the ministry
not know who conjured it. Isn't there
any security or?

RON
Loads according to Dad, that's what
worried them so much. Happened right
under their noses.

Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head.

HERMIONE
It's hurting again isn't it, your scar.


HARRY
I'm fine.

HERMIONE
You know Sirius will want to hear about
this. What you saw at the world cup,
and the dream.

Harry has written a letter, he marks Sirius Black on an envelope
and gives it to an owl.


EXT. HOGWARTS

We see four flying horses flying through the air pulling a carriage
coming in to land at Hogwarts. The crowds cheer.

HAGRID
Clear the runway.

HARRY
Well there's something you don't see
every day.

A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too.


DUMBLEDORE
Now we're all settled in and sorted,
I'd like to make an announcement. This
castle will not only be your home this
year but home to some very special guests
as well. You see Hogwarts has been choosen...


A man runs up the aisle limping in a comical way, he whispers
something to Dumbledore and leaves in the same fashion.

DUMBLEDORE
So Hogwarts has been choosen to host
a legendary event. The Tri-Wizard tournament.
Now for those of you who do not know,
the tri-wizard tournament brings together
three schools for a series of magical
contests. From each school a single
contestant is selected to compete. Now
let me be clear, if choosen you stand
alone. And trust me when I say these
contests are not for the faint hearted,
but more of that later. For now please
join me in welcoming the lovely ladies
of the Beauxbatons Academy of magic
and their headmistress Madam Maxime.


A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release
butterflies into the air. They bow and everyone applauds.

STUDENT
Blimey, that's one big woman.

DUMBLEDORE
And now our friends from the north,
please greet the proud sons of Durmstrang
and the high master Igor Karkaroff.


A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs,
twirling them around and periodically stabbing them into the
ground with a spark effect.

RON
Blimey it's him, Viktor Krum!

The boys breathe some fire.

IGOR
Albus!

DUMBLEDORE
Igor.

They embrace.


EXT. HOGWARTS - STORMY - NIGHT

MADAME MAXIME
Professor Dumbledore, my horses have
travelled a long way. They will need
attending to.

DUMBLEDORE
Not to worry Madame Maxime, our gamekeeper
Hagrid's more than capable of seeing
to them.

MADAME MAXIME
But you know Monsieur Hagrid, they drink
only single malt whiskey.

The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork
into his hand.

MAN
You idiot!


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
Your attention please! I would like
to say a few words. Eternal glory, that
is what awaits the student who wins
the tri-wizard tournament. But to do
this that student must survive three
tasks. Three extremely dangerous tasks.


FRED
Wicked.

DUMBLEDORE
For this reason the ministry has seen
fit to impose a new rule. To explain
all this we have the head of the department
of international magic cooperation Mister
Bartimus Crouch.

Thunder roars overhead, rain begins leaking through the roof
and screams break out. A strange man stands in the doorway, he
casts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored.


RON
Bloody hell, it's Mad-Eye Moody.

HERMIONE
Alastor Moody? The aura.

RON
He was a catcher. Half the cells in
Azkaban are full thanks to him. He's
supposed to be mad as a hatter though
these days.

This character enters the room and begins walking. We see Harry
through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as he
goes.

DUMBLEDORE
My dear old friend, thanks for coming.


MAD-EYE
That stupid roof.

Mad-Eye takes a drink.

PUPIL
What's that he's drinking do you suppose?


HARRY
I don't know but I don't think it's
Pumpkin Juice.

BARTY
After much deliberation the ministry
has concluded that for their own safety
no student under the age of seventeen
shall be allowed to put forth their
name for the tri-wizard tournament.
This decision is final.

The crowd is unsettled, people are booing.

GEORGE
That's rubbish! You don't know what
you're doing!

DUMBLEDORE
Silence!

Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing
a blue flame.

DUMBLEDORE
The goblet of fire. Anyone wishing to
submit themselves for the tournament
merely write their name upon a piece
of parchment and throw it in the flame
before this hour on Thursday night.
Do not do so lightly, if choosen there's
no turning back. As from this moment
the tri-wizard tournament has begun.



INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

We see a suspicious character enter the room where the goblet
is still burning and close the door behind him.


INT. CLASSROOM

MAD-EYE
Alastor Moody.

He writes his name on the board.

MAD-EYE
Ministry malcontent. And your new defence
against the dark arts teacher. I'm here
because Dumbledore asked me, end of
story, goodbye, the end. Any questions?
When it comes to the dark arts, I believe
in a practical approach. But first,
which of you can tell me how many unforgivable
curses there are?

HERMIONE
Three sir.

MAD-EYE
And they are so named?

HERMIONE
Because they are unforgivable. Use of
any one of them will...

MAD-EYE
Will earn you a one way ticket to Azkaban.
Correct. Now the ministry says you're
too young to see what these curses do.
I say different! You need to know what
you're up against, you need to be prepared,
you need to find somewhere else to put
your chewing gum other than the underside
of your desk Mr Finnigan!

PUPIL
Aw no way, the old codger can see out
the back of his head.

Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger.

MAD-EYE
So, which curse shall we see first?
WEASLEY!

RON
Yes...

MAD-EYE
Give us a curse.

RON
Well, my dad did tell me about one...
The imperious curse.

MAD-EYE
Ahhh yes, your father would know all
about that. Gave the ministry quite
a bit of grief a few years ago. Perhaps
this will show you why.

Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it.

MAD-EYE
Hello. What a little beauty.

He uses his wand to send it around the class.

MAD-EYE
Don't worry. Completely harmless.

The class is unsettled.

MAD-EYE
But if she bites... she's lethal!

Draco laughs.

MAD-EYE
What are you laughing at?

Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face.

MAD-EYE
Talented isn't she? What shall I have
her do next? Jump out the window? Drown
herself?

Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling.


MAD-EYE
Scores of witches and wizards have claimed
that they only do did you-know-whose
bidding under the influence of the imperious
curse. But here's the rub, how do we
sort out the liars? Another.. another..
Come on come on. Longbottom is it? Up.


Neville Longbottom stands.

MAD-EYE
Professor Sprout tells me you have an
aptitude for herbology.

NEVILLE
There's the um... The cruciatus curse.


MAD-EYE
Correct! Correct! come come. Particularly
nasty. The torture curse.

Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals.


HERMIONE
Stop it! Can't you see it's bothering
him, stop it!

Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider
which is still making a noise.

MAD-EYE
Perhaps you could give us the last unforgivable
curse Miss Granger.

Hermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates.


MAD-EYE
The killing curse. Only one person is
known to have survived it. And he's
sitting in this room.

He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink.


INT. STAIRS

RON
Brilliant isn't he! Completely demented
of course. Terrifying to be in the same
room with, he's really BEEN there you
know.

HERMIONE
There's a reason those curses are unforgivable,
and to perform them in a classroom.
I mean did you see Neville's face.


They see a boy on the stairs facing the window.

HERMIONE
Neville?

Mad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder.

MAD-EYE
Son. You alright?

Neville nods.

MAD-EYE
Come on, we'll have a cup of tea. I
want to show you something.


INT. GOBLET ROOM

Older students are placing their names into the flame and others
are applauding, Cedric is one of them.

RON
Eternal glory, be brilliant wouldn't
it? In three years from now we'll be
old enough to be choosen.

HARRY
Yeah well rather you than me.

The twins come up cheering.

GEORGE
Thank you thank you, well lads we've
done it.

FRED
Cooked it up just this morning.

HERMIONE
It's not going to work.

FRED
Oh yeah? And why's that Granger.

HERMIONE
You see this? This is an age line. Dumbledore
drew it himself.

FRED
So?

HERMIONE
So a genius like Dumbledore couldn't
possibly be fooled by something pathetically
dimwitted such as an age potion.

GEORGE
That's why it's so brilliant.

GEORGE
Ready Fred?

FRED
Ready George?

They jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names
in the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're
flung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have
full heads of grey hair and beards.

GEORGE
You said..

Fred You said..

They roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer. The
room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts
his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles.



INT. GOBLET ROOM - THURSDAY NIGHT

DUMBLEDORE
Sit down please. And now the moment
you've all been waiting for, the champions
selection!

Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name
comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously.

DUMBLEDORE
The Durmstrang champion is ... Viktor
Krum!

The Durmstrang crowd cheer. Another name comes out.

DUMBLEDORE
The champion from Beauxbatons... Fleur
Delacour

The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes
out.

DUMBLEDORE
The Hogwarts champion... Cedric Diggory.


Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage.

DUMBLEDORE
Excellent! we now have our three champions!
But in the end only one will go down
in history. Only one will hoist this
chalice of champions, this vessel of
victory the tri-wizard cup!

People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another
name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads...

DUMBLEDORE
Harry Potter. Harry Potter?

HAGRID
No... No.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry Potter!

HERMIONE
Go on Harry. Harry for goodness sake.


Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Voices
in the crowd shout out.

VOICE
He's a cheat! He's not even seventeen
yet.


INT. ROOM

Harry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts
in and grabs Harry.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry! Did you put your name in the
goblet of fire?

HARRY
No sir.

DUMBLEDORE
Did you ask one of the older students
to do it for you?

HARRY
No sir.

DUMBLEDORE
You're absolutely sure?

HARRY
Yes sir.

MADAME MAXIME
Well of course he is lying.

MAD-EYE
The hell he is. The goblet of fire is
an exceptionally powerful magical object,
only an exceptionally powerful conjurer
could have hoodwinked it. Magic way
beyond the talents of a fourth year.


IGOR
You seem to have given this a fair bit
of thought Mad-Eye.

MAD-EYE
It was once my job to think as dark
wizards do Karkaroff perhaps you remember?


DUMBLEDORE
That doesn't help Alastor. Leave this
to you Barty.

BARTY
The rules are absolute, the goblet of
fire constitutes a binding magical contract.
Mr Potter has no choice, he is as of
tonight... a tri-wizards champion.



INT. DARKENED TOWER ROOM

MCGONAGALL
This can't go on Albus. First the dark
mark, now this?

DUMBLEDORE
What do you suggest Minerva?

MCGONAGALL
Put an end to it. Don't let Potter compete.


DUMBLEDORE
You heard Barty the rules are clear.


MCGONAGALL
Well the devil with Barty and his rules.
And since when did you accomodate them...


SEVERUS
Master I too find it difficult to believe
this mere coincidence, if we are to
truly discover the meaning of these
events perhaps we should for the time
being let them unfold.

MCGONAGALL
Do nothing?? Offer him up as bait? Potter
is a boy not a piece of meat.

DUMBLEDORE
I agree with Severus. Alastor, keep
an eye on Harry will you?

MAD-EYE
I can do that.

DUMBLEDORE
Don't let him know though, he must be
anxious enough as it is... knowing what
lies ahead. Then again, we all are.



INT. BEDROOM

RON
How did you do it?

Harry is silent.

RON
Never mind. Doesn't matter. You could
have let your best friend know though.


HARRY
Let you know what?

RON
You know bloody well what.

HARRY
I didn't ask for this to happen Ron.
Okay? You're being stupid.

RON
Yeah that's me, Ron Weasley... Harry
Potter's stupid friend.

HARRY
I didn't put my name in that cup. I
don't WANT eternal glory I just wanna
be.. Look, I don't know what happened
tonight and I don't know why, it just
did ok.

RON
Piss off.


INT. HOGWARTS

A woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well groomed and dressed
colorfully.

RITA
What a charismatic quartet. Hello!


The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group.
She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands.

RITA
I'm Rita Skeeter, I write for the daily
prophet. But of course you know that
don't you. It's you we don't know, you're
the news. What quirks lurk beneath those
rosy cheeks? what mysteries do the muscles
mask? does courage lie beneath those
curls? In short, what makes a champion
tick. Me, myself and I want to know.
Not to mention my rabid readers. So,
who's feeling up to sharing? Mmm? Shall
we start with the youngest. Lovely.


She takes Harry by the hand into a closet.

RITA
This is cosy.

HARRY
It's a broomcupboard.

RITA
You should feel right at home then.
Don't mind if I use the quill do you?


HARRY
Oh, no.

RITA
So Harry, here you sit, a mere boy of
twelve..

HARRY
I'm fourteen.

RITA
...about to compete against three students.
Not only vastly more emotionally mature
than yourself but have mastered spells
that you wouldn't attempt in your dizziest
daydreams. Concerned?

HARRY
I dunno I haven't really thought about
it.

RITA
Course you're not just any ordinary
boy of twelve are you...

HARRY
Fourteen.

RITA
The story's legend. Do you think it
was the trauma of your past that made
you so keen to enter such a dangerous
tournament.

HARRY
No I didn't enter.

RITA
Course you didn't. Everyone loves a
rebel Harry. (to the quill) Scratch
that last. Speaking of your parents,
were they alive, how do you think they'd
feel? proud? or concerned that your
attitude shows at best a pathological
need for attention, at worst a psychotic
deathwish.

HARRY
(looking at the notepad) Hey, my eyes
aren't glistening with the ghosts of
my past.


INT. ROOFTOP

An owl flies in with a letter for Harry, he takes it and begins
to read.

SIR
(VOICEOVER) Harry. I couldn't risk sending
Edward. It was since the world cup and
the ministry's been intercepting more
and more owls and she's too easily recognised.
We need to talk Harry. Face to face.
Meet me in the Griffindore common room
at one o clock this Saturday night and
make sure you're alone. P.S....

The owl nips Harry's finger.

HARRY
AGH!

SIR
(VOICEOVER CONT'D) The bird bites.



INT. GRIFFINDORE COMMON ROOM

HARRY
Sirius?

Harry picks up a newspaper, the headline reads "THE CHAMPIONS
ARE SELECTED" and reads.

RITA
(VOICEOVER) Harry Potter aged 12, suspect
entrant in the tri-wizard tournament.
His eyes swimming with the ghosts of
his...

Her voice becomes desperate as he crumples up the newspaper and
puts it on the fire. The fire flares up a little, a face appears
in it.

HARRY
Sirius?! How...

SIR
I don't have much time Harry so let
me get straight to it. Did you or did
you not put your name into the goblet
of fire?

HARRY
No!

SIR
Shh... I had to ask. Now, tell me about
this dream of yours. You mentioned Wormtail
and Voldemort, but who was the third
man in the room?

HARRY
I dunno.

SIR
You didn't hear a name?

HARRY
No. Umm.. Voldemort was giving him a
job to do. Something important.

SIR
What was that?

HARRY
He wanted... me. I dunno why, but he
was gonna use this man to get to me.
I mean it was only a dream right?


SIR
Yes. It's just a dream. Look Harry,
the deatheaters at the world cup, your
name rising from that goblet these are
not just coincidences. Hogwarts isn't
safe any more.

HARRY
What are you saying?

SIR
I'm saying the devils are inside the
walls. Igor Karkaroff, he was a deatheater.
And no one, no one stops being a deatheater.
Then there's Barty Crouch, heart of
stone, sent his OWN son to Azkaban.


HARRY
Do you think one of them put my name
in the goblet?

SIR
I haven't a clue who put your name in
that goblet Harry but whoever did it
is no friend to you. People die in this
tournament.

HARRY
I'm not ready for this Sirius.

SIR
You don't have a choice.

HARRY
Someone's coming!

SIR
Keep your friends close Harry.

Ron enters the room.

RON
Who you talking to?

HARRY
Who says I was talking to anyone.

RON
I heard voices.

HARRY
Maybe you're imagining things, wouldn't
be the first time.

RON
You're probably just practicing for
your next interview I expect.

Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone.
The newspaper in the fire has the headline "TEENAGE TRAGEDY".



EXT. LAKESIDE

NEVILLE
Amazing. Amazing.

HARRY
Neville! You're doing it again!

NEVILLE
Oh, right sorry.

HARRY
(reading a book) Magical water plants
of the highland Lochs?

NEVILLE
Moody gave it to me. That day we had
tea.

Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them.

HERMIONE
(Whispering to Ron) We've already been
through enough people why don't you
just go and do it yourself? Ughh. What
do you want me to say again?

Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry
are not on speaking terms.

Hermione walks up to Harry.

HERMIONE
Ronald would like me to tell you that
Seamus told him that Dean was told by
Parvati that Hagrid was looking for
you.

HARRY
Is that right? Well.... what?

HERMIONE
Uhhh...

She walks back to Ron for more whispering and comes back.

HERMIONE
Dean was told by Parvati that... Please
don't ask me say it again. Hagrid's
looking for you.

HARRY
Well you can tell Ronald...

HERMIONE
I'm NOT an owl!


INT. FOREST

Harry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest.

HAGRID
Did you bring your father's cloak like
I asked you?

HARRY
Yeah I brought the cloak. Hagrid where
are we going?

HAGRID
You'll see soon enough. Pay attention
this is important.

HARRY
What's with the flower? Hagrid have
you combed your hair?

Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big
red flower.

HAGRID
As a matter of fact I have. You might
like to try the same thing now and again.


We hear animal noises. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid.

MADAME MAXIME
Hagrid?

HAGRID
Oh, the cloak. Put the cloak on.

Harry does as he's told.

HAGRID
Bonsoir Olympe.

MADAME MAXIME
Oh Hagrid. I thought you weren't coming,
I thought perhaps... you had... forgotten
me.

HAGRID
Couldn't forget you Olympe.

MADAME MAXIME
What is it you want to show me? When
we spoke earlier you sounded so exhilirated.


HAGRID
You'll be glad you came. Trust me.


A dragon nearby gives a loud roar.

MADAME MAXIME
Ahh, c'est magnifique!

In an opening we see people are running about, dragons are roaring
and breathing fire.

MADAME MAXIME
Can we get closer?

HARRY
Dragons? That's the first task? You're
joking.

HAGRID
Come on Harry. They're seriously misunderstood
creatures.

A huge flame fires up.

HAGRID
Although, I have to admit that horntail
is a right nasty piece of work. Poor
Ron nearly fainted just seeing him you
know.

HARRY
Ron was here?

HAGRID
Oh sure. His brother Charlie helped
bring him over from Romania. Didn't
Ron tell you that?

HARRY
No he didn't. He didn't tell me a thing.



EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME

We're zoomed in on a badge, it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow
background. Then the badge spins and shows Harry on a green background
with the words "Potter Stinks" on it. As Harry walks along other
pupils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs
past.

BOY
Cedric rules!

HARRY
Thanks.

Harry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way.

BOY
Like the badge?

HARRY
Excuse me..

They laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric
who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl
off more insults.

HARRY
(to Cedric) Can I have a word?

CEDRIC
Alright.

They walk away some distance.

HARRY
Dragons. That's the first task. They've
got one for each of us.

CEDRIC
Are you serious? And Fleur and Krum,
do they...?

HARRY
Yes.

CEDRIC
Right. Hey listen, about the badges.
I've asked them not to wear them.


HARRY
Don't worry about it.

Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them.

HARRY
(To Ron) You're a right foul git you
know that?

RON
You think so?

HARRY
I know so.

RON
Anything else?

HARRY
Yeah. Stay away from me.

RON
Fine.


Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree.

DRACO
Why so tense Potter? My father and I
have a bet you see. I don't think you're
gonna last ten minutes in this tournament.
He disagrees. He thinks you won't last
FIVE.

HARRY
I don't give a damn what you or your
father thinks Malfoy. He's vile and
cruel, and you're just pathetic.

Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye
appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret.

MAD-EYE
I'll teach you to cast when someone's
back is turned.

MCGONAGALL
Professor Moody what are you doing?


MAD-EYE
Teaching.

MCGONAGALL
Is that a student?

MAD-EYE
Technically it's a ferret.

Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the
trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable.
Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs.
Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back
to normal.

DRACO
My father will hear about this!

MAD-EYE
Is that a threat!

Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him.

MAD-EYE
I could tell you stories about your
father that would curl even your greasy
hair boy! It doesn't end here!

MCGONAGALL
We never use transfigration as a punishment,
surely Dumbledore told you that.

MAD-EYE
He might've mentioned it.

MCGONAGALL
Well you will do well to remember it.


MAD-EYE
(To Harry) come with me.


INT. MAD-EYE'S ROOM

Mad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat.

MAD-EYE
That's a foal glass. Lets me keep an
eye on my enemies. If I can see the
whites of their eyes they're standing
right behind me.

A noise emerges from a trunk on the floor and it shakes.

MAD-EYE
Wouldn't even bother telling you what's
in ther. You wouldn't believe it if
I did. Now... what are you going to
do about your dragon?

HARRY
Oh... um... You know I just thought
I'd...

MAD-EYE
Sit. Listen to me Potter. Your pal Diggory,
by your age he could take a whistle
into a watch and have it sing you the
time. Miss Delacour, she's as much a
fairy princess as I am. As for Krum,
his head may be filled with sawdust
but Karkaroff's is NOT. They'll have
a strategy, and you can bet that it'll
play to Krum's strengths. Hmm? Come
on Potter. What are your strengths?


HARRY
Um... I dunno.. I can fly. I mean I'm
a fair flyer.

MAD-EYE
Better than fair the way I heard it.


HARRY
But I'm not allowed a broom.

MAD-EYE
You're allowed a wand.


EXT. ARENA - TOURNAMENT STAGE 1

The crowds are cheering, people are taking bets.


INT. WAITING TENT

Harry is pacing nervously. Hermione is standing by the tent door
whispering in.

HERMIONE
Pssst! Harry? Is that you?

HARRY
Yeah.

HERMIONE
How are you feeling? OK? The key is
to concentrate. After that you just
have to...

HARRY
Battle a dragon.

Hermione enters the tent and they hug. A bright camera flashes,
Rita Skeeter the journalist approaches.

RITA
Young love! Ohh how.. stirring. If everything
goes unfortunately today you might make
the front page.

VIKTOR
(To Rita) You have no business here.
This tent is for champions and friends.


RITA
No matter. We've got what we wanted.


Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters.

DUMBLEDORE
Good day champions. Gather round please.
Now you've waited, you've wondered and
at last the moment has arrived. The
moment only four of you can fully appreciate.


The champions gather around him in a circle.

DUMBLEDORE
What are you doing here Miss Granger?


HERMIONE
Oh um.. Sorry I'll just go.

DUMBLEDORE
Barty. The bag.

BARTY
Champions, in a circle around me. Miss
Delacour over here, Mr Krum, and Potter
over here. Right. Miss Delacour, if
you will...

Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon.


BARTY
The welsh green. Mr Krum...

Viktor takes another out

BARTY
The chinese fireball. Oooooh.

Cedric picks one.

BARTY
The swedish short-snout. Which leaves...


HARRY
The horntail...

BARTY
What's that boy?

HARRY
Nothing.

Harry puts his hand in the bag and pulls out the dragon.

BARTY
The hungarian horntail. These represent
very real dragons, each of which has
been given a golden egg to protect.
Your objective is simple, collect the
egg. This you must do, for each egg
contains a clue without which you cannot
hope to proceed to the next task. Any
questions?

DUMBLEDORE
Very well. Good luck champions. Mr Diggory
the sound of the cannon...

The cannon fires immediately.

INT. TENT

Harry is sitting alone nervously.

DUMBLEDORE
(VOICEOVER THE LOUDSPEAKER) Three of
our champions have now faced their dragons
and so each one of them will proceed
to the next task. And now our fourth
and final contestant.

Harry enters the rocky arena. The crowd are cheering his name.
He sees the golden egg sitting alone, he makes a run for it but
the dragon appears. Harry's forced to retreat behind a rock as
the dragon flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena.


HERMIONE
Your wand harry! Your wand!

Harry summons a broom. He jumps on and flies off, the dragon
gives chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look
stunned.


EXT. HOGWARTS SKY

Harry is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings.
The dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom, he lands
on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon
is clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry
reaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets
go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him.
He falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area
with a bridge, he flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon
crashes into it and falls into the water.


INT. ARENA

The crowds are mostly silent. We see Harry flying towards us
and the crowd erupts. He goes straight for the golden egg.



INT. HOGWARTS

Harry is lifting the golden egg, people around him cheering.
The Weasly twins have Harry sitting on their shoulders.

GEORGE
We knew you wouldn't die Harry.

FRED
Lose a leg.

GEORGE
Or an arm.

FRED
Pack it in altogether.

TWINS
NEVER!

SEAMUS
Go on Harry, what's the clue?

Seamus hands Harry the golden egg.

HARRY
Who wants me to open it? You want me
to open it?

He opens the egg and a loud horrific screech comes out, he closes
it again.

HARRY
What the bloody hell was that?

Ron appears in the doorway.

FRED
Alright everyone, go back to your knitting.
This is gonna be uncomfortable enough
without all you nosey sods listening
in.

RON
I reckon you'd have to be barking mad
to put your own name in the goblet of
fire.

HARRY
Caught on have you. Took you long enough.


RON
Wasn't just me who thought you'd done
it. Everyone was saying it behind your
back.

HARRY
Brilliant. That makes me feel loads
better.

RON
At least I warned you about the dragons.


HARRY
Hagrid warned me about the dragons.


RON
Oh no no, I did. Don't you remember?
I told Hermione to tell you that Seamus
told me that Parvati told Dean that
Hagrid was looking for you. Seamus never
actually told me anything, so it was
really me all along. I thought you'd
be alright, you know, after you figured
that out.

HARRY
Who could possibly figure that out?
That's completely mental.

RON
Yeah it is isn't it. Suppose I was a
bit distraught.

HERMIONE
Boys.


INT. CLASSROOM

Harry is looking at Cho. When she looks back he spills drink
from his mouth. They laugh at him.

HERMIONE
(Reading a newspaper) Look at this!
I can't believe it she's done it again.
Miss Granger a plain but ambitious girl
seems to be developing a taste for famous
wizards. Her latest prey sources report
is none other than the Bulgarian bon-bon
Viktor Krum. No word yet on how Harry
Potter's taking this latest emotional
blow.

A young boy walks up holding a package.

NIGEL
Parcel for you Mr Weasley.

RON
Thank you Nigel.

Nigel is gazing at Harry.

RON
Not now Nigel. Later. Go on.

Nigel leaves.

RON
I told him I'd get him Harry's autograph.
Oh look mum's sent me something. Mum
sent me a dress??

HARRY
Well it does match your eyes. Is there
a bonnet?

RON
Ginny these must be for you.

GINNY
I'm not wearing that it's ghastly.


Hermione laughs.

RON
What are you on about?

HERMIONE
They're not for Ginny they're for you!
Dress robes.

RON
Dress robes? for what?


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

MCGONAGALL
The yule ball has been a tradition of
the tri-wizard tournament since its
inception. On Christmas eve night we
and our guests gather in the great hall
for well mannered frivolity. As representitives
of the host school I expect each and
every one of you to put your best foot
forward, and I mean this literally because
the yule ball is first and foremost...
a dance.

Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem
a lot more excited.

MCGONAGALL
Silence. The house of Godrick Griffindore
has commanded the respect of the wizard
world for nearly ten centuries. I will
not have you in the course of a single
evening besmirching that name by behaving
like a babbling, bumbling band of baboons.


FRED
(Whispering to George) Try saying that
five times faster.

They try.

MCGONAGALL
(Continued) Now to dance is to let the
body breathe, inside every girl a secret
swan slumbers longing to burst forth
and take flight.

RON
(Whispering to Seamus) Something's about
to burst out of Hilary but I don't think
it's a swan.

MCGONAGALL
Inside every boy a lordly lion prepared
to prance. Mr Weasly, will you join
me.

She grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance.

MCGONAGALL
Now, place your right hand on my waist.


RON
Where?

MCGONAGALL
My waist.

He does so and a wolf whistle comes from the crowd.

MCGONAGALL
Now bend your arm. Mr Filch...

The music starts.

MCGONAGALL
One two three, one two three, one two
three.

HARRY
(To the Weasly twins) Oi! Never gonna
let him forget this are you?

TWINS
Never.

MCGONAGALL
Everybody come together.

The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all
still seated.

MCGONAGALL
Boys, on your feet.

Neville stands.


EXT. HOGWARTS - DAYTIME

HARRY
Why do they always have to travel in
packs? How are you supposed to get one
alone to ask them...

RON
Blimey Harry, you slayed dragons. If
you can't get a date who can?

HARRY
I think I'd take the dragon right now.


Groups of girls are giving them icy looks and turning their backs.



INT. HOGWARTS

Hagrid and Madame Maxime are walking together.

HAGRID
I take after my mum. Though I didn't
know her very well, she left when I
was about three. No, not the maternal
sort her, broke my dad's heart though.
You know he was a tiny little fellow
my dad, I could pick him up with one
hand by the age of six and put him up
in the dresser.

They laugh together and have a moment.

HAGRID
And then he died when I was still in
school. So I had to make me own way
as it were. But enough of me, what about
you!


EXT. LAKESIDE

Viktor Krum is training, a group of girls are following him around.



INT. CLASSROOM

RON
This is mad. At this rate we'll be the
only ones in our year without dates.


Severus Snape walks past and slaps Ron over the head.

RON
Well, us and Neville!

HARRY
But then again he can take himself.


HERMIONE
It might interest you to know that Neville's
already got someone.

Ron gasps.

RON
Now I'm really depressed.

Fred hands Ron a note, it reads "GET A MOVE ON OR ALL THE GOOD
ONES WILL HAVE GONE!".

RON
Well Hermione, you're a girl.

HERMIONE
Oh well spotted.

RON
Come on. It's one thing for a bloke
to show up alone. For a girl it's just
sad.

HERMIONE
I won't be going alone because believe
it or not someone's asked me. And I
said yes.

RON
Bloody hell.

Hermione storms off.

RON
Look. We've just got to grit our teeth
and do it. Tonight when we get back
to the common room, we'll both have
partners. Agreed?

HARRY
Agreed.


EXT. HOGWARTS - SNOWY

Harry is walking up some steps. He reaches the top and bumps
into Cho who has come around the corner.

CHO
Harry!

HARRY
Cho!

CHO
Watch yourself on the stairs, it's a
bit icey at the top.

HARRY
Ok thanks. Cho?

CHO
Yes?

HARRY
Um. (Mumbling) I just wondered if maybe
you wanted to go to the ball with me?


CHO
Sorry? I didn't catch that.

HARRY
Um. I was just wondering if maybe you
wanted to go to the ball with me.


CHO
Oh. Um. Harry I'm sorry but someone's
already asked me. And well I've said
I'll go with him.

HARRY
Ok. Great. Fine. No problem. Good.


CHO
Harry I really am sorry.


INT. COMMON ROOM

Ron is being helped into the room, he looks shaky.

HARRY
What happened to you?

GIRL
He just asked Fleur Delacour out.

HERMIONE
What?

HARRY
What did she say?

HERMIONE
No of course.

Ron shakes his head.

HERMIONE
She said yes??

HARRY
Don't be silly.

RON
There she was walking by. You know I
like it when they walk. I couldn't help
it, it just sort of slipped out.

GIRL
Actually he sort of screamed at her,
it was a bit frightening.

HARRY
What did you do then?

RON
What else? I ran for it. I'm not cut
out for this Harry. I don't know what
got into me.

The Patil twins walk past.

PATILS
Hi Harry.

HARRY
Hey!


INT. DANCEHALL

Soft music plays and everyone is well dressed, gathered in the
hall.


ELSEWHERE

Ron is getting dressed in front of a mirror. He looks paniced
and uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes.

RON
Bloody hell.

Harry walks in, he's dressed in a more conventional suit.

RON
What are those??

HARRY
My dress robes.

RON
Well they're alright. No lace, no dodgy
little collar.

HARRY
Well I expect yours are more traditional.


RON
Traditional?? They're ancient! I look
like my great aunt Tessie.

He sniffs at his clothes.

RON
I smell like my great aunt Tessie. Murder
me Harry.


INT. DANCEHALL

Harry and Ron are walking down the stairs into the hall. Ron
is fidgeting with his outfit.

HARRY
Leave it alone.

RON
Poor kid, bet she's alone in her room
crying her eyes out.

HARRY
Who?

RON
Hermione of course. Come on Harry, why'd
you think she wouldn't tell us who she's
coming with?

HARRY
Because we'd take the mickey out of
her if she did.

RON
Because nobody asked her. I would have
taken her myself if she weren't so bleeding
proud.

The boys approach the Patil twins.

PARVATI
Hello boys. Don't you look...

She looks at Ron.

PARVATI
... dashing.

MCGONAGALL
Here you are Potter. Are you and Miss
Patil ready?

HARRY
Ready professor?

MCGONAGALL
To dance. It's traditional that the
three champions or in this case four
are the first to dance. Surely I told
you that.

HARRY
No.

MCGONAGALL
Oh well now you know. Oh, as for your
Mr Weasly you may proceed into the great
hall with Miss Patil.

Hermione enters the room all dressed up.

PARVATI
She looks beautiful.

HARRY
Yeah she does.

Hermione walks down the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand and
they walk together.

PADMA
(To Ron) Is that Hermione Granger? With
Viktor Krum??

RON
No. Absolutely not.

Loud music plays as the champions head to the dancefloor with
their partners.

PARVATI
Harry. Take my waist.

HARRY
What?

PARVATI
Now.

They dance. Soon others are joining in, Dumbledore and McGonagall,
Mr Filch and his cat, Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye sits
on the sidelines drinking. The scene changes, the music is now
rock played by the Weird Sisters fronted by Jarvis Cocker from
Pulp. Cool!. The crowd is jumping. Harry, Ron and their dates
are sitting some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes
up after a great time with Viktor.

HERMIONE
Hot isn't it? Viktor's gone to get drinks.
Care to join us?

RON
No, we'd NOT care to join you and Viktor.


HERMIONE
What's got your wand in a knot?

RON
He's a Durmstrang. You're fraternising
with the enemy.

HERMIONE
The enemy?? Who was it wanting his autograph?
Besides, the whole point of the tournament
is international magical cooperation,
to make friends.

RON
Hrmph, I think he's got a bit more than
friendship on his mind.

Hermione walks off.

PADMA
Are you going to ask me to dance or
not?

RON
No.


LATER

RON
(To Hermione) He's using you.

HERMIONE
How dare you! Besides I can take care
of myself.

RON
Doubt it. He's way too old.

HERMIONE
What? What? That's what you think?


RON
Yeah that is what I think.

HERMIONE
You know the solution then don't you.


RON
Go on.

HERMIONE
Next time there's a ball pluck up the
courage and ask me before somebody else
does, and not as a last resort.

RON
Well that's completely off the point.
Harry...

Harry walks up.

HERMIONE
Where have you been? Nevermind! Off
to bed both of you.

Harry and Ron walk away.

RON
They get scary when they get older.


HERMIONE
Ron you spoil everything!


INT. BEDROOM

NIGHTMARE SEQUENCE

We're back in the old house.

VOLDERMORT
Let me see it again.

A sleeve is rolled up and a marking of a skull and snake in on
the arm.

VOLDEMORT
Ah yes, the time is close now. Harry!
At last! Step aside Wormtail so I can
give our guest a proper greeting!


Harry wakes up. The floorboards are creaking, someone is walking
up to his bed. It's Neville.

NEVILLE
You alright Harry? I just got in. Me!


He chuckles and dances off.


EXT. A BRIDGE OUTSIDE HOGWARTS

HERMIONE
Harry you told me you'd figured the
egg out weeks ago. The task is two days
from now.

HARRY
Really? I had no idea. I suppose Viktor's
already figured it out.

HERMIONE
I wouldn't know, we didn't actually
talk about the tournament. Actually
we didn't really talk at all, Viktor's
more of a physical being. I just mean
he's not particularly... Mostly he watches
me study. It's a bit annoying actually.
You are trying to figure this egg out
aren't you?

HARRY
What's that supposed to mean?

HERMIONE
I mean these tasks are supposed to test
you, in the most brutal way they're
almost cruel. And um, I'm scared for
you. You got by the dragon mostly on
nerve, I'm not sure it's going to be
enough this time.

CEDRIC
Hey Potter.

HARRY
Cedric.

CEDRIC
How are you?

HARRY
Spectacular.

CEDRIC
Look I realise I never really thanked
you properly for tipping me off about
those dragons.

HARRY
Forget about it. I'm sure you would
have done the same for me.

CEDRIC
Exactly. You know the prefects bathroom
on the fifth floor?

Harry nods.

CEDRIC
It's not a bad place for a bath. Just
take your egg and mull things over in
the hot water.


INT. BATHROOM

Harry is taking his clothes off, he gets in the bath. He has
his golden egg on the side.

HARRY
I must be out of my mind.

He opens the egg and the horrible screech noise comes out.

MYRTLE
I'd try putting it in the water if I
were you.

HARRY
Myrtle!

MYRTLE
Long time no see.

The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around.

MYRTLE
I was circling a blocked drain the other
day and could swear I saw a bit of polyjuice
potion. Not being a bad boy again are
you Harry?

HARRY
Polyjuice potion! Kicked the habit.
Myrtle, did you say try putting it in
the water?

Myrtle flies around again and gets in the water.

MYRTLE
Well. That's what he did. The other
boy, the handsome one. Cedric.

Harry takes the egg and puts it under the water.

MYRTLE
Well go on, open it.

Harry does so and goes underwater himself. He hears a voice singing.


VOICE SINGING
Come seek us where our voices sound.
We cannot sing above the ground. An
hour long you'll have to look, to recover
what we took.

HARRY
Myrtle, there aren't Merpeople in the
black lake are there?

MYRTLE
Ahhh, very good. Took Cedric ages to
riddle it out. Almost all the bubbles
were gone...

Myrtle laughs and Harry is embarrassed.


INT. COMMON ROOM

HERMIONE
Harry, tell me again.

HARRY
Come seek us where our voices sound.


HERMIONE
The black lake, that's obvious.

HARRY
An hour long you'll have to look.

HERMIONE
Again obvious, though I must admit potentially
problematic

HARRY
Potentially problematic? When was the
last time you held your breath under
the water for an hour Hermione?

HERMIONE
Look Harry, we can do this. The three
of us can figure it out.

Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway.

MAD-EYE
Hate to break up this scholar session
but Professor McGonagall would like
to see you in her office. Not you Potter,
just Weasly and Granger.

HERMIONE
But sir, the second task is only hours
away and...

MAD-EYE
Exactly. Presumably Potter is well prepared
by now and could do with a good night's
sleep. Go. Now! Longbottom!

Neville appears from behind a bookcase.

MAD-EYE
Why don't you help Potter put his books
back.

NEVILLE
You know, if you're interested in plants
you'd be better with Gorshok's Guide
to Herbology. Do you know there's a
wizard in Nepal whose growing gravity
resistant trees?

HARRY
Neville. No offense, but I really don't
care about plants. Now if there's a
Tibetan turnip that will allow me to
breathe underwater for an hour then
great.

NEVILLE
I don't know about a turnip but you
can always use gilliweed.


EXT. LAKESIDE

The Weasly twins are shouting, busy taking bets. Harry is walking
along with Neville, he has some green plantlife in his hand.


HARRY
You're sure about this Neville.

NEVILLE
Absolutely.

HARRY
For an hour.

NEVILLE
Most likely.

HARRY
Most likely?

NEVILLE
Well there is some debate among herbologists
as to the effects of freshwater versus
saltwater.

HARRY
You're telling me this now? You must
be joking.

NEVILLE
I just wanted to help.

HARRY
Well that makes you sight better than
Ron and Hermione. Where are they anyway?


NEVILLE
You seem a little tense Harry.

HARRY
Do I?

DUMBLEDORE
(Over a loudspeaker) Welcome to the
second task. Last night something was
stolen from each of our champions. A
treasure of sorts. These four treasures,
one for each champion, now lie on the
bottom of the black lake. In order to
win each champion need only find their
treasure and return to the surface.
Simple enough. Except for this, they
will have one hour to do so and one
hour only. After that they'll be on
their own.

MAD-EYE
(To Harry) Put that in your mouth.


Harry puts the gilliweed in his mouth and starts choking.

DUMBLEDORE
(Continued) You may begin at the start
of the cannon.

The cannon fires and the champions enter the water, three of
them dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater the effects of
gilliweed take hold, Harry's hands and feet become webbed.



EXT. ABOVE WATER

SEAMUS
What's the matter with him?

FRIEND
I don't know I can't see him.

NEVILLE
Oh my god I've killed Harry Potter!


Harry flies into the air like a dolphin and the crowd cheer.



EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry swims among the fish and rocks. Singing voices start echoing.
We see Fleur get trapped, she screams.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

DUMBLEDORE
(Over the loudspeaker) The Beauxbatons
champion Miss Delacour has unfortunately
been forced to retire. She will take
no further part in this task.


EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry is still searching around. He hears muffled screams. He
finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chan and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons
tied in place by their ankles. Cedric is there, he takes Cho
with him. Harry sets about freeing Ron and Hermione but vicious
merpeople appear.

HARRY
But she's my friend too!

MERPERSON
Only one.

What looks like a shark approaches at high speed. We see that
it has legs and it's Viktor. He takes Hermione and heads for
the surface. Harry frees Ron.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

Cedric and Cho emerge, the crowd cheers. Viktor and Hermione
next, the crows chants 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. The Beauxbatons girls
look worried.


EXT. UNDERWATER

Harry looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable
to rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the
surface with the both of them. He's attacked and gets held down,
he pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface.


EXT. ABOVE WATER

Ron and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They're
helped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater
Harry casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he
flies out and lands on the decking where the crowd are.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry!

BARTY
Get him another towel.

DUMBLEDORE
I want all the judges over here now.


FLEUR
(To Harry) You saved her, even though
she wasn't yours to save. My little
sister!

Fleur kisses Harry on the face.

FLEUR
Thank you! And you... (Looks to Ron).
You helped!

RON
Well... yeah... a bit

Fleur kisses him too.

RON
Merci.

Hermione comes up to Harry with a towel.

HERMIONE
Harry!

HARRY
Hermione

HERMIONE
Are you alright? You must be freezing!
Personally I think you behaved admirably.


Hermione kisses Harry on the head.

HARRY
I finished last Hermione.

HERMIONE
Next to last.

DUMBLEDORE
Attention! Attention! The winner is...
Mr Diggory!

Cedric and his friends cheer.

DUMBLEDORE
For showing unique command of the bubblehead
shark. The way I see it, Mr Potter would
have finished first had it not been
for his determination to rescue not
only Mr Weasly but the others as well.
We've agreed to award him second place!
For outstanding moral fibre.


As they're walking away from the lake Harry's friends are cheering
him.

FRED
All that moral fibre eh?

RON
Blimey even when you go wrong it turns
out right.

GEORGE
Well done 'moral fibre'.


Barty Crouch is waiting for Harry.

BARTY
Congratulations Potter, fine achievement.
Well done boy. I'm sorry we haven't
spoken, after all your story is one
I've heard many times. Quite remarkable.
Tragic of course, to lose one's family.
Never whole again are we? Still, life
goes on. And here we stand. I'm sure
your parents would be very proud today
Potter.

Mad-Eye approaches them.

MAD-EYE
Bartimus! Not trying to lure Potter
into one of the ministry's summer internships
are we? Last boy who went into the department
of ministries never came out!

Barty walks away from him.

MAD-EYE
And they say I'm mad.


EXT. DARK FOREST

HAGRID
So I remember, I remember when I first
met you all. Biggest bunch of misfits
I've ever set eyes on. Always reminded
me of myself a little. And here we all
are, four years later.

RON
We're still misfits.

HAGRID
Maybe. But we've all got each other,
and Harry of course. Soon to be! The
youngest! Tri-Wizard champion there's
ever been! Hooray!

They walk on singing the Hogwarts song. Harry holds his head
in pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless.


HARRY
Mr Crouch?


INT. HOGWARTS DARK ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
A man has died here. And he won't be
the last, you must take action.

FUDGE
I will not. In times like these the
wizard world looks to its leaders for
strength Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE
Then for once show them some.

FUDGE
The tri-wizard tournament will not be
cancelled. I will not be seen as a coward.


DUMBLEDORE
But surely that is what's right, no
matter what others think.

FUDGE
What did you say? What did you say to
me?

MAD-EYE
Excuse me gentlemen, it may interest
you to know that this conversation is
no longer private.

Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters.

FUDGE
Harry! Harry how good to see you again.


HARRY
I can come back later Professor.

DUMBLEDORE
Oh not necessary Harry the minister
and I are done. I'll be back in a moment.
Minister, after you. Harry do feel free
to indulge in a liquorice snack in my
absence, but I have to warn you they're
a little bit sharp.

Harry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl
and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips
at his hand.

HARRY
Agh!

A compartment in the wall opens, there's a glowing blue pool
of water there. He looks in. He falls and lands in another time
and place. It's a courtroom, the walls have a red glow. Dumbledore
is seated next to where Harry is.


INT. COURTROOM

HARRY
Professor?

The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks.

MAN
Professor.

Dumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through
Harry's body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence.
Proceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor.


BARTY
Igor Karkaroff, you have been brought
from Azkaban at your own request to
present evidence to this counsel. Should
your testimony prove consequential.
Counsel may be prepared to order your
immediate release. Until such time you
remain in the eyes of the ministry a
convicted deatheater. Do you accept
these terms?

IGOR
I do sir.

BARTY
What do you wish to present?

IGOR
I have names sir. There was a Rosier,
Evan Rosier.

BARTY
Mr Rosier is dead.

IGOR
Dead?

MAD-EYE
(To Dumbledore) Yeah took a piece of
me with him though didn't he.

Mad-Eye points to his mechanical eye.

IGOR
I didn't know.

BARTY
If that is all the witness has to offer...


IGOR
No! No! There was Rookwood, he was a
spy.

BARTY
Augustus Rookwood? Of the department
of ministries.

IGOR
Ya ya, the same. He passed information
to you know who from inside the ministry
itself.

BARTY
Very well. Counsel will deliberate.
In the meantime you will be returned
to Azkaban.

IGOR
NO! WAIT! PLEASE! I have more. Snape,
Severus Snape.

DUMBLEDORE
The counsel is very much aware you have
given evidence on this matter. Severus
Snape was indeed a deatheater and prior
to Lord Voldemort's downfall turned
spy for us at great personal risk. Today
he's no more a deatheater than I am.


Igor protests loudly.

IGOR
It's a lie! Severus Snape remains faithful
to the dark lord.

BARTY
Silence!

Barty hits the gavel repeatedly.

BARTY
Unless the witness possesses any name
of genuine consequence this session
is now concluded.

IGOR
Oh no no no no no. I heard about one
more.

BARTY
What's that?

IGOR
The name...

BARTY
Yes?

IGOR
I know for a fact this person took part
in the capture, and by means of the
cruciatus curse, torture of the aurer
Frank Longbottom and...

BARTY
The name! Give me the wretched name!


IGOR
Barty Crouch! ... Junior.

Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic,
he falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar.
Guards seize Barty junior.

BARTY JR
Get your hands off me you pathetic little
men. Hello father.

BARTY
You are no son of mine.

BARTY JR
GAHHHH!

Harry steps out of the blue pool and we're back in the darkened
room.

DUMBLEDORE
Curiosity's not a sin Harry, but you
should exercise caution. It's a pensieve,
useful if like me you find your mind
a wee bit stretched. It allows me to
see what small things I've already seen.
You see Harry I've searched and searched
for something, some small detail. Something
I might have overlooked, something that
would explain why these terrible things
have happened. Every time I get close
to an answer it slips away, it's maddedning.


HARRY
Sir, Mr Crouch's son, what happened
to him?

DUMBLEDORE
He was sent to Azkaban. Destroyed Barty
to do it. But he had no choice, the
evidence was overwhelming. Why do you
ask?

HARRY
It's just that I had a dream about him.
It was in the summer, before school.
In the dream I was in a house and Voldemort
was there only he wasn't quite human,
and Wormtail was there too and Mr Crouch's
son.

DUMBLEDORE
Have there been other dreams like this?


HARRY
Yes. Always the same one. Sir... these
dreams, what I see, you don't think
it's actually happening do you?

DUMBLEDORE
I think it's unwise for you to linger
over these dreams Harry, I think it's
best that you simply...

Dumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic
out from his head.

DUMBLEDORE
Cast them away.


INT. CORRIDOR

Harry is walking along, we hear raised voices from inside the
herbs store.

IGOR
It's a sign Severus, you know what it
means as well as I.

The door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves.


SEVERUS
Potter! What's your hurry? Congratulations,
your performance in the black lake was
inspiring. Gilliweed, am I correct?


HARRY
Yes sir.

SEVERUS
Ingenious. A rather rare herb gilliweed,
not something found in your every day
garden. Nor is this, know what it is?


HARRY
Bubble juice sir?

SEVERUS
Veritaserum. Three drops of this and
you-know-who himself will spill his
darkest secrets. The use of this on
a student is regrettably forbidden,
however should you ever steal from my
personal stores again, my hand might
just slip over your morning pumpkin
juice.

HARRY
I haven't stolen anything.

SEVERUS
Don't lie to me. Gilliweed might be
innocuous, but boomslang skin? lacewing
flies? You and your friends are brewing
polyjuice potion and believe me I'm
going to find out why.

Severus closes the door in Harry's face.


EXT. ARENA

Music is playing and a large crowd is gathered. The champions
emerge.

DUMBLEDORE
Earlier today Professor Moody placed
the tri-wizards cup deep within the
maze. Only he knows its exact position.
Now as Mr Diggory...

The crowd cheer on hearing his name.

DUMBLEDORE
(continued) and Mr Potter tied for first
position they will be the first to enter
the maze. Followed by Mr Krum...

The bulgarian crowd go nuts.

DUMBLEDORE
(continued) The first person to touch
the cup will be the winner. I've instructed
the staff to patrol the perimeter, if
at any point should a contestant wish
to withdraw from the task he or she
need only send up red sparks with their
wands. Contestants, gather round.


DUMBLEDORE
(To the contestants) In the maze you'll
find not dragons or creatures of the
deep. Instead you'll face something
more challenging. You see, people change
in the maze. Oh find the cup if you
can, but be very weary you could just
lose yourselves along the way.

MAD-EYE
Champions! Prepare yourselves.

Cedric hugs his father.

DUMBLEDORE
On the count of three... ONE...

The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans.
Harry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances.
The entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan
out to see the maze is many stories tall. Harry starts traversing
the maze, creature noises are all around.

Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on
him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she
is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's
unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being
swallowed into the undergrowth.

HARRY
Fleur? Fleur!

He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into
the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry
runs. Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves
towards it Viktor tries to zap him but misses.

CEDRIC
Get down!

Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up
and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at
Viktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes.


HARRY
No stop! He's bewitched Cedric.

They struggle.

CEDRIC
Get off me!

HARRY
He's bewitched!

The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth
grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric
is pinned down with no means of escape.

CEDRIC
Harry! Harry!

Harry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps
him up.

CEDRIC
You know for a moment there I thought
you were gonna let it get me.

HARRY
For a moment so did I.

CEDRIC
Some game huh?

HARRY
Some game.

The wind starts blowing again.

CEDRIC
Go. Take it, you saved me!

HARRY
Together, on three. One, two, three!



EXT. GRAVEYARD

Harry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard.

CEDRIC
You ok?

HARRY
Yeah, you?

CEDRIC
Where are we?

HARRY
I've been here before.

CEDRIC
It's a portkey. Harry the cup is a portkey.


HARRY
I've been here before in a dream. Cedric,
we have to get back to the cup? Now!


CEDRIC
What are you talking about?

Harry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain.

CEDRIC
What is it?

HARRY
Get back to the cup!

We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby.

CEDRIC
Who are you? What do you want?

VOLDEMORT
Kill the spare.

Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric.

HARRY
Cedric!

Cedric lays dead on the ground.

Wormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and
traps him.

VOLDEMORT
Do it, now!

Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on.


WORMTAIL
Bones of the father, unwillingly given.


A bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it
into the cauldron.

WORMTAIL
Flesh of the servent willingly sacrificed.


He takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron.

WORMTAIL
Blood of the enemy forcibly taken.


He takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts.
Wormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops
fall into it.

WORMTAIL
The dark lord shall rise again.

The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges.


VOLDEMORT
My wand Wormtail.

Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply.

VOLDEMORT
Hold out your arm.

WORMTAIL
Master. Thank you master.

VOLDEMORT
The other arm Wormtail.

Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks
the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been
summoned.

VOLDEMORT
Welcome my friends. Thirty years it's
been, and yet you stand before me as
though it were only yesterday. I confess
myself disappointed, not one of you
tried to find me.

Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures.

VOLDEMORT
Not even you, Lucius.

LUCIUS
My lord. Had I detected any sign or
even a whisper of your whereabouts.


VOLDEMORT
There were signs my friend, and more
than whispers.

LUCIUS
I assure you I never renounced the old
ways. The face I have been obliged to
present each day since your absence,
that was my true mask.

WORMTAIL
I returned.

VOLDEMORT
Out of fear, not loyalty. Still you
have proved yourself useful these past
few months Wormtail.

Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand.

WORMTAIL
Thank you master, thank you.

VOLDEMORT
(To Cedric's corpse) Oh, such a handsome
boy.

HARRY
Don't touch him.

Harry struggles to get free.

VOLDEMORT
Harry! I'd almost forgotten you were
here. Standing on the bones of my father.
I'd introduce you but word has it you're
almost as famous as me these days. The
boy who lived. How lies have fed your
legend Harry. Shall I reveal what really
happened that night thirteen years ago?
Shall I divulge how I truly lost my
powers? It was love. You see when dear
sweet Lily Potter gave her life for
her only son she provided the ultimate
protection. I could not touch you. It
was old magic, something I should have
forseen. But no matter, no matter. Things
have changed, I can touch you now!


Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams.

VOLDEMORT
Astonishing what a few drops of your
blood will do eh Harry? Pick up your
wand Potter. I said pick it up, get
up. Get up! You've been taught how to
duel I presume yes? First we bow to
each other. Come on now Harry the niceties
must be observed, Dumbledore would not
want you to forget your manners now
would he? I said bow!

Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic.

VOLDEMORT
That's better. And now...

Voldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain.

VOLDEMORT
Atta boy Harry, your parents would be
proud. Especially your filthy mongrel
mother. I'm going to kill you Harry
Potter, I'm going to destroy you. After
tonight no one will ever again question
my powers. After tonight if they speak
of you they'll speak only of how you
begged for death, and I being a merciful
lord obliged. Get up.

Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away.


VOLDEMORT
Don't you turn your back on me Harry
Potter I want you to look at me when
I kill you, I want to see the lights
leave your eyes.

Harry takes steps toward Voldemort.

HARRY
Have it your way.

They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle.


VOLDEMORT
Do nothing. He is mine to finish. He's
mine!

Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. We hear Dumbledore's
voice.

HARRY'S DAD
(voice) Harry when the connection is
broken you must get to the portkey.
We can delay it for a moment to give
you time but only a moment, do you understand?


CEDRIC
(voice) Harry take my body back will
you? Take my body back to my father.


HARRY'S MOTHER
(voice) Let go. Sweetheart you're ready.
Let go! Let go!

The connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric's body and summons
the cup over to them. In an instant the port out. Voldemort looks
angry.

VOLDEMORT
No!


EXT. ARENA

Back at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. The crowd
don't understand what has taken place and they all cheer, triumphant
music starts to play. Harry weeps on Cedric's body.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry! Harry!

Dumbledore tries to prize Harry from Cedric's body.

DUMBLEDORE
Tell me what happened!

HARRY
He's back, he's back! Voldemort's back.
Cedric, he asked me to bring his body
back. I couldn't leave him, not there.


DUMBLEDORE
It's alright Harry. It's alright, he's
home, you both are.

FUDGE
Keep everybody in their seats. A boy
has just been killed. The body must
be moved Dumbledore, there are... too
many people.

AMOS
Let me through! That's my son! My boy!


Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught.


INT. DARKENED ROOM

Mad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is
in the room still sobbing. They sit.

MAD-EYE
Are you alright Potter?

Harry nods.

MAD-EYE
Does it hurt?

HARRY
Not so much now.

MAD-EYE
I'd better take a look at it.

We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking.

HARRY
The cup was a portkey. Someone had bewitched
it.

MAD-EYE
What was it like? What was he like?


HARRY
Who?

MAD-EYE
The dark lord. What was it like to stand
in his presence?

HARRY
I dunno. It was like I'd fallen into
one of my dreams. One of my nightmares.


Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for
his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles
and struggles to find one.

MAD-EYE
Were there others? In the graveyard,
were there others?

HARRY
Um. I don't think I said anything about
a graveyard Professor.

MAD-EYE
Marvellous creatures dragons aren't
they? Do you think that miserable oaf
would have led you into the woods if
I hadn't suggested it? Do you think
Cedric Diggory would have told you to
hold the egg under the water if I hadn't
have told him first myself? Do you think
Neville Longbottom the witless wonder
could have provided you with gilliweed
if I hadn't have given him the book
that led you straight to it? Huh??


HARRY
It was you from the beginning. You put
my name in the goblet of fire. You bewitched
Krum. But...

Mad-Eye makes sobbing noises making fun of Harry.

MAD-EYE
You won because I made it so Potter.
You ended up in that graveyard tonight
because it was meant to be so. And now
the deed is done. The blood that runs
through these veins runs within the
dark lord. Imagine how he will reward
me when he learns that I have once and
for all silenced the great Harry Potter.


A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.
Dumbledore and Severus come rushing in. Dumbledore takes Mad-Eye
by the neck...

DUMBLEDORE
Severus...

Severus administers some veritaserum. Mad-Eye wriggles demonically.


DUMBLEDORE
Do you know who I am?

MAD-EYE
Albus Dumbledore.

DUMBLEDORE
Are you Alastor Moody? Are ya?

MAD-EYE
No.

DUMBLEDORE
Is he in this room? Is he in this room?


We see a nod.

DUMBLEDORE
Harry get away from there!

Dumbledore approaches the chest. The chest opens, it contains
a series of smaller chests. When the final chest is open we see
that there's a pit within holding a man the real Alastor Moody.


DUMBLEDORE
Are you alright Alastor?

ALASTOR
I'm sorry Albus.

HARRY
That's Moody, but then who's...?

Dumbledore holds up one of Mad-Eye's Bottles.

SEVERUS
Polyjuice potion.

DUMBLEDORE
Now we know who's been stealing it from
your store Severus.

Dumbledore looks into the pit.

DUMBLEDORE
We'll get you up in a minute.

Alastor Moody groans. The Mad-Eye Moody they have captive in
a chair begins to twitch about restlessly making strange noises.
He appears to be transforming. He rips off his fake eyepiece
which falls on the floor, we see that he's transformed into Barty
Crouch Junior.

DUMBLEDORE
Barty Crouch Junior.

BARTY JR
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.


Barty Jr rolls up his sleeve to reveal a skull and snake marking.


DUMBLEDORE
Your arm Harry.

BARTY JR
You know what this means don't you?
He's back. Lord Voldemort has returned.


DUMBLEDORE
Send an owl to Azkaban, think they'll
find they're missing a prisoner.


BARTY JR
I'll be welcomed back like a hero.


DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps. Personally I've never had much
time for heroes.


INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM

DUMBLEDORE
(Speaking to all pupils) Today we acknowledge
a really terrible loss. Cedric Diggory
was as you all know, exceptionally hard
working, intricately fair minded. And
most importantly a fierce fierce friend.
I think therefore you have the right
to know exactly how he died. You see,
Cedric Diggory was murdered by Lord
Voldemort. The ministry of magic does
not wish me to tell you this. But not
to do so I think would be an insult
to his memory. Now the pain we all feel
at this dreadful loss reminds me, reminds
us that while we may come from different
places and speak in different tongues,
our hearts beat as one. In light of
recent events the bonds of friendship
we made this year will be more important
than ever. Remember that and Cedric
Diggory will not have died in vain,
you remember that. And we'll celebrate
a boy who was kind and honest and brave
and true right to the very end.


INT. BEDROOM

Harry is sitting on a bed, Dumbledore walks in.

DUMBLEDORE
I never liked these curtains. Set them
on fire in my fourth year, by accident
of course. I put you in terrible danger
this year Harry I'm sorry.

HARRY
Professor, when I was in the graveyard
there was a moment... um... when Voldemort's
wand and mine sort of connected.

DUMBLEDORE
Priori Incantatem. You saw your parents
that night didn't you? They reappeared.


Harry nods.

DUMBLEDORE
No spell can reawaken the dead Harry
I trust you know that. Dark and diffiult
times lie ahead. Soon we must all face
the choice between what is right what
is easy. But remember this, you have
friends here. You're not alone.


EXT. HOGWARTS

There's a large crowd gathered, the pupils are going home. Viktor
Krum gives Hermione a kiss and hands her some paper.

VIKTOR
Write to me. Promise.

HERMIONE
Bye.

Ron is sitting alone. The french sisters approach him, they both
in turn give him a kiss on the head.

FLEUR
Au revoir Ron.

The Beauxbatons girls leave in uniform, the crowd applauds. The
Durmstrang boys leave too, shaking hands as they go.

RON
Do you think we'll ever just have a
quiet year at Hogwarts?

HERMIONE
No.

HARRY
No I don't think so.

HERMIONE
Everything's going to change now isn't
it?

HARRY
Yes.

HERMIONE
Promise you'll write this summer. Both
of you.

RON
Well I won't. You know I won't!

HERMIONE
Harry will won't you?

HARRY
Yeah. Every week.

They look over the balcony, the flying horses pulling a carriage
head off into the distance. The Bulgarians' ship goes underwater.

#####5
Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix script

I don't know about you, it's just too hot today, isn't it? 

And it's going to get even worse. Temperatures up in the mid-30s Celsius... 

...that's the mid-90s Fahrenheit, tomorrow, maybe even hitting 100. 

So, please, remember to cover up and stay cool... 

...with the hottest hits on your FM dial. 

Come on, guys, time to go home. 

Come on, love, off you get. 

- Do we have to? - Yes, we do. 

I'll make you your favorite dinner to compensate. 

He squealed like a pig, didn't he? 

Yeah, brilliant punch, Big D. Did you see his face? 

Hey, Big D. 

Beat up another 10-year-old? 

- This one deserved it. - Yeah. 

- Five against one, very brave. - Well, you're one to talk. 

Moaning in your sleep every night? At least I'm not afraid of my pillow. 

"Don't kill Cedric." 

Who's Cedric, your boyfriend? 

- Shut up. - "He's going to kill me, Mum." 

Where is your mum? 

Where is your mum, Potter? 

She dead? 

Is she dead? 

Is she a dead Pott...? 

- Dudley. - Dudley, let's go. 

- What's going on? - What are you doing? 

- I'm not doing anything. - We're getting out of here, Dudley. 

Come on, Dudley, hurry up. 

Dudley, run. 

Expecto Patronum. 

Mrs. Figg. 

Don't put away your wand, Harry. 

They might come back. 

Dementors in Little Whinging, whatever next? 

- Whole world's gone topsy-turvy. - I don't understand. How do you know...? 

Dumbledore asked me to keep an eye on you. 

Dumbledore asked you? You know Dumbledore? 

After You-Know-Who killed that poor Diggory boy last year... 

...did you expect him to let you go wandering on your own? 

Good Lord, boy. They told me you were intelligent. 

Now, get inside and stay there. 

Expect someone will be in touch soon. Whatever happens, don't leave the house. 

It is hot. That's right, hot everywhere. 

There's sweat. There's stifling. 

Diddykins? 

Is that you? 

Duddy. Vernon, come quick. 

We're going to have to take him to a hospital. 

Who did this to you, boy? 

Happy, are we, now? 

You've finally done it. You've finally driven him loopy. 

Vernon, don't say that. 

Well, just look at him, Petunia. Our boy has gone yumpy. 

I've reached my limit, do you hear? 

This is the last I'm gonna take of you and your nonsense. 

- Dear Mr. Potter. - What? 

The Ministry has received intelligence that at 6:23 this evening... 

...you performed the Patronus Charm in the presence of a Muggle. 

As a clear violation... 

...of the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery... 

...you are hereby expelled... 

...from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. 

Hoping you are well, Mafalda Hopkirk. 

Justice. 

He's not very well. 

Sorry, Hedwig. 

Very clean, these Muggles. 

- Tonks, for God's sake. - Unnatural. 

Professor Moody. 

- What are you doing here? - Rescuing you, of course. 

But where are we going? The letter said I've been expelled. 

You haven't been. Not yet. Kingsley, you take point. 

But the letter said... 

Dumbledore persuaded the minister to suspend your expulsion... 

...pending a formal hearing. - A hearing? 

Don't worry. We'll explain everything when we get back to headquarters. 

Not here, Nymphadora. 

Don't call me Nymphadora. 

Stay in formation, everyone. Don't break ranks if one of us is killed. 

Come on, you, around the corner. 

Come on. 

In you go, son. 

There've been no sightings. 

No deaths. No proof. 

He almost killed Harry. If that isn't proof enough... 

Yes, but guarding you-know-what is the most important... 

We must trust Dumbledore on this. 

Was he able to protect Harry last year? Well, tonight I say it's time to take action. 

Cornelius Fudge is a politician first and a wizard second. 

- His instinct would be to ignore it... - Keep your voices down. 

He's getting stronger and stronger by the minute. We have to act now. 

- Harry. - Mrs. Weasley. 

Heavens, you're all right. 

Bit peaky, but I'm afraid dinner will wait until after the meeting's finished. 

Nope. No time to explain. Straight upstairs, first door on the left. 

Yeah. 

Mudblood, werewolves, traitors, thieves. 

If my poor mistress knew the scum they let into her house... 

...what would she say to old Kreacher? 

Oh, the shame. 

- Freaks. - There, there, mistress. 

Scum of the earth. Not like it was in the days of my fathers. 

Kreacher is here. 

Oh, Harry. 

Are you all right? We overheard them talking about the Dementor attack. 

- You must tell us everything. - Let the man breathe, Hermione. 

And this hearing at the Ministry. It's just outrageous. 

I've looked it up. They simply can't expel you. 

- It's completely unfair. - Yeah. 

There's a lot of that going round at the moment. 

So, what is this place? 

- It's headquarters. - Of the Order of the Phoenix. 

It's a secret society. 

Dumbledore formed it back when they fought You-Know-Who. 

Couldn't have put any of this in a letter, I suppose? 

I've gone all summer without a scrap of news. 

We wanted to write, mate. Really, we did. 

- Only... - Only what? 

Only Dumbledore made us swear not to tell you anything. 

Dumbledore said that? 

But why would he keep me in the dark? Maybe I could help. 

I'm the one who saw Voldemort return... 

...the one who fought him, who saw Cedric Diggory get killed. 

- Harry. - Thought we heard your dulcet tones. 

- Don't bottle it up, though, mate. Let it out. - Lf you're all done shouting... 

Do you wanna hear something a little more interesting? 

If anyone has a right to know, it's Harry. If it wasn't for Harry... 

...we wouldn't even know voldemort was back. 

He's not a child, Molly. 

But he's not an adult either. 

- He's not James, Sirius. - Well, he's not your son. 

He's as good as. 

- Who else has he got? - Hey, Ginny. 

- He's got me. - How touchingly paternal, Black. 

Perhaps Potter will grow up to be a felon, just like his godfather. 

Now, you stay out of this, Snivellus. 

- Snape's part of the Order? - Git. 

- About your supposed reformation. 

- I know better. - So why don't you tell him? 

- Get off it. - Ouick. 

- Get it up. - Crookshanks. 

- Stop it. - Get off, you bloody cat. 

- Crookshanks. Leave it alone. - Get it up. 

- Hermione, I hate your cat. - Bad Crookshanks. 

Well, we'll be eating down in the kitchen. 

Just because you're allowed to use magic now... 

...does not mean you have to whip your wands out for everything. 

Hi, Mum. 

You hungry, Harry? 

You sure you're all right, Harry? Gave us quite a turn. 

Harry Potter. 

Sirius. 

This is very, very peculiar. 

It seems your hearing in the Ministry is to be before the entire Wizengamot. 

I don't understand. What has the Ministry of Magic got against me? 

Show him. He'll find out soon enough. 

 

He's been attacking Dumbledore as well. 

 

Fudge is using all his power, including his influence at the Daily Prophet... 

...to smear anyone who claims the Dark Lord has returned. 

Why? 

He thinks Dumbledore's after his job. 

No one in their right mind could believe that... 

Exactly the point. Fudge isn't in his right mind. 

It's been twisted and warped by fear. 

Now, fear makes people do terrible things, Harry. 

The last time Voldemort gained power... 

...he almost destroyed everything we hold most dear. 

Now he's returned, and I'm afraid the minister will do almost anything... 

...to avoid facing that terrifying truth. 

We think Voldemort wants to build up his army again. 

Fourteen years ago, he had huge numbers at his command. 

And not just witches and wizards, but all manner of dark creatures. 

He's been recruiting heavily, and we've been attempting to do the same. 

But gathering followers isn't the only thing he's interested in. 

We believe... 

...Voldemort may be after something. 

Sirius. 

Something he didn't have last time. 

You mean like a weapon? 

No. That's enough. He's just a boy. 

You say more and you might as well induct him into the Order. 

Good. I want to join. If Voldemort's raising an army, then I want to fight. 

Harry. 

You are hereby expelled. 

Before the entire Wizengamot. 

Trains. Underground. 

Ingenious, these Muggles. 

Here we are. 

I've never used the visitors' entrance before. Should be fun. 

Right. Good. I'll just get my Muggle money. 

Terrible. Lost a lot of Galleons trading on the potions market. 

Daily Prophet, ladies and gentlemen. Anybody for Daily Prophet? 

Dumbledore: Is he daft, or is he dangerous? 

- Morning, Arthur. - Morning, Bob. 

Interdepartmental memos. 

We used to use owls. Mess was unbelievable. 

Merlin's beard. Thank you, Kingsley. 

- They've changed the time of your hearing. - When is it? 

In five minutes. 

Department of Mysteries. 

And I'm confident, minister, that you will do the right thing. 

Yes, but we must be... 

Remember, during the hearing, speak only when you're spoken to. 

Keep calm. You've done nothing wrong. 

As the Muggles say, truth will out. 

Yes? 

I'm not allowed in, I'm afraid. 

Good luck, Harry. 

Disciplinary hearing of the 12th of August... 

...into offenses committed by Harry James Potter... 

...resident at Number 4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey. 

Interrogators: Cornelius Oswald Fudge, Minister of Mag... 

Witness for the defense. 

Albus Percival Wulfric... ...Brian Dumbledore. 

You got our message that the time and place of the hearing... 

...had been changed, did you? - I must have missed it. 

But by a happy mistake, I arrived at the Ministry three hours early. 

The charges? 

The charges against the accused are as follows: 

"That he did knowingly... 

...and in full awareness of the illegality of his actions... 

...produce a Patronus Charm... 

...in the presence of a Muggle." 

- Do you deny producing said Patronus? - No, but... 

And you were aware that you were forbidden to use magic outside school... 

...while under the age of 17? - Yes, I was, but... 

Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot... 

I was only doing it because of the Dementors. 

Dementors? 

In Little Whinging? 

That's quite clever. 

Muggles can't see Dementors, can they, boy? 

- Highly convenient. - I'm not lying. 

- There were two of them, and if I hadn't... - Enough. 

I'm sorry to interrupt what I'm sure would have been a very well-rehearsed story... 

...but since you can produce no witnesses of the event... 

Pardon me, minister, but as it happens, we can. 

Please describe the attack. 

What did they look like? 

Well, one of them was very large and the other rather skinny. 

Not the boys. The Dementors. 

Oh, right, right. Well, big. 

Cloaked. Then everything went cold... 

...as though all the happiness had gone from the world. 

Now, look here. Dementors don't just wander into a Muggle suburb... 

...and happen across a wizard. The odds are astronomical. 

I don't think anyone would believe... 

...the Dementors were there by coincidence, minister. 

I'm sure I must have misunderstood you, professor. 

Dementors are, after all, under the control of the Ministry of Magic. 

And it's so silly of me, but it sounded for a moment as though... 

...you were suggesting that the Ministry had ordered the attack on this boy. 

That would be disturbing indeed, Madam Undersecretary... 

...which is why I'm sure the Ministry will be mounting a full-scale inquiry... 

...into why the two Dementors were so very far from Azkaban... 

...and why they mounted an attack without authorization. 

Of course, there is someone... 

...who might be behind the attack. 

Cornelius, I implore you to see reason. 

The evidence that the Dark Lord has returned is incontrovertible. 

He is not back. 

In the matter of Harry Potter... 

...the law clearly states... 

...that magic may be used before Muggles in life-threatening situations. 

Laws can be changed if necessary, Dumbledore. 

Clearly. Has it become practice to hold a full criminal trial... 

...to deal with a simple matter of underage magic? 

Those in favor of conviction? 

Those in favor of clearing the accused of all charges? 

Cleared of all charges. 

Professor. 

Padfoot. Are you barking mad? 

You'll blow the entire operation. 

Sirius, what are you doing here? If somebody sees you... 

I had to see you off, didn't I? 

What's life without a little risk? 

I don't wanna see you get chucked back in Azkaban. 

Don't worry about me. 

Anyway, I wanted you to have this. 

Original Order of the Phoenix. 

Marlene McKinnon. 

She was killed two weeks after this was taken. 

Voldemort wiped out her entire family. 

Frank and Alice Longbottom. 

Neville's parents. 

They suffered a fate worse than death, you ask me. 

It's been 14 years. 

And still a day doesn't go by I don't miss your dad. 

Do you really think there's going to be a war, Sirius? 

It feels like it did before. 

You keep it. 

Anyway, I suppose you're the young ones now. 

I'll see you at the train. 

Bye-bye, darling. 

I love you. 

Hold my hand, lovey. 

There they are. They're in the far carriage. 

Bye. 

I'm surprised the Ministry's still letting you walk around free. 

Better enjoy it while you can. 

I expect there's a cell in Azkaban with your name on it. 

- What'd I tell you? Complete nutter. - Just stay away from me! 

It's only Malfoy. 

What'd you expect? 

Hi, guys. 

- Hey, Neville. - Hey there, Neville. 

What is it? 

- What's what? - That. Pulling the carriage. 

Nothing's pulling the carriage, Harry. 

It's pulling itself, like always. 

You're not going mad. 

I can see them too. 

You're just as sane as I am. 

Everyone, this is Loony Love... 

Luna Lovegood. 

What an interesting necklace. 

It's a charm, actually. 

Keeps away the Nargles. 

Hungry. 

I hope there's pudding. 

- What's a Nargle? - No idea. 

Good evening, children. 

Now, we have two changes in staffing this year. 

We're pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank... 

...who'll be taking Care of Magical Creatures... 

...while Professor Hagrid is on temporary leave. 

We also wish to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher... 

...Professor Dolores Umbridge. 

And I'm sure you'll all join me in wishing the professor good luck. 

Now, as usual, our caretaker, Mr. Filch, has asked me to remind you... 

She was at my hearing. She works for Fudge. 

Thank you, headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. 

And how lovely to see all your bright... 

...happy faces smiling up at me. 

I'm sure we're all going to be very good friends. 

- That's likely. - That's likely. 

The Ministry of Magic has always considered... 

...the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. 

Although each headmaster... 

...has brought something new to this historic school... 

...progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. 

Let us preserve what must be preserved... 

...perfect what can be perfected... 

...and prune practices that ought to be prohibited. 

Thank you, Professor Umbridge. That really was most illuminating. 

- Illuminating? What a load of waffle. - What's it mean? 

Magic is forbidden in the corridors... 

It means the Ministry's interfering at Hogwarts. 

Dean, Seamus. 

- Good holiday? - All right. 

Better than Seamus', anyway. 

Me mum didn't want me to come back this year. 

- Why not? - Let me see. Because of you. 

The Daily Prophet's been saying a lot of things about you and Dumbledore. 

What, your mum believes them? 

Nobody was there the night Cedric died. 

I guess you should read the Prophet, then, like your stupid mother. 

- Don't talk about my mother. - I'll have a go at anyone that calls me a liar. 

- What's going on? - He's mad, is what's going on. 

Do you believe the rubbish he's come out with about You-Know-Who? 

Yeah. I do. 

Has anyone else got a problem with Harry? 

- You all right? - Fine. 

Seamus was bang out of order, mate. 

- But he'll come through, you'll see. - I said, I'm fine, Ron. 

Right. I'll just leave you to your thoughts, then. 

Harry. 

Bring it over here. Over here. 

Oh, go on, Seamus. Go on, get it. 

Good morning, children. 

Ordinary Wizarding Level examinations. 

O-W-Ls. O-W-Ls. 

More commonly known as OWLs. 

Study hard and you will be rewarded. 

Fail to do so, and the consequences may be severe. 

Your previous instruction in this subject has been disturbingly uneven. 

But you'll be pleased to know, from now on... 

...you will be following a carefully structured, Ministry-approved... 

...course of defensive magic. Yes? 

There's nothing in here about using defensive spells? 

Using spells? 

Well, I can't imagine why you would need to use spells in my classroom. 

We're not gonna use magic? 

You'll be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way. 

What use is that? If we're attacked, it won't be risk-free. 

Students will raise their hands when they speak in my class. 

It is the view of the Ministry... 

...that a theoretical knowledge will be sufficient... 

...to get you through your examinations... 

...which, after all, is what school is all about. 

And how's theory supposed to prepare us for what's out there? 

There is nothing out there, dear. 

Who do you imagine wants to attack children like yourself? 

Oh, I don't know. Maybe Lord Voldemort. 

Now, let me make this quite plain. 

You have been told... 

...that a certain dark wizard is at large once again. 

- This is a lie. - It's not a lie. I saw him. I fought him. 

Detention, Mr. Potter. 

Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord? 

Cedric Diggory's death was a tragic accident. 

It was murder. Voldemort killed him. 

Enough! 

Enough. 

See me later, Mr. Potter. My office. 

Come in. 

Good evening, Mr. Potter. 

Sit. 

You're going to be doing some lines for me today, Mr. Potter. 

No, not with your quill. 

Going to be using a rather special one of mine. 

Now... 

...I want you to write, "I must not tell lies." 

How many times? 

Well, let's say for as long as it takes for the message to sink in. 

You haven't given me any ink. 

Oh, you won't need any ink. 

Yes? 

- Nothing. - That's right. 

Because you know, deep down... 

...you deserve to be punished. 

Don't you, Mr. Potter? 

Go on. 

- Skiving Snackboxes. - Sweets that make you ill. 

Get out of class whenever you like. 

Obtain hours of pleasure from unprofitable boredom. 

Care for another? 

- I'm not asking you to write all of it for me. - Please. 

I've been busy studying for these stupid OWL exams. 

I'll do the introduction. That's all. 

Hermione, you're honestly the most wonderful person I've ever met. 

- And if I'm ever rude to you again... - I'll know you've gone back to normal. 

What's wrong with your hand? 

Nothing. 

The other hand. 

- You've got to tell Dumbledore. - No. 

Dumbledore's got enough on his mind right now. 

I don't want to give Umbridge the satisfaction. 

Bloody hell, Harry. The woman's torturing you. 

- Lf the parents knew about this... - I haven't got any of those, have I, Ron? 

Harry, you've got to report this. 

- It's perfectly simple. You're being... - No, it's not. 

Hermione, whatever this is, it's not simple. 

You don't understand. 

Then help us to. 

Dear Padfoot... 

...I hope you're all right. 

It's starting to get colder here. Winter is definitely on the way. 

In spite of being back at Hogwarts, I feel more alone than ever. 

I know you, of all people, will understand. 

Hello, Harry Potter. 

- Your feet. Aren't they cold? - Bit. 

Unfortunately, all my shoes have mysteriously disappeared. 

I suspect Nargles are behind it. 

- What are they? - They're called Thestrals. 

They're quite gentle, really, but people avoid them because they're a bit... 

Different. 

But why can't the others see them? 

They can only be seen by people who've seen death. 

So you've known someone who's died, then? 

My mum. 

She was quite an extraordinary witch, but she did like to experiment... 

...and one day, one of her spells went badly wrong. 

- I was 9. - I'm sorry. 

Yes, it was rather horrible. 

I do feel very sad about it sometimes, but I've got Dad. 

We both believe you, by the way. 

That He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named is back, and you fought him... 

...and the Ministry and the Prophet are conspiring against you. 

Thanks. It seems you're about the only ones that do. 

I don't think that's true. 

But I suppose that's how he wants you to feel. 

What do you mean? 

Well, if I were You-Know-Who... 

...l'd want you to feel cut off from everyone else... 

...because if it's just you alone... 

...you're not as much of a threat. 

- Do you ever stop eating? - What? I'm hungry. 

Harry. 

Can I join you? 

Pardon me, professor, but what exactly are you insinuating? 

I am merely requesting that when it comes to my students... 

...you conform to the prescribed disciplinary practices. 

So silly of me, but it sounds... 

...as if you're questioning my authority in my own classroom... 

...Minerva. 

Not at all, Dolores, merely your medieval methods. 

I am sorry, dear. 

But to question my practices is to question the Ministry... 

...and by extension, the minister himself. 

I am a tolerant woman... 

...but the one thing I will not stand for is disloyalty. 

Disloyalty. 

Things at Hogwarts are far worse than I feared. 

Cornelius will want to take immediate action. 

 

What's happened to Dumbledore? 

Having already revolutionized... 

...the teaching of Defense Against the Dark Arts... 

...Dolores Umbridge will, as high inquisitor, have powers... 

...to address the seriously falling standards at Hogwarts School. 

Just one question, dear. 

You've been in this post how long, exactly? 

You applied first for the Defense Against the Dark Arts post, is that correct? 

Yes. 

But you were unsuccessful? 

Obviously. 

 

Could you please predict something for me? 

I'm sorry? 

Move those mouths. 

One teensy little prophecy? 

Pity. 

No, wait. Wait, no. I think I do see something. 

Yes, I do. Something dark. 

You are in grave danger. 

Lovely. 

Cho. What's going on? 

It's Professor Trelawney. 

Sixteen years I've lived and taught here. 

Hogwarts is my home. 

You can't do this. 

Actually, I can. 

Something you'd like to say? 

Oh, there are several things I would like to say. 

There... 

Professor McGonagall, might I ask you to escort Sybil back inside? 

Sybil, dear. This way. 

Thank you. 

Dumbledore, may I remind you that under the terms... 

...of Educational Decree Number 23, as enacted by the minister... 

You have the right to dismiss my teachers. 

You do not, however, have the authority to banish them from the grounds. 

That power remains with the headmaster. 

For now. 

Don't you all have studying to do? 

Professor. 

Professor? 

Professor Dumbledore. Professor! 

Professor Dumbledore. 

That foul, evil, old gargoyle. 

We're not learning how to defend ourselves. We're not learning how to pass our OWLs. 

She's taking over the entire school. 

Security has been and will remain the Ministry's top priority. 

Furthermore, we have convincing evidence... 

...that these disappearances are the work... 

...of notorious mass murderer Sirius Black. 

Harry. 

Sirius. 

- What are you doing here? - Answering your letter. 

You said you were worried about Umbridge. What's she doing? 

Training you to kill half-breeds? 

- She's not letting us use magic at all. - Well, I'm not surprised. 

The latest intelligence is that Fudge doesn't want you trained in combat. 

Combat? 

What does he think, we're forming some sort of wizard army? 

That's exactly what he thinks. 

That Dumbledore is assembling his own forces to take on the Ministry. 

He's becoming more paranoid by the minute. 

The others wouldn't want me telling you this, Harry... 

...but things aren't going at all well with the Order. 

Fudge is blocking the truth at every turn... 

...and these disappearances are just how it started before. 

Voldemort is on the move. 

Well, what can we do? 

Someone's coming. 

I'm sorry I can't be of more help. 

But for now, at least, it looks like you're on your own. 

He really is out there, isn't he? 

We've got to be able to defend ourselves. 

And if Umbridge refuses to teach us how, we need someone who will. 

Harry. 

This is mad. Who'd wanna be taught by me? 

I'm a nutter, remember? 

Look on the bright side: You can't be any worse than old toad face. 

- Thanks, Ron. - I'm here for you, mate. 

Who's supposed to be meeting us, then? 

Just a couple of people. 

Lovely spot. 

Thought it would be safer off the beaten track. 

Matey, come back here. 

Hi. 

So you all know why we're here. 

We need a teacher. 

A proper teacher. 

One who's had experience defending themselves against the Dark Arts. 

- Why? - Why? 

Because You-Know-Who's back, you tosspot. 

- So he says. - So Dumbledore says. 

So Dumbledore says because he says. 

The point is, where's the proof? 

If Potter could tell us more about how Diggory got killed... 

I'm not gonna talk about Cedric, so if that's why you're here, clear out now. 

Come on, Hermione. They're here because they think I'm some sort of freak. 

Is it true you can produce a Patronus Charm? 

Yes. 

I've seen it. 

Blimey, Harry. I didn't know you could do that. 

And he killed a basilisk, with the sword in Dumbledore's office. 

It's true. 

Third year, he fought off about a hundred Dementors at once. 

Last year, he really did fight off You-Know-Who in the flesh. 

Wait. 

Look, it all sounds great when you say it like that... 

...but the truth is, most of that was just luck. 

I didn't know what I was doing half the time. I nearly always had help. 

- He's just being modest. - No, Hermione, I'm not. 

Facing this stuff in real life is not like school. 

In school, if you make a mistake, you can just try again tomorrow. 

But out there... 

...when you're a second away from being murdered... 

...or watching a friend die right before your eyes... 

You don't know what that's like. 

You're right, Harry, we don't. 

That's why we need your help. 

Because if we're going to have any chance at beating... 

...Voldemort... 

He's really back. 

Right. First we need to find a place to practice... ...where Umbridge won't find out. 

- The Shrieking Shack. - It's too small. 

- Forbidden Forest? - Not bloody likely. 

Harry, what happens if Umbridge does find out? 

Who cares? 

I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules? 

Who are you and what have you done with Hermione? 

Anyway, at least we know one positive thing that came from today. 

What's that? 

Cho couldn't take her eyes off you, could she? 

Right. Over the next few days, we should each come up... 

...with a couple of possibilities of places we can practice. 

We've got to make sure, wherever it is, there's no chance she can find us. 

Will do, Harry. 

All student organizations are henceforth disbanded. 

Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. 

Watch where you're going, Longbottom. 

You've done it, Neville. You found the Room of Requirement. 

The what? 

It's also known as the Come and Go Room. 

The Room of Requirement only appears when a person has real need of it. 

And it's always equipped for the seeker's needs. 

So say you really needed the toilet... 

Charming, Ronald. But, yes, that is the general idea. 

It's brilliant. It's like Hogwarts wants us to fight back. 

Expelliarmus. 

I'm hopeless. 

You're just flourishing your wand too much. Try it like this. Expelliarmus. 

You will please copy the approved text four times... 

...to ensure maximum retention. 

- There will be no need to talk. - No need to think's more like it. 

- Expelliarmus. - Wands away. 

Stunning is one of the most useful spells in your arsenal. 

It's a wizard's bread and butter, really. 

So come on, then, Nigel. Give it your best shot. 

Stupefy! 

Good. Not bad at all, Nigel. Well done. 

Don't worry. I'll go easy on you. 

Thanks, Ronald. 

- Come on, Ron. - Come on, Ron. 

- You can do it. - Come on, Ron. 

- One Sickle. - You're on. 

Stupefy. 

- Thank you. - Shut up. 

I let her do that. It's good manners, isn't it? 

It was completely intentional. 

 

Up you come. Would you like a cup of tea? 

Now, focus on a fixed point and try again. 

Expelliarmus. 

Very good. Keep your concentration. 

Great. 

A little higher. 

I'm okay. I'm okay. 

- Stupefy. - Stupefy. 

Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... 

...may sign up in the high inquisitor's office. 

Diminuendo. 

Working hard is important, but there's something that matters even more: 

Believing in yourself. 

- Expelliarmus. - Levicorpus. Got it. 

Think of it this way. 

Every great wizard in history has started out... 

...as nothing more than what we are now: Students. 

If they can do it, why not us? 

- Stupefy. - Expelliarmus. 

Expelliarmus. 

Expelliarmus. 

Reducto. 

- Expelliarmus. - Expelliarmus. 

Expelliarmus. 

Expelliarmus. 

Fantastic, Neville. Well done, man. 

So that's it for this lesson. 

Now, we're not gonna be meeting again until after the holidays. 

So just keep practicing on your own as best you can. 

And well done, everyone. Great, great work. 

Well done, mate. 

Thanks. 

See you after Christmas. 

See you in the Common Room, Harry. 

- Thanks a lot, Harry. - No worries. 

- Thank you so much. - Not at all. Merry Christmas. 

- Thank you, Harry. - Thank you. Merry Christmas. 

- Merry Christmas. - Have a good Christmas. 

- Have a great Christmas, Luna. - We've been thinking. 

We could always slip Umbridge some Puking Pastilles. 

Or Fever Fudge. They give you massive, pus-filled boils... 

Sounds great, guys. Would you excuse me? 

Are you all right? I heard Umbridge gave you a rough time the other day. 

Yeah. I'm okay. 

Anyway, it's worth it. 

It's just, learning all this... 

...makes me wonder whether, if he'd known it... 

Cedric did know this stuff. 

He was really good. 

It's just, Voldemort was better. 

You're a really good teacher, Harry. 

I've never been able to stun anything before. 

Mistletoe. 

Probably full of Nargles, though. 

What are Nargles? 

No idea. 

Well, how was it? 

Wet. 

I mean, she was sort of crying. 

That bad at it, are you? 

I'm sure Harry's kissing was more than satisfactory. 

Cho spends half her time crying these days. 

You'd think a bit of snogging would cheer her up. 

Don't you understand how she must be feeling? 

Well, obviously she's feeling sad about Cedric... 

...and confused about liking Harry and guilty about kissing him... 

...conflicted because Umbridge might sack her mum from the Ministry... 

...and frightened of failing her OWLs because she's worrying about everything. 

One person couldn't feel all that. They'd explode. 

Just because you've got the emotional range of a teaspoon... 

Harry. 

Voldemort may be after something. 

Something he didn't have last time. 

Harry. 

Harry. 

In the dream, were you standing next to the victim... 

...or looking down at the scene? 

Neither. It was like I... 

Will you please just tell me what's happening? 

Everard, Arthur's on guard duty tonight. 

Make sure he's found by the right people. 

- Sir. - Phineas. 

You must go to your portrait at Grimmauld Place. 

Tell them that Arthur Weasley is gravely injured... 

...and his children will be arriving there soon by Portkey. 

They've got him, Albus. It was close, but they think he'll make it. 

What's more, the Dark Lord failed to acquire it. 

Oh, thank goodness. Next we need to... 

Look at me! 

What's happening to me? 

You wished to see me, headmaster? 

Oh, Severus. I'm afraid we can't wait. Not even till the morning. 

Otherwise, we'll all be vulnerable. 

It appears there's a connection... 

...between the Dark Lord's mind and your own. 

Whether he is, as yet, aware of this connection is, for the moment, unclear. 

Pray he remains ignorant. 

You mean, if he knows about it, then... 

...he'll be able to read my mind? - Read it, control it... 

...unhinge it. 

In the past, it was often the Dark Lord's pleasure... 

...to invade the minds of his victims... 

...creating visions designed to torture them into madness. 

Only after extracting the last exquisite ounce of agony... 

...only when he had them literally begging for death, would he finally... 

...kill them. 

Used properly, the power of Occlumency... 

...will help shield you from access or influence. 

In these lessons, I will attempt to penetrate your mind. 

You will attempt to resist. 

Prepare yourself. 

Legilimens. 

Concentrate, Potter. Focus. 

Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas. 

Here we go. 

Daddy's back. 

Sit down, everybody, sit down. That's it. Now, presents. 

- And a nice big box for Ron. - Big box for you. And... 

Fred and George. Come on, open up. 

- I want to see your faces. - Yes. 

- Try it on. - Thanks, Mum. It's perfect. 

- Just what he wanted, actually. - Yeah. Right. Thanks, Mum. 

Come on, then, everybody. Let's clear this away. 

Oh, Harry, Harry. 

There you are. 

- Happy Christmas. - Thank you. 

- Lovely to have you with us. - Thank you. 

Now, Daddy. Pass that to Daddy. 

- Thank you. - Has everybody got? 

Fred? George? 

- Hermione. - A Christmas toast. 

To Mr. Harry Potter... 

...without whom I would not be here. 

- Harry. - Harry. 

Harry. 

That is delicious. I shall be needing some more of that. 

Daddy, don't forget last Christmas. 

I can't understand why you don't want to wear it, Ronald. 

I look like a bloody idiot, that's why. 

No more than usual, Ron. 

I don't know why... 

Nasty brat, standing there as bold as brass. 

Harry Potter, the boy who stopped the Dark Lord. 

Friend of Mudbloods and blood-traitors alike. 

- Lf my poor mistress only knew... - Kreacher! 

That's enough of your bile. Away with you! 

Of course, master. 

Kreacher lives to serve the noble house of Black. 

Sorry about that. 

He never was very pleasant, even when I was a boy. 

Not to me, anyway. 

What, you grew up here? 

This is my parents' house. 

I offered it to Dumbledore as headquarters for the Order. 

About the only useful thing I've been able to do. 

This is the Black family tree. 

My deranged cousin. 

I hated the lot of them. 

My parents with their pure-blood mania. 

My mother did that after I ran away. 

Charming woman. 

I was 16. 

Where did you go? 

Round your dad's. 

I was always welcome at the Potters'. 

I see him so much in you, Harry. 

You are so very much alike. 

I'm not so sure. 

Sirius, when I was... 

When I saw Mr. Weasley attacked, I wasn't just watching. 

I was the snake. 

And afterwards, in Dumbledore's office... 

...there was a moment when I wanted to... 

This connection between me and Voldemort. 

What if the reason for it is that I am becoming more like him? 

I just feel so angry all the time. 

And what if, after everything that I've been through... 

...something's gone wrong inside me? What if I'm becoming bad? 

I want you to listen to me very carefully, Harry. 

You're not a bad person. 

You're a very good person who bad things have happened to. 

You understand? 

Besides, the world isn't split into good people and Death Eaters. 

We've all got both light and dark inside of us. 

What matters is the part we choose to act on. 

That's who we really are. 

Harry, time to go. 

When all this is over, we'll be a proper family. 

You'll see. 

Come on. 

Really? 

Harry. Harry. 

Hagrid's back. 

I'm sorry. 

I will say this one last time. 

I'm ordering you to tell me where you've been. 

I told you. I've been away for me health. 

- Your health? - Yeah. Bit of fresh air, you know. 

Oh, yes. As gamekeeper, fresh air must be difficult to come by. 

If I were you, I shouldn't get too used to being back. 

In fact, I mightn't bother unpacking at all. 

This is top-secret, right? 

Dumbledore sent me to parley with the giants. 

Giants? 

You found them? 

Well, they're not that hard to find, to be perfectly honest. They're so big, see? 

I tried to convince them to join the cause. 

But I wasn't the only one that was trying to win them over. 

- Death Eaters? - Yes. 

Trying to persuade them to join You-Know-Who. 

- Did they? - I gave them Dumbledore's message. 

Suppose some of them remember he was friendly to them. I suppose. 

And they did this to you? 

Not exactly, no. 

Oh, go on, you have it, then, you dozy dog. 

It's changing out there. 

Just like last time. 

There's a storm coming, Harry. 

We'd all best be ready when she does. 

We have confirmed that 10 high-security prisoners... 

...in the early hours of yesterday evening did escape. 

And of course, the Muggle prime minister has been alerted to the danger. 

We strongly suspect... 

...that the breakout was engineered... 

...by a man with personal experience in escaping from Azkaban... 

...notorious mass murderer Sirius Black... 

...cousin of escapee Bellatrix Lestrange. 

Dumbledore warned Fudge this could happen. 

He's gonna get us all killed just because he can't face the truth. 

Harry. 

I wanted to apologize. 

Now even me mum says the Prophet's version of things don't add up. 

So, what I'm really trying to say is that I believe you. 

Neville? 

Fourteen years ago... 

...a Death Eater named Bellatrix Lestrange... 

...used a Cruciatus Curse on my parents. 

She tortured them for information... 

...but they never gave in. 

I'm quite proud to be their son. 

But I'm not sure I'm ready for everyone to know just yet. 

We're gonna make them proud, Neville. That's a promise. 

Make it a powerful memory, the happiest you can remember. 

Allow it to fill you up. Keep trying, Seamus. 

George, your turn now. 

Expecto Patronum. 

A full-bodied Patronus is the most difficult to produce... 

...but shield forms can also be equally useful against a variety of opponents. 

Wow, that was really good. 

Fantastic, Ginny. 

Just remember, your Patronus can only protect you for as long as you stay focused. 

So focus, Luna. 

Think of the happiest thing you can. 

Expecto Patronum. 

- I'm trying. - I know. It's good. 

This is really advanced stuff, guys. You're doing so well. 

Expecto Patronum. 

I'll make short work of this. 

Bombarda Maxima. 

Get them. 

Been watching them for weeks. 

And see, "Dumbledore's Army"... 

...proof of what I've been telling you right from the beginning, Cornelius. 

All your fear-mongering about You-Know-Who... 

...never fooled us for a minute. 

We saw your lies for what they were: 

A smokescreen for your bid to seize control of the Ministry. 

Naturally. 

No, professor. He had nothing to do with it. It was me. 

Most noble of you, Harry, to shield me, but as has been pointed out... 

...the parchment clearly says "Dumbledore's Army," not "Potter's." 

I instructed Harry to form this organization. 

And I, and I alone, am responsible for its activities. 

Dispatch an owl to the Daily Prophet. 

If we hurry, we should still make the morning edition. 

Dawlish, Shacklebolt, you will escort Dumbledore... 

...to Azkaban... 

...to await trial for conspiracy and sedition. 

I thought we might hit this little snag. 

You seem to be laboring under the delusion that I'm going to... 

What was the phrase? 

- Come quietly. 

Well, I can tell you this: 

I have no intention of going to Azkaban. 

Enough of this. 

Take him. 

Well, you may not like him, minister... 

...but you can't deny... 

...Dumbledore has got style. 

 

Boys and girls are not permitted to be within eight inches of each other. 

Those wishing to join the Inquisitorial Squad for extra credit... 

Students will be submitted to questioning about suspected illicit activities. 

Any student in noncompliance will be expelled. 

Harry. 

You did everything you could. No one could win against that old hag. 

Even Dumbledore didn't see this coming. 

Harry, if it's anyone's fault, it's ours. 

Yeah, we talked you into it. 

Yeah, but I agreed. 

I tried so hard to help, and all it's done is make things worse. 

Anyway, that doesn't matter anymore. 

Because I don't want to play anymore. All it does is make you care too much. 

And the more you care, the more you have to lose. 

- So maybe it's just better to... - To what? 

To go it alone. 

Hagrid. 

Any idea where he's taking us? 

Hagrid, why can't you just tell us? 

I've never seen the centaurs so riled. 

And they're dangerous at the best of times. 

The Ministry restricts their territory much more... 

...they'll have a full uprising on their hands. 

Hagrid, what's going on? 

I'm sorry to be so mysterious, you three. 

I wouldn't be bothering you at all with it, but with Dumbledore gone... 

...l'll likely be getting the sack any day now. 

And I just couldn't leave without telling someone about him. 

Grawpy. 

Down here, you great buffoon. 

Grawpy. 

Brought you some company. 

I couldn't just leave him, because... 

Because he's my brother. 

Blimey. 

Well, half brother, really. 

He's completely harmless, just like I said. Little high-spirited, is all. 

- Grawpy, that is not polite. - Hagrid, do something. 

We talked about this. You do not grab, do you? 

That's your new friend, Hermione. 

Grawpy. 

Grawp. 

Put me down. 

Now. 

You all right? 

Fine. 

Just needs a firm hand, is all. 

I think you've got an admirer. 

You just stay away from her, all right? 

He gets his own food and all. 

It's company he'll be needing when I'm gone. 

You will look after him, won't you? 

I'm the only family he's got. 

Feeling sentimental? 

- That's private. - Not to me. 

And not to the Dark Lord, if you don't improve. 

Every memory he has access to is a weapon he can use against you. 

You won't last two seconds if he invades your mind. 

You're just like your father. 

Lazy, arrogant. 

- Don't say a word against my father. - Weak. 

- I'm not weak. - Then prove it. 

Control your emotions. 

Discipline your mind. 

Legilimens. 

Harry. 

Sirius. 

I may vomit. 

Stop it. 

Is this what you call control? 

We've been at it for hours. If I could just rest. 

The Dark Lord isn't resting. 

You and Black, you're two of a kind. 

Sentimental children forever whining about how bitterly unfair your lives have been. 

Well, it may have escaped your notice, but life isn't fair. 

Your blessed father knew that. In fact, he frequently saw to it. 

- My father was a great man. - Your father was a swine. 

- Legilimens. - Protego. 

Come on, Moony, Padfoot. 

Snape. Expelliarmus. 

Nice one, James. 

- Dad. - Impedimenta. 

Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. 

Right. Who wants to see me take off Snivelly's trousers? 

Snivellus Greasy. Snivellus Greasy. 

Enough. 

Enough. 

Your lessons are at an end. 

L... 

Get out. 

- What's your name? - Michael. 

Your hand's gonna be fine, Michael. 

Yeah. It's not as bad as it seems. See? 

It's fading already. 

You can hardly see ours anymore, and the pain stops after a while. 

As I told you once before, Mr. Potter... 

...naughty children deserve to be punished. 

You know, George... 

...l've always felt our futures lay outside the world of academic achievement. 

Fred, I've been thinking exactly the same thing. 

 

All right, professor! 

Here you go. 

Ready when you are. 

I need that prophecy. 

You'll have to kill me. 

Oh, I will. But first, you will fetch it for me. 

Crucio. 

Crucio. 

Sirius. 

Harry, are you sure? 

I saw it. It's just like with Mr. Weasley. 

It's the door I've been dreaming about. 

I couldn't remember where I'd seen it before. 

Sirius said Voldemort was after something. 

Something he didn't have the last time, in the Department of Mysteries. 

Harry, please, just listen. 

What if Voldemort meant for you to see this? 

What if he's only hurting Sirius because he's trying to get to you? 

What if he is? I'm supposed to just let him die? 

Hermione, he's the only family I've got left. 

What do we do? 

We'll have to use the Floo Network. 

Umbridge has the chimneys under surveillance. 

Not all of them. 

Alohomora. 

Alert the Order if you can. 

- Are you mental? We're going with you. - It's too dangerous. 

When are you going to get it into your head? We're in this together. 

That you are. 

Caught this one trying to help the Weasley girl. 

You were going to Dumbledore, weren't you? 

- No. - Liar. 

- You sent for me, headmistress? - Snape, yes. 

The time has come for answers, whether he wants to give them to me or not. 

Have you brought the Veritaserum? 

I'm afraid you've used up all my stores interrogating students. 

The last of it on Miss Chang. 

Unless you wish to poison him... 

And I assure you, I would have the greatest sympathy if you did. 

- I cannot help you. 

He's got Padfoot. 

He's got Padfoot at the place where it's hidden. 

Padfoot? What is Padfoot? Where what is hidden? 

What is he talking about, Snape? 

No idea. 

Very well. 

You give me no choice, Potter. 

As this is an issue of Ministry security... 

...you leave me with... 

...no alternative. 

The Cruciatus Curse ought to loosen your tongue. 

That's illegal. 

What Cornelius doesn't know won't hurt him. 

Tell her, Harry! 

Tell me what? 

Well, if you won't tell her where it is... 

...I will. 

Where what is? 

Dumbledore's secret weapon. 

How much further? 

Not far. 

It had to be somewhere students wouldn't find it accidentally. 

What are you doing? 

Lmprovising. 

Well? 

Where is this weapon? 

There isn't one, is there? 

You were trying to trick me. 

You know... 

...I really hate children. 

You have no business here, centaur. This is a Ministry matter. 

Lower your weapons. 

I warn you, under the law, as creatures of near-human intelligence... 

Protego. 

How dare you? 

Filthy half-breed. 

Incarcerous. 

Please. Please stop it. Please. 

Now, enough. I will have order. 

You filthy animal. 

Do you know who I am? 

Leave him alone. It's not his fault. 

No, he doesn't understand. 

Potter, do something. Tell them I mean no harm. 

I'm sorry, professor. 

But I must not tell lies. 

What are you doing? 

I am Senior Undersecretary Dolores Jane Umbridge. 

Let me go! 

Thank you, Grawp. 

Hermione. Hermione, Sirius. 

- How'd you get away? - Puking Pastilles. It wasn't pretty. 

Told them I was hungry, wanted some sweets. 

They told me to bugger off and ate the lot themselves. 

That was clever, Ron. 

- Has been known to happen. - It was brilliant. 

So how are we getting to London? 

Look, it's not that I don't appreciate everything you've done, all of you... 

...but I've got you into enough trouble as it is. 

Dumbledore's Army's supposed to be about doing something real. 

Or was that all just words to you? 

Maybe you don't have to do this all by yourself, mate. 

So how are we going to get to London? 

We fly, of course. 

Department of Mysteries. 

This is it. 

92,93 Ninety-two. Ninety-three. 

Ninety-four. 

Ninety-five. 

- He should be here. - Harry. 

It's got your name on it. 

The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. 

And the Dark Lord shall mark him as his equal... 

...but he shall have power the Dark Lord knows not. 

For neither can live while the other survives. 

Harry. 

Where's Sirius? 

You know, you really should learn to tell the difference between dreams... 

...and reality. 

You saw only what the Dark Lord wanted you to see. 

Now, hand me the prophecy. 

If you do anything to us, I'll break it. 

He knows how to play. 

Itty, bitty baby. 

Potter. 

Bellatrix Lestrange. 

Neville Longbottom, is it? How's Mum and Dad? 

Better, now they're about to be avenged. 

Now, let's everybody just calm down... 

...shall we? 

All we want is that prophecy. 

Why did Voldemort need me to come and get this? 

You dare speak his name? 

You filthy half-blood! 

It's all right. He's just a curious lad, aren't you? 

Prophecies can only be retrieved by those about whom they are made. 

Which is lucky for you, really. 

Haven't you always wondered... 

...what was the reason for the connection between you and the Dark Lord? 

Why he was unable to kill you... 

...when you were just an infant? 

Don't you want to know the secret of your scar? 

All the answers are there, Potter, in your hand. 

All you have to do... 

...is give it to me. 

Then I can show you everything. 

I've waited 14 years. 

I know. 

I guess I can wait a little longer. Now. Stupefy. 

Stupefy. 

Levicorpus. 

Petrificus Totalus. 

Well done, Neville. 

Stupefy. 

- Stupefy. - Stupefy. 

Stupefy. 

Reducto. 

Get back to the door. 

Department of Mysteries. They got that bit right, didn't they? 

The voices. 

Can you tell what they're saying? 

There aren't any voices, Harry. 

Let's get out of here. 

I hear them too. 

Harry, it's just an empty archway. 

Please, Harry. 

Get behind me. 

Did you actually believe... 

...or were you truly naive enough to think... 

...that children stood a chance against us? 

I'll make this simple for you, Potter. 

Give me the prophecy now... 

...or watch your friends die. 

Don't give it to him, Harry. 

Get away from my godson. 

Now, listen to me. Take the others and get out of here. 

What? No, I'm staying with you. 

You've done beautifully. 

Now, let me take it from here. 

Black. 

Expelliarmus! 

Nice one, James. 

Avada Kedavra. 

No. No. 

I killed Sirius Black. 

- You coming to get me? - Crucio. 

You've got to mean it, Harry. 

She killed him. She deserves it. 

You know the spell, Harry. 

Do it. 

So weak. 

It was foolish of you to come here tonight, Tom. 

The Aurors are on their way. 

By which time I shall be gone, and you... 

...shall be dead. 

You've lost, old man. 

Harry. 

So weak. 

So vulnerable. 

Look at me. 

Harry, it isn't how you are alike. 

It's how you are not. 

Harry? 

You're the weak one... 

...and you'll never know love or friendship. 

And I feel sorry for you. 

You're a fool, Harry Potter. 

And you will lose everything. 

He's back. 

 

 

 

 

 

I know how you feel, Harry. 

No, you don't. 

It's my fault. 

No, the fault is mine. 

I knew it was only a matter of time... 

...before Voldemort made the connection between you. 

I thought by distancing myself from you, as I have done all year... 

...he'd be less tempted, and therefore you might be more protected. 

The prophecy said: 

"Neither one can live while the other one survives." 

It means one of us is gonna have to kill the other, in the end. 

Yes. 

Why didn't you tell me? 

For the same reason you tried to save Sirius. 

The same reason your friends saved you. 

After all these years, after all you've suffered... 

...I didn't want to cause you any more pain. 

I cared too much about you. 

How come you're not at the feast? 

Lost all my possessions. Apparently people have been hiding them. 

That's awful. 

Oh, it's all good fun. 

But as it's the last night, I really do need them back. 

Do you want any help finding them? 

I'm sorry about your godfather, Harry. 

Are you sure you don't want any help looking? 

That's all right. 

Anyway, my mum always said... 

...the things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end. 

If not always in the way we expect. 

Think I'll just go have some pudding. 

I've been thinking about something Dumbledore said to me. 

What's that? 

That even though we've got a fight ahead of us... 

...we've got one thing that Voldemort doesn't have. 

Yeah? 

Something worth fighting for.

DARKNESS.
THUNDER -- or something like it -- sounds in the
distance.
BOOM. Then again. BOOM.
We GLIDE THROUGH the inky blackness. Ambient flashes
illuminate the silhouette of the WB LOGO. We PASS
THROUGH.
INTO more darkness. Lost. More FLASHES. And we --
CUT TO:
A SINGLE EYE
Blank behind glasses. FLASH! The PUPIL CONTRACTS and
we --
CUT TO:
INT. MINISTRY OF MAGIC - ATRIUM - WIDER ANGLE - DAY 1 1
To find... HARRY POTTER, standing numbly beside ALBUS
DUMBLEDORE amidst a MOB of REPORTERS. CAMERAS FLASH.
Dumbledores hand finds his shoulder and Harry is moving,
drifting through the chaos, Dumbledore protective,
graceful, dignified.
CLOSEUP - HARRYS GLASSES
His eyes dart from side to side. The lenses glimmer with
abstraction. We --
DISSOLVE INTO:
EXT. LONDON OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 2 2
... glass, a window, its surface prickling with another
kind of ambient light. We are looking INTO a conference
room where office workers sit around a table. But the
light has caught one workers eye, then another, and soon
they are all rising, stepping to the window, mesmerized
by what lies beyond.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 1.
(CONTINUED)
WORKERS POV - LONDON SKYLINE
Blood-red and stormy. A VORTEX of CLOUDS -- strangely
ominous -- hangs high in the sky, flashing from within,
as if about to rain blood over the city. We --
CUT INTO:
THE STORM
itself and...
... PLUMMET, London expanding, stretching out on all
sides. We SWEEP madly OVER Charing Cross, leaving the
Muggle world behind and SWOOP INTO...
EXT. DIAGON ALLEY - DAY 3 3
... Diagon Alley just as the front window of OLLIVANDERS
WAND SHOP EXPLODES. Witches and wizards flee. In the
drifting smoke, DEATH EATERS appear, accompanied by a
tall, sinewy beast of a man, FENRIR GREYBACK. With a
casual sweep of his hand he sends a wizard flying and a
witch screams. In deep b.g., two Death Eaters abduct a
SHROUDED FIGURE (Ollivander). Greyback grins, then
APPARATES, along with the others...
... leaving Diagon Alley behind. The streets of London
appear below once more, and then the river. Black trails
-- the Death Eaters -- streak across the sky and then
turn TRANSLUCENT as they encircle the MILLENNIUM BRIDGE.
Pedestrians peer upward, bewildered, sensing a shift in
the atmosphere. And then...
The BRIDGE CRUMBLES into the THAMES, the image
horrifyingly beautiful, as is the SOUND of it, a ROAR, a
wail, the last cry of a lion. Then the image begins to
FADE and all goes slowly SILENT, until only a WHISTLING
WIND is heard and...
EXT. MILL TOWN - LATE AFTERNOON 4 4
... tall grasses toss dreamily in a SLANTING RAIN. An *
OLD MILL lists like an ancient ruin against a charcoal
sky. A DARK FIGURE (NARCISSA MALFOY) MATERIALIZES. As
she turns for the town in the distance, another witch
materializes: BELLATRIX LESTRANGE.
BELLATRIX
Narcissa!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 2.
CONTINUED: 2 2
EXT. SPINNERS END - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 5 5
Like a rat in a maze, Narcissa makes her way through a
labyrinth of dilapidated brick houses. Bellatrix trails.
BELLATRIX
Cissy! You mustnt do this. He
cant be trusted.
NARCISSA
The Dark Lord trusts him.
BELLATRIX
The Dark Lord is mistaken.
Narcissa turns, shocked. Bellatrix looks shocked
herself, rain running down her cheeks. *
BELLATRIX
Or so I believe.
NARCISSA
Well, who can one trust these
days?
INT. MILL HOUSE - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON 6 6
Grim and dark, lit by guttering candles. RAIN drums the *
roof eerily. A KNOCKER CLANGS. A SQUAT MAN SHUFFLES *
forth, something familiar in his gait.
EXT. HOUSE (SPINNERS END) - SAME TIME - LATE AFTERNOON 7 7
The door cracks, spilling sallow light onto Narcissa and
Bellatrix. A face: WORMTAIL.
INT. HALLWAY - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS LATER) 8 8
The sisters follow Wormtail down a narrow hallway.
BELLATRIX
He lives in this Muggle dunghill?
Wormtail glowers over his shoulder at her. They pass
into...
INT. MILL HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 9 9
LATER)
... a room where a MAN sits by the window running with *
RAIN, his face hidden by the Daily Prophet. *
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 3.
(CONTINUED)
On the front page is a PHOTOGRAPH of the MILLENNIUM
BRIDGE CRASHING INTO THE THAMES. But even more prominent
is the SILHOUETTE of a YOUNG WIZARD and a HEADLINE:
HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?
Young Wizard Destined to Kill You-Know-Who?
The paper drops and SEVERUS SNAPE eyes the women
curiously.
SNAPE
Run along, Wormtail.
INT. MILL HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (MOMENTS 10 10
LATER)
Snape fills the last of three goblets with wine.
NARCISSA
Ive nowhere else to turn,
Severus.
Snape hands her a goblet, extends one to Bellatrix.
BELLATRIX
You must be joking.
Snape smiles faintly, brings the goblet to his own lips.
NARCISSA
I know I ought not to be here.
The Dark Lord himself has
forbidden me to speak of this --
SNAPE
If the Dark Lord has forbidden it,
you ought not to speak.
(eyes shifting)
Put it down, Bella. We mustnt
touch what isnt ours.
Bellatrix, DARK CURIO in hand, glowers, sets it back
down.
SNAPE
As it so happens Im aware of your
situation, Narcissa.
BELLATRIX
You? The Dark Lord told you?
SNAPE
Your sister doubts me, Narcissa.
Understandable.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 4.
CONTINUED: 9 9
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
Over the years I have played my
part well. So well Ive deceived
one of the greatest wizards of all
time.
Bellatrix makes a scathing sound. Snape turns, eyes
hard.
SNAPE
Dumbledore is a great wizard.
Only a fool would question it.
NARCISSA
I... I dont doubt you, Severus.
BELLATRIX
You should feel honored, Cissy.
As should Draco --
NARCISSA
Hes just a boy!
SNAPE
I cant change the Dark Lords
mind. But it might be possible
for me to help Draco. To provide
some... protection.
Bellatrix eyes Snape keenly.
NARCISSA
Do you mean it, Severus?
SNAPE
I can try.
NARCISSA
Oh, Severus, please, if you
would... (I would be forever in *
your debt.) *
BELLATRIX
Swear to it.
Snapes eyes shift, meet Bellatrixs challenging gaze.
BELLATRIX
Make the Unbreakable Vow.
(as Snape looks away)
You see. Its just empty words.
Oh hell try. Hell give it his
best effort. But when it matters
most hell slither back into his
hole. Bloody coward...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 5.
CONTINUED: 10 10
SNAPE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
Bellatrix goes on MUTTERING as she splashes some wine
into a goblet. Snape turns back, anger flashing in his
eyes.
SNAPE
Take out your wand.
Bellatrix freezes, goblet to her lips. As she lowers it,
a rivulet of red runs out of the corner of her mouth.
NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
Snape faces Narcissa. Bellatrix, hand faintly trembling,
places the tip of her wand over their LINKED hands.
BELLATRIX
Will you, Severus Snape, watch
over Draco Malfoy as he attempts
to fulfill the Dark Lords wishes.
SNAPE
I will.
A SINGLE STRAND of LIQUID FIRE issues from Bellatrixs
wand and wends its way around their hands.
BELLATRIX
And will you, to the best of your
ability, protect him from harm?
SNAPE
I will.
A SECOND STRAND of FIRE intertwines with the first.
BELLATRIX
And should it prove necessary, if
it seems Draco will fail... will
you yourself carry out the deed
that the Dark Lord has ordered
Draco to perform?
Snapes hand TWITCHES within Narcissas. Bellatrix
waits.
SNAPE
I will.
EXT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - NIGHT 11 11
A TRAIN blasts through the station.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 6.
CONTINUED: (2) 10 10
EXT. TREATS FOOD STAND - SAME TIME - NIGHT 12 12
Late. Lonely men and women loiter on the platform. At a
food stand, patrons grimly read their TABLOID of choice.
CAMERA TRACKS PAST The Daily Mail, The Sun, The Mirror --
LANDS ON... the Daily Prophet. The SILHOUETTE. The
HEADLINE: HARRY POTTER: THE CHOSEN ONE?
But the (unseen) reader is fixated on a SMALLER ITEM,
tucked at the bottom corner of the back page: Malfoy
Sentenced to Azkaban. TWO PHOTOGRAPHS accompany the
piece, one of LUCIUS MALFOY, another of Narcissa and
DRACO MALFOY as they exit a courtroom. Dracos eyes look
distant, haunted.
WAITRESS (O.S.)
Harry Potter. Whos Harry Potter?
The paper drops, reveals... Harry. He glances up at the
YOUNG WAITRESS who stands over him. Pretty. Very
pretty.
HARRY
Oh. Um. No one. Bit of a
tosser.
As she leans over to clear his chips wrappings, Harrys
gaze drifts over the smooth skin of her neck, the spray
of freckles across one cheek...
WAITRESS
Funny that paper of yours. Couple
nights ago, I could swear I saw
one of the pictures move.
HARRY
Really.
WAITRESS
Thought Id gone round the twist.
She makes a face, smiles. A smile to die for. Starts to
go.
HARRY
Hey. I was wondering...
WAITRESS
Eleven. Thats when I get off.
(the smile)
You can tell me all about that
tosser Harry Potter.
Harry watches her go, then quickly reaches into his coat
and fumbles out a SMints container. Just then...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 7.
(CONTINUED)
... a LIGHT on the opposite PLATFORM FLICKERS. Harry
looks. It FLICKERS again and this time a small cloud of
GLITTERING DUST dances over the opposite platform. As a
TRAIN ROARS past, Harry squints through the flickering
windows and watches the dust transform into... ALBUS
DUMBLEDORE. Leveling his glasses, he peers across the
platform, smiles and gives Harry a wave.
EXT. OPPOSITE PLATFORM - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 13 13
As Harry arrives, he finds Dumbledore studying a PERFUME
ADVERTISEMENT which shows a MODEL with a WAND in her
teeth: Tonight Make a Little Magic With Your Man.
DUMBLEDORE
I once knew a Muggle girl from
Liverpool with hair like spun
silk. No light could resist it...
(turning)
Youve been reckless this summer,
Harry.
HARRY
I like riding round on the trains.
It takes my mind off... things.
Harry hesitates, notices Dumbledores hand is ASH BLACK.
DUMBLEDORE
Rather unpleasant to behold, isnt
it? The tale is thrilling if I do
say so myself, but Im afraid now
is not the time to tell it. Take
my arm.
(extending it)
Do as I say.
Harry glances across the platform, sees the freckled
Waitress appear, eye his empty table. Slowly, he reaches
out and -- instantly -- all goes BLACK in a RUSH of SOUND
and FURY, as if Harry had been pitched headlong into a
tornado. Seconds later...
EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 14 14
... he re-emerges into the world, reeling, eyes stinging
with tears. Slowly, his planet stops spinning.
HARRY
I just Apparated, didnt I?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 8.

DUMBLEDORE
Indeed. And quite successfully I
might add. Most people vomit
their first time.
HARRY
Cant imagine why...
NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
Dumbledore leads Harry up a steep narrow street lined
with darkened houses.
DUMBLEDORE
Welcome to the charming village of
Budleigh Babberton, Harry. I
assume right about now youre
wondering why Ive brought you
here, am I right?
HARRY
(glancing about)
After all these years, I just sort
of roll with it, sir.
Dumbledore smiles mildly, then pauses, his face
darkening. Before them stands a SMALL STONE HOUSE. But
something is wrong about the place.
DUMBLEDORE
Wand out, Harry.
INT. SLUGHORNS HOUSE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 15 15
THROUGH a crack in the front door: Dumbledore and Harry
move swiftly up the walk and enter.
DUMBLEDORE
Lumos...
The tip of Dumbledores WAND BLAZES. He sweeps the
shadows. CALLS OUT.
DUMBLEDORE
Horace!
Nothing. Dumbledore points his wand down a NARROW
HALLWAY. Motes of dust dance in the wandlight, but
nothing else. He starts down the hallway, toward the
OPEN DOORWAY at its end. Slowly, the room beyond comes
INTO VIEW:
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 9.
CONTINUED: 14 14
INT. SLUGHORNS HOUSE - SITTING ROOM - NIGHT 16 16
Utter devastation. A GRANDFATHER CLOCK lays upon the
floor, its face cracked. A PIANO sags in the corner,
keys strewn like teeth upon the rug. A copy of the Daily
Prophet trembles in the breeze from a half-open window.
As Harry looks, a DROP of something WET strikes the word
CHOSEN. His gaze rises.
He GASPS. A substance DARK and GLUTINOUS is spattered
upon the ceiling. Dumbledore raises his wand. The
ceiling SCREAMS RED. Another drop falls and this one
strikes Harrys SCAR. As Harry moves to wipe it away,
Dumbledore grabs his hand.
Training his light on Harrys forehead, Dumbledore flicks
a blackened finger over the scar. Brings it to his
tongue. Reacts. Turning, his eyes narrow on an
OVERSTUFFED ARMCHAIR. Moving to it, he JABS his wand
into the plump seat cushion.
ARMCHAIR
Merlins Beard!
Instantly, the Armchair mutates into HUMAN FORM, though
briefly gets caught inbetween. After a bit of GRUMBLING,
SEAM-SPLITTING and the POPPING of a cushion button or
two, a FAT OLD MAN (HORACE SLUGHORN) in a pair of WELL-
WORN lilac pajamas appears.
SLUGHORN
(rubbing his rump)
Theres no need to disfigure me,
Albus!
DUMBLEDORE
I must say, you make a very
convincing armchair, Horace.
SLUGHORN
Its all in the upholstery.
(patting his stomach)
I come by the stuffing naturally.
What gave me away?
DUMBLEDORE
(nodding to the
ceiling)
Dragons blood.
SLUGHORN
Yes, well, I couldnt very well
use wizards blood, could I? Oho!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 10.
(CONTINUED)
Slughorn takes a step back, having spotted Harry. The
blood on Harrys forehead only serves to highlight his
scar.
DUMBLEDORE
Ah yes. Introductions. Harry,
this is an old friend and
colleague of mine, Horace
Slughorn. Horace, this is, well,
you know who this is.
(a droll whisper)
Apparently theres some thought he
may be the Chosen One.
Slughorn stares at Harry as if hypnotized.
DUMBLEDORE
So why all the theatrics, Horace?
You werent perhaps expecting
someone else, were you?
SLUGHORN
(blinking)
S-someone else? Im sure I dont
know what you mean.
Dumbledore raises an eyebrow. Slughorn caves.
SLUGHORN
Oh all right! The Death Eaters
have been trying to recruit me for
over a year. Do you know what
thats like? One can only say no
to these people so many times
before they...
DUMBLEDORE
Take matters into their own hands?
Slughorn eyes Dumbledore miserably, gestures.
SLUGHORN
I never stay anywhere more than a
week. The Muggles who own this
place are in the Canary Islands.
DUMBLEDORE
Well, I think it should be put
back in order for them, dont you?
Mind?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 11.
CONTINUED: 16 16
(CONTINUED)
Dumbledore raises his wand. Instantly, the grandfather
clock resumes its rightful place, shattered lanterns re-
ignite and the blood on the ceiling evaporates -- just as
the piano keys tumble back into place with a pleasant
MUSICAL run.
DUMBLEDORE
That was fun. May I use the loo?
As Dumbledore heads down the hall, Slughorn calls after.
SLUGHORN
Dont think I dont know why
youre here, Albus! The answer is
still no! Absolutely,
unequivocally no!
Dumbledore doesnt respond. Slughorn glances at Harry.
The silence is palpable. Awkward. A beat. Then:
SLUGHORN
You look very like your father.
Except for your eyes. Youve
got --
HARRY
My mothers eyes, yeah.
SLUGHORN
(smiling softly)
Lily. Lovely Lily. She was
exceedingly bright -- your mother.
Even more impressive when one
considers she was Muggle-born.
HARRY
One of my best friends is Muggle-
born. Shes the best in our year.
SLUGHORN
Oh, but you mustnt think Im
prejudiced! No, no, no! Your
mother was one of my absolute
favorites! Look, there she is.
Right up front.
Slughorn waves to a dresser crowded with PHOTOGRAPHS.
SLUGHORN
All mine, each and every one. Ex-
students, I mean. You recognize
Barnubas Cuffe, of course, editor
of the Daily Prophet.

Always takes my owl should I want
to register my opinion on the news
of the day. And theres Ambrosius
Flume of Honeydukes. Sends a
hamper of chocolate to the house
each birthday. That is, when I
had a house. And Gwenog Jones,
captain of the Holyhead Harpies --
free tickets whenever I want them.
Of course, I havent been to a
match in some time...
Harry steps forward, takes a picture of one particular
BOY, a boy who resembles... Sirius. Seeing Harry thus
distracted, he studies him intently, like a rare object.
SLUGHORN
Ah yes. Regulus Black. You no
doubt know of his older brother
Sirius. Died a few weeks ago. I
taught the whole Black family
except Sirius. Shame. Talented
boy. I got Regulus when he came
along, of course, but Id have
liked the set.
DUMBLEDORE
Mind if I take this? I do love
knitting patterns.
Slughorn blinks, looks away from Harry and finds
Dumbledore standing there, clutching a MUGGLE MAGAZINE.
SLUGHORN
Of course. But youre not
leaving?
DUMBLEDORE
I think I know a lost cause when I
see one. Regrettable. I would
have considered it a personal
triumph had you consented to
return to Hogwarts, Horace. You
are, like my friend Mr. Potter --
one of a kind.
EXT. SLUGHORNS HOUSE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 17 17
Dumbledore HUMS placidly as he and Harry make their way
down the walk. Seconds later, the front door swings
open.

SLUGHORN
All right! Ill do it. But Ill
be wanting Professor
Merrythoughts old office, not
that water closet I had formerly.
And I expect a raise! These are
mad times we live in! Mad!
DUMBLEDORE
Indeed they are.
EXT. STREET (BUDLEIGH BABBERTON) - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 18 18
Dumbledore leads Harry back toward the Village Square.
HARRY
Sir, exactly what was that all --
DUMBLEDORE
You are talented, famous and
powerful -- everything Horace
values. Professor Slughorn is
going to try to collect you,
Harry. You would be his crowning
jewel. That is why he is
returning to Hogwarts. And it is
crucial he return...
Harry looks intrigued by this last statement, but before
he can pursue it, Dumbledore glances ruefully at the
moon.
DUMBLEDORE
I fear I may have stolen a
wondrous night from you, Harry.
She was, truthfully, very pretty.
The girl.
HARRY
Its alright, sir. Ill go back
tomorrow, make some excuse --
Harry stops. Dumbledore is shaking his head.
DUMBLEDORE
Youll not be going back to Little
Whinging tonight, Harry.
HARRY
But, sir. What about Hedwig? And
theres my trunk --
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 14.

DUMBLEDORE
Both are waiting for you.
Dumbledore extends his arm. Mystified, Harry reaches
out. As his fingers touch the silk of Dumbledores
cloak, he...
EXT. THE BURROW - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 19 19
... APPARATES INTO VIEW, stumbling to one knee and
wincing.
HARRY
Sir?
Dumbledore is gone. Harry rises, glances about. In the
distance a CROOKED HOUSE shimmers. A PRETTY GIRL with
RED HAIR flits briefly past an upstairs window. GINNY
WEASLEY.
INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - STAIRCASE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 20 20
Ginny DASHES down a vertiginous staircase, flies into the
kitchen and finds...
INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS ACTION - NIGHT 21 21
... a LARGE TRUNK and an OWL CAGE. Curious, she cocks
her head to one side. The owl does the same in return.
GINNY
Hedwig...? Mum!
INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - SAME TIME - NIGHT 22 22
GINNYS POV, looking up -- a dizzying perspective of
twisting railings and crooked bedroom doors. A CLOCK
hangs IN VIEW, bearing NINE HANDS, each inscribed with a
Weasley name, each pointing to MORTAL PERIL. MRS.
WEASLEY appears, looks down.
MRS. WEASLEY
What is it, Ginny? Is it your
father? Has something happened at
the Ministry? Has he been
kidnapped? Is it the Death
Eaters?
GINNY
Exactly. Howd you guess?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 15.

Mrs. Weasley throws her hands up over her face.
GINNY
Im joking, Mum.
MRS. WEASLEY
Youre worse than Fred and George.
GINNY
Now youre joking. I was only
wondering when Harry got here.
MRS. WEASLEY
Harry who?
GINNY
Harry Dimpleton. Harry Potter, of
course.
MRS. WEASLEY
I think Id know if Harry Potter
was in my house, wouldnt I?
GINNY
Well his trunks in the kitchen.
And his owl.
MRS. WEASLEY
I seriously doubt that.
Just then, HEDWIG SCREECHES O.S. Ginny gives her an I-
told-you-so when another door opens and RON WEASLEY looks
down.
RON
Harry? Did someone say Harry?
GINNY
Me, nosy. Is he up there with
you?
RON
Course not. Think Id know if my
best friend was in my room,
wouldnt I?
Another door opens: HERMIONE, in a robe, TOOTHBRUSH in
hand.
HERMIONE
Was that an owl I heard?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 16.

GINNY
Harrys. Havent seen him, have

about the house.
HERMIONE
Really?
HARRY (O.S.)
Really.
Ginny spins. Harry. Standing in the doorway of the
kitchen.
RON/HERMIONE/MRS. WEASLEY
Harry!
As the others rocket downstairs, Ginny gives Harry a
great grinning hug. There is something oddly charged in
the moment, a surprise to both of them. The others
arrive. More hugs.
MRS. WEASLEY
But why didnt you tell us you
were coming?
HARRY
Didnt know.
(a shrug) *
Dumbledore.
MRS. WEASLEY
That man. But then, what would we
do without him? Ron!
Ron is about to touch Hermione. She retracts her neck.
RON
Youve a bit of...
He gestures to the stray lace of toothpaste on Hermiones
chin. Quickly she wipes it off, gives him an odd look.
EXT. THE BURROW - ATTIC - NIGHT (LATER) 23 23
The Daily Prophet tumbles within a makeshift campfire of
BLUE FLAMES, but magically doesnt disintegrate. Harry
teases the fire with the tip of his wand, where The
Chosen One? mingles with Dracos haunted face in the
flames.
HARRY
Whend you get here?

HERMIONE
A few days ago. Though... for a
bit, I wasnt sure I was coming.
Harry looks up, sees her glance at Ron.
RON
Mum sort of lost it last week.
Said Ginny and I had no business
going back to Hogwarts. That its
too dangerous.
HARRY
Oh come on...
HERMIONE
Shes not alone. Even my parents
-- and theyre Muggles -- know
something bad is happening.
RON
Anyway, Dad stepped in, told her
she was being barmy. Took a day
or two, but she came round.
HARRY
But were talking about Hogwarts.
Dumbledore. What could be safer?
Hermione and Ron exchange another glance.
HERMIONE
Theres been a lot of chatter
lately. That hes gotten... old.
HARRY
Rubbish. Hes only -- what?
RON
A hundred and fifty. Give or take
a few years.
Silence. Nods. Then the three break out laughing. Grow
quiet again. Harry takes another poke at the Prophet.
Dracos haunted face appears briefly, then is gone.

Its utter madness: Ever-Bashing Boomerangs whip through

fireworks spit sparks, and Nose-Biting Teacups bare tiny
porcelain teeth. FRED & GEORGE WEASLEY, in SCREAMING
MAGENTA, stand upon a counter, selling to the masses:
FRED/GEORGE
Step up! Step up!
GEORGE
Weve got Fainting Fancy...
FRED
Nosebleed Nougats...
GEORGE
And just in time for school...
FRED
Puking Pastilles!
A BOY stops chewing, turns PALE GREEN -- literally.
FRED/GEORGE
Into the cauldron, handsome.
Together, with the tips of their toes, Fred and George
launch a SLOSHING CAULDRON down the counter, drop down on
either side of Harry, begin to steer him through the
store.
FRED
Whatd you think, Harry?
HARRY
Amazing.
GEORGE
(to a browsing boy)
Pocket that and youll pay in more
than Galleons, my friend.
FRED/GEORGE
Weve got eyes in the back of our
heads.
The boy, working a SCREAMING YO-YO, blanches as Fred and
George turn, reveal they do in fact have EYES IN THE BACK
OF THEIR HEADS -- phony, but unnerving. As the EYES
WINK, the tiny boy bolts.

Love Potions.
GEORGE
Yes, they do really work.

Cant breed them fast enough.
Just then a HUGE BOY (CORMAC McLAGGEN) passes behind
Hermione and, with his eyes, takes the full measure of
her. Noticing, she turns, receives a faint smile as he
moves on.

The sun fades over an IRON ARCHWAY -- Welcome to Diagon
Alley! -- as Harry, Ron and Hermione pass beneath. All
around them, SHOPS sit silent, windows BOARDED-UP or
SHATTERED. People scurry by, avoiding the SCARY FACES of
the witches and wizards who peer out from the SECURITY
POSTERS plastered to every LAMP POST. Bellatrix is
there: KNOWN DEATH EATER, And Greyback: WEREWOLF.
And LUCIUS MALFOY: CAUGHT.
HERMIONE
How is it Fred and George are
doing it? Half the alleys closed
down.
RON
Fred reckons people need a laugh
these days.
HARRY
Reckon hes right...
Harry eyes the poster of Bellatrix, her mocking half-
smile.
HERMIONE
Oh no. Look.
Harry and Ron follow her gaze to the wreck that is
Ollivanders Wand Shop.
HERMIONE
But everyone got their wands from
Ollivander. Young. Old...
HARRY
Good. Bad. Speaking of which...
Across the avenue, DRACO MALFOY and Narcissa pause,
glance around, then slip quickly down an alley.
RON
Is it just me? Or do Draco and
mummy look like two people who
dont want to be followed?
EXT. VARIOUS STREETS - DIAGON ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON 26 26
The trio trail Draco and Narcissa, who navigate these
dark streets with ease. Hermione, lagging a bit, glances
up at the darkening sky. When she looks back, she sees
Ron and Harry far ahead. They turn a shadowy corner,
vanish.

NEW ANGLE - SHOP FRONT - MOMENTS LATER
Harry and Ron duck inside a shop front. At the end of
the alley, a single shop glimmers dully: Borgin &
Burkes. Narcissa and Draco enter, greet a STOOPED MAN
(BORGIN). He POINTS. Draco walks to a LACQUERED
CABINET, plays his fingers over its glassy surface.
Narcissa speaks and Draco turns, finds Borgin holding the
curtain to the back room aside. Draco hesitates, then
follows his mother through.
RON
Whatre they playing at?
HARRY
Dunno. Lets get closer.
RON

Hey. Wheres Hermione?
NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER ALLEY - DUSK
Hermione moves through the shadows, alone, peering down
side streets, each darker than the next, lost, but
holding it together, when... a SHADOW FLICKERS overhead.
She looks up, sees a FIGURE (Greyback) leap from one roof
to another. She stands perfectly still, then... hears
VOICES.

Harry and Ron race down one passage then another. Stop.
RON
Harry, where is she?

I dont know. Im turned around.

Hermione creeps to the end of a narrow passage, toward
the VOICES, and finds herself... behind Borgin & Burkes.
FIGURES encircle an old cauldron, among them Greyback,
Bellatrix, Narcissa, and in the very center... Draco.
Hermione squints against the brilliance of the FIRE, the
FIGURES twisting like Giacomettis. Draco extends his
left arm... when a SHADOW falls over Hermione, fingers
find her arm. She wheels, terrified.

A blood-red sun shimmers through the windows, staining
the interior a deep scarlet. Students read, play cards.
In one compartment, CRABBE and GOYLE slumber sloppily.
As Harry enters, the ACCORDION doors to the NEXT CAR
SQUALL open and a PAIR of TWIN GIRLS emerge. He watches
them when a VOICE causes him to turn back. As the
accordion doors slowly close, he spies Malfoy sitting
with PANSY PARKINSON and a BOY with the cheekbones of a
sphinx (BLAISE ZABINI).
Harry studies Malfoy when a BOY pushes through the
accordion doors. As they begin to close, slowly, Harry
reaches into his pocket and removes the ORANGE AND BLACK
LUMP Fred gave him in Diagon Alley. He eyes Malfoy, eyes
the closing door and -- impulsively -- pitches the lump
into the air. It soars through the narrowing crease of
the doors and -- just as Malfoy glances his way -- just
as it reaches the apex of its flight -- POOF! -- explodes
softly, raining DARK POWDER.

darkness eerily recedes, the red light of dusk returns
and Malfoy is revealed, standing in the DOORWAY of the
car. As he looks on warily, students return to their
seats. Across the way, Crabbe & Goyle continue to
slumber.
MALFOY
What just happened? Blaise?
BLAISE
(tense himself)
Dont know.
Just then, a SMALL BAG TEETERS... then tumbles from a
luggage rack. Malfoy wheels, eyes the bag.

PANSY
Relax, boys. The lights went out
is all. Come, Draco. Well be *
at Hogwarts before you know it. *
She pats the seat. Draco eyes the bag, slings it back
onto the luggage rack and plops down. Pansy strokes his
hair.
MALFOY
Hogwarts. What a pathetic excuse
for a school. I think Id pitch
myself off the Astronomy Tower if
I thought I had to continue on for
another two years.
Pansy, gently twisting one of Dracos locks, stops.
PANSY
Whats that supposed to mean?
MALFOY
Lets just say I dont think
youll be seeing me wasting my
time in Charms Class next year.
Confused, Pansy glances at Blaise, who snorts derisively.
MALFOY
Amused, Blaise? Well see just
whos laughing in the end.
Blaise shakes his head, smiling as he looks out the
window at the darkness. Just then the small bag in the
upper rack shifts. Malfoys eyes play over it.
EXT. STATION - DUSK/EVENING 33 33
The Hogwarts Express steams into the station.

Ron and Hermione step into the crowded aisle.

RON
Probably on the platform. Cmon.

INT. COMPARTMENT - DUSK/EVENING 35 35
As Blaise and Pansy make to exit, Malfoy takes down the
small bag, grips the handle thoughtfully.
MALFOY
You two go on. I want to check
something.
Malfoy slides shut the door. LETS THE BLINDS DOWN. A
beat.
MALFOY
Didnt mummy ever tell you its
bad manners to eavesdrop, Potter?
Petrificus Totalus!
Malfoy wheels, points his wand at the luggage rack.
Something hits the floor with a THUMP. The Invisibility
Cloak slips away and reveals Harry, paralyzed on the
floor. Malfoy grins.
MALFOY
Oh, right, she was dead before you
could wipe the drool off your
chin.
Malfoy brings his boot down hard on Harrys face. SNAP!
Blood squirts from Harrys nose. Malfoy snatches up the
Invisibility Cloak, pitches it over Harry.
MALFOY
Enjoy the ride back to London.
EXT. STATION - EVENING (MOMENTS LATER) 36 36
Malfoy steps off, pulls his cloak tight and disappears
into the night. Softly, a SOUND rises, of a GIRL LIGHTLY
HUMMING and we --
CUT TO:
INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - AISLE - EVENING 37 37
... STRANGE MOVING POV - HALF RED/HALF BLUE
Luna Lovegood wanders down the aisle HUMMING, red and
blue Spectrespecs wobbling on the bridge of her nose. Up
ahead one compartments BLINDS are shut. Luna stops
HUMMING. Cocks her head curiously. As she does, the
LIGHT from an overhead lantern kicks off the cheap
plastic lenses of her glasses and, for the briefest of
seconds, a FLUTTERING CLOUD appears.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 27.

Of tiny insects. Or pixie dust. Or a trick of the
light.
INT. COMPARTMENT - SAME TIME - EVENING 38 38
Lunas SILHOUETTE SWELLS over the blinds, then the door
opens. She calmly draws her wand and sends forth a blast
of RED LIGHT. The Invisibility Cloak slithers from
Harrys body.
LUNA
Hello, Harry.
HARRY
Luna. Howd you...?
LUNA
Wrackspurts. Your heads full of
them.
EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT (LATER) 39 39
The castle glitters. Harry, face blood-spattered, nose
slightly off-center, approaches with Luna.
HARRY
Sorry I made you miss the
carriages, Luna.
LUNA
Its alright. I enjoyed our walk.
It was like being with a friend.
HARRY
I am your friend, Luna.
LUNA
Thats nice.
Just then PROFESSOR FLITWICK rushes forth clutching a
long roll of PARCHMENT bearing all students names.
FLITWICK
About time! Ive been looking all
over for you two. Names.
HARRY
Professor Flitwick, youve known
me for five years.
FLITWICK
No exceptions, Potter.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 28.

LUNA
Who are those people?
Harry turns, sees Luna staring into the darkness, where
SHADOWS drift eerily, like ghosts.
FLITWICK
Aurors. For security.
MALFOY (O.S.)
Its a not a cane, you cretin.
Its a walking stick.
Harry and Luna turn. Draco stands amidst a mountain of
TRUNKS and OWL CAGES, watching Filch pass a long SECURITY
DETECTOR over a WALKING STICK.
FILCH
And what exactly would you be
wanting with a walking stick?
SNAPE
It was his fathers.
Snape separates from the shadows. Draco eyes him warily,
then snatches the stick from Filch.
MALFOY
Is my fathers. Hes not dead.
Snape watches Malfoy carefully wrap the stick in felt,
lay it back inside his trunk.
SNAPE
Its alright, Mr. Filch. I can
vouch for Mr. Malfoy.
Draco eyes Snape warily again, then begins to slouch off,
catches Harry looking.
MALFOY
Nice face, Potter.
Harry puts a hand to his nose, watches Malfoy disappear
into the darkness, trailed by Snape.
LUNA
Would you like me to fix it?
Personally I think you look a bit
more devil-may-care this way. But
its up to you.
HARRY
Have you ever fixed one? A nose.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 29.

LUNA
No. But Ive done several toes
and how different are they really?
This does not fill Harry with confidence.
Nevertheless...
HARRY
What the hell. Give it a go.

LUNA
Episkey.
Luna poises her wand over Harrys nose and... gives it a
TAP. It VIBRATES WILDLY and then... SNAPS into place.
HARRY
Well? How do I look?
LUNA
Exceptionally ordinary.
HARRY
Brilliant.
INT. GREAT HALL - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 40 40
Hermione cranes her neck, looking for Harry, while Ron
stuffs his face with pudding, MUMBLING, MOUTH FULL:
RON
Don you worry. Hell be long
soon nuff --
HERMIONE
(whacking him)
Will. You. Stop. Eating! Your
best friend is missing!
RON
Oi! Turn around, you lunatic.
Hermione spins, sees Harry and Luna approaching. In the
light of the hall, Harrys blood-spattered face is quite
the sight.
GINNY
Hes covered in blood again. Why
is it hes always covered in
blood?
RON
Looks like his own this time.
HERMIONE
(as he arrives)
Whereve you been, Harry? And
what happened to your face?
HARRY
Later. Whatve I missed?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 30.

RON
(shrugging; still
eating)
Sorting Hat urged us all to be
brave and strong in these troubled
times -- easy for it to say --
its a hat, isnt it? First Years
seemed to enjoy it, though.
Wankers. Filch give you the wand
outside?
Harry nods. Ginny, damp napkin in hand, begins to dab
his face, then feels suddenly awkward. Harry takes it
from her.
HARRY
Thanks...
Just then, the light in the Hall begins to gently dim and
all eyes turn to Dumbledore, standing at the top of the
Hall, ashen hand raised to the enchanted ceiling, where
clouds respond to his gestures and shroud a gleaming full
moon.
HERMIONE
Whats happened to his hand?
DUMBLEDORE
The very best of evenings to you!
First off, please join me in
welcoming the newest member of our
staff, Horace Slughorn.
MILD APPLAUSE ensues. Harry claps perfunctorily, his
eyes drifting to the entrance of the Hall as a pair of
Aurors station themselves just outside.
DUMBLEDORE
Professor Slughorn, Im happy to
say, has agreed to resume his old
post of Potions master. Meanwhile
the post of Defense Against the
Dark Arts will be assumed by
Professor Snape.
This is greeted by stunned silence. Dumbledore frowns,
then attempts to generate something by CLAPPING his hands
once. A few Slytherins join in and some dim-witted First
Years.
DUMBLEDORE
Now, as you know, each and every
one of you was searched upon your
arrival tonight. You have a right
to know why.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 31.

Once there was a young man who,
like you, sat in this very Hall.
Walked this castles corridors.
Slept beneath its roof. He
seemed, to all the world, a
student like any other. His name?
Tom Riddle.
The Hall goes utterly silent.
DUMBLEDORE
Today, of course, the world knows
him by another name. Which is
why, as I stand looking out upon
you all tonight, I am reminded of
a sobering fact. Each day, every
hour, this very minute perhaps,
dark forces attempt to penetrate
this castle. But in the end,
their greatest weapon remains...
you.
Harry eyes Malfoy, slouched low, lazily levitating a fork
with his wand, as if Dumbledore were unworthy of
attention.
DUMBLEDORE
Just something to keep in mind.
Now, off to bed. Pip pip!
RON
(as they rise)
That was cheerful.
INT. CORRIDOR - MORNING 41 41
A TEEMING MASS of STUDENTS fight their way to class on
first day of term. Amidst it all, McGonagall stands tall
and stern. The twins pass by, bearing identical looks of
consternation.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
History of Magic is up, ladies,
not down. Mr. Davies -- thats
the girls toilet...
McGonagalls eyes shift, find Harry and Ron sitting upon
a ledge, clearly deriving immense pleasure from the
chaos.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL

Harrys smile droops. McGonagall beckons with a finger.
HARRY
This cant be good.
Ron grins as Harry makes his way upstream to
McGonagall.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Enjoying ourself, are we?
HARRY
Well, you see, Ive got an open
period this morning, Professor --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
So I noticed. I would think youd
want to fill it with Potions. Or
is it no longer your ambition to
become an Auror?
HARRY
It is. Or was. But I was told I
had to get an Outstanding in my
O.W.L. --
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
And so you did when Professor
Snape was teaching Potions.
However, Professor Slughorn is
perfectly happy to accept N.E.W.T.
students with Exceeds
Expectations.
HARRY
Really? Well... brilliant. Ill
head there straight away.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Good. And take Weasley with you.
He looks far too happy over there.
INT. CORRIDOR/SLUGHORNS CLASSROOM - MORNING (MOMENTS 42 42

Ron trails Harry toward an open door. *

INT. SLUGHORNS CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION - MORNING 43 43
As Harry drags Ron inside, the other students turn in
unison. Hermione frowns. Lavender, seeing Ron, beams.
SLUGHORN
Harry mboy! I was beginning to
worry! And I see weve brought
someone with us...
RON
Ron Weasley, sir. But Im dead
awful at Potions, a menace
actually, so I probably should
just be going --
SLUGHORN
Nonsense, well sort you out. Any
friend of Harrys is a friend of
mine. Right then, books out --
HARRY
Um, sorry, sir, but I havent got
my book yet -- nors Ron. You
see -- (until this morning...) *
SLUGHORN
Not to worry. You can get what
you need from the cupboard.
As Harry and Ron step to the cupboard, Slughorn resumes,
gesturing to the cauldrons bubbling before him.
SLUGHORN
Now, as I was saying, Ive
prepared a few concoctions this
morning. Any ideas what these
might be? Yes, Miss...?
HERMIONE
Granger, sir. That one there is
Veritaserum. And that would be
Polyjuice Potion. And that...
In the cupboard, Harry and Ron find two TEXTBOOKS -- one
new, one shabby and soiled. Both snatch for the new when
a box -- marked BEZOARS -- tips. As Harry makes a grab
for it, Ron wrests free the new textbook and goes off
grinning.
HERMIONE
... is Amortentia! The most
powerful love potion in the world.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 34.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
Its rumored to smell differently
to each person, according to what
attracts them. For example, I
smell freshly mown grass and
new parchment and spearmint
toothpaste --
Hermione blushes, stops herself. Slughorn regards her.
SLUGHORN
One of my best friends is Muggle-
born. Shes the best in our
year...
Harry, settling into his seat with the soiled textbook,
looks up just as Slughorns eyes shift to him for
confirmation. As Harry nods, Hermione glances curiously
at him.
SLUGHORN
Now Amortentia doesnt create
actual love, of course. Thats
impossible. But it does cause a
powerful infatuation or obsession.
For that reason, it is probably
the most dangerous potion in this
room.
Slughorn turns, finds a sea of dreamy faces leaning into
the VAPORS. Instantly, he CLANGS a cover onto the
cauldron, bringing them round. As Ron blinks, he finds
Lavender still staring dreamily -- at him. Noticing,
Hermiones eyes narrow.
KATIE BELL
Sir, you havent told us whats in
that one.
SLUGHORN
Ah yes...
Slughorn steps to a SMALL BLACK CAULDRON. Begins to
ladle a bit of GOLDEN LIQUID into a TINY VIAL.
SLUGHORN
What you see before you, ladies
and gentlemen, is a curious little
potion known as Felix Felicis.
But it is more commonly referred
to as --
HERMIONE
Liquid luck.
A buzz runs through the class. Even Malfoy perks up.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 35.
CONTINUED: 43 43
HERMIONE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
SLUGHORN
Yes, Miss Granger. Desperately
tricky to make. Disastrous should
you get it wrong. But brewed
correctly, as this has been, it
has remarkable powers. One sip
and you will find that all your
endeavors succeed... at least
until the effects wear off.
KATIE BELL
But then why dont people drink it
all the time?
SLUGHORN
Because taken in excess it causes
giddiness, recklessness and
dangerous overconfidence.
BLAISE
Have you ever taken it, sir?
SLUGHORN
Twice. Once when I was twenty-
four. Once when I was fifty-
seven. Two tablespoons taken at
breakfast. Two perfect days...
Slughorn eyes the vial dreamily, adrift. Finally he
blinks.
SLUGHORN
So. This is what I offer each of
you today. One tiny vial of
liquid luck... to the student who,
in the hour that remains, manages
to brew an acceptable Draught of
Living Death, the recipe for which
can be found on page ten of your
textbook.
Excitement seizes the class. Slughorn smiles knowingly.
SLUGHORN
You should know that in all the
years of my previous tenure at
Hogwarts, not once did a student
brew a potion of sufficient
quality to claim this prize. In
any event -- good luck.
Slughorn sets the vial upon his desk, where it SHIMMERS
in a SHAFT of SUNLIGHT. Harry opens his book. Frowns.
The MARGINS of the page before him are black with the
tight SCRIBBLINGS of a previous owner.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 36.

(CONTINUED)
The same CREEPY GRAFFITI fills the next page as well, on
and on throughout the book. Shaking his head, Harry runs
his finger under the first PRINTED INSTRUCTION:
Cut up one Sopophorous bean.
Harry takes the SILVER DAGGER upon his desk, poises it
over the BEAN when... Rons bean shoots across the room
and bounces off Katie Bells head. Harry surveys the
rest of the room: everyone is struggling to cut the
resistant legume. He glances back to his book, considers
the instruction again.
As ARROW has been drawn from the word Cut to the
margin, where a modification has been written in the
tight scrawl:
Crush with blade -- releases juice better.
Harry considers the dagger in his hand, then places the
flat of the blade against the bean and presses.
Instantly, the protective parchment covering the desk
runs RED with juice.
HERMIONE
How did you do that?
HARRY
Crush it. Dont cut it.
HERMIONE
No. The instructions specifically
say to cut.
HARRY
No. Really --
HERMIONE
Sh!
Harry shrugs, lifts the parchment and tips the juice into
his cauldron. It HISSES, then turns LILAC. Harry grins.
CAMERA BEGINS SLOW DOLLY TOWARDS the vial of Felix
Felicis and...
MONTAGE BEGINS
Students struggle. A cauldron overflows. Lavender eyes
Ron.
CAMERA CREEPS TOWARD VIAL. THE SUNLIGHT SHIFTS.
Hermione grows more and more frustrated. Her hair grows
bushier in the steam rising from her cauldron...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 37.

Harrys finger traces under the official instruction...
then drifts to the spidery scrawl in the margin...
Malfoy cuts himself, curses...
CAMERA CREEPS CLOSER TO VIAL. SUNLIGHT SHIFTS AGAIN.
Harry, cool as a cucumber, adds one last ingredient,
steps back, done...
Hermione, hair like Medea now, glowers at him...
THE LIGHT SHIFTS ONE LAST TIME. THE VIAL GLIMMERS LIKE
GOLD.
MONTAGE ENDS.
ANOTHER ANGLE
Slughorn wends his way amongst the cauldrons, nodding
with sympathy at the fiascos before him. Then... he
stops, staring in disbelief at the pearly sheen of one
bubbling potion.
SLUGHORN
Merlins Beard! But its perfect.
So perfect I daresay one sip would
kill us all! Your mother was a
dab hand at potions, but this...
My, my, what cant you do, mboy?
Perhaps you will save us all in
the end...
All eyes turn to Harry. His smile falters.
SLUGHORN
Here you are then, as promised.
One bottle of Felix Felicis. Use
it well.
Slowly, Harry reaches out... takes the glittering vial.
EXT. CASTLE - NIGHT 44 44
The Castle is dark, but for one WINDOW.
INT. DUMBLEDORES OFFICE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 45 45
Dumbledore sits alone at his desk, the deep lines of his
face illuminated by the shimmering PENSIEVE. TWO OBJECTS
of note are before him. One is a BLACK-STONED RING. The
other is TOM RIDDLES DIARY.

He briefly balances the ring upon the tip of an ashen
finger, then turns a page of the battered diary. His
face is troubled. A KNOCK. He takes the ring and diary,
slips them inside a drawer. The door swings open,
reveals Harry.
DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Harry. You got my
message, I see. Come, come. Sit.
Harry steps forward, eyes the Pensieve curiously. Sits.
DUMBLEDORE
So. How are you?
HARRY
Fine, sir.
DUMBLEDORE
Enjoying your classes? Professor
Slughorn, for one, is most
impressed with you.
HARRY
I think he overestimates my
abilities, sir.
DUMBLEDORE
Do you?
HARRY
Definitely.
Dumbledore smiles affectionately, nods.
DUMBLEDORE
And what of your activities
outside the classroom? Do they
bring you satisfaction?
HARRY
Sir?
DUMBLEDORE
I notice you spend a great deal of

help but wonder if --
HARRY
No! I mean... shes brilliant.

Dumbledore smiles faintly, shakes his head.
DUMBLEDORE

In any event, Im sure youre
wondering why Ive summoned you
here tonight. The answer lies
here.
Dumbledore swings open a cabinet where DOZENS upon DOZENS
of GLITTERING VIALS stand like tiny glimmering soldiers.
DUMBLEDORE
What you see before you are
memories. In this case pertaining
to one individual: Voldemort. Or
as he was known then... Tom
Riddle.
Dumbledore reaches down with his damaged hand and removes
a stoppered VIAL, dusty and veined with age.
DUMBLEDORE
This vial contains a most
particular memory -- of the day I
first met him. Id like you to
see it. If you would...
Dumbledore extends his ashen hand and Harry rises,
gingerly takes the vial and removes the cork. He tips
the contents into the Pensieve. Dumbledore nods and
Harry leans into the iridescent liquid, his face breaking
the surface...
FLASHBACK - EXT. STREET (LONDON) - DAY (YEARS PAST) 46 46
A horse-drawn MILK CART rattles across a RAIN-SWEPT *
London street and a YOUNG DUMBLEDORE appears in a PLUM

A skinny, sharp-featured woman, MRS. COLE, leads
Dumbledore down a drab corridor. CHILDRENS VOICES carry
from an unseen COURTYARD, splashing and shrieking, in the *
midst of some game.
MRS. COLE
I must confess to a bit of
confusion upon receiving your
letter, Mr. Dumbledore. In all
the years Toms been here, hes
never once had a family visitor.
Frankly, I was stunned to find
that someone knew of his
existence.
DUMBLEDORE
I am not family. But his name has
been known to me since birth.
MRS. COLE
I see...
But she doesnt really. She stops, frowns.
MRS. COLE
I think I should tell you. Hes a
funny boy -- Tom. Odd. There
have been incidents with the other
children. Nasty things.
DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps you could give me an
example.
Mrs. Cole starts to speak, then shakes her head, moves
off. As Dumbledore makes to follow, his eyes happen upon
a FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH on the wall, old and yellowing,
depicting a SEASIDE SCENE of a SHARP ROCK OUTCROPPING and
a CAVE. As he exits, we HOLD ON it.

DUMBLEDORE
How do you do, Tom.
Riddle eyes Dumbledore briefly, looks away.
MRS. COLE
Well, Ill leave you two to
yourselves.
Mrs. Cole exits, closing the door. Dumbledore studies
Riddle, then begins to tour the room. Carefully placed
upon a low shelf are some ODD SOUVENIRS. A grouping of
SEVEN STONES... A book containing SEVEN MATCHES. SEVEN
BRASS KEYS...
Moving on, Dumbledore passes a TALL CABINET, tracing his
FINGERS over its surface, as if the woods grain were
Braille, as if somehow seeing what lies within.
Then Dumbledore pauses. Strewn on a small table are a
grouping of SEVEN DARK DRAWINGS. A BOY and GIRL, their
faces anguished. A sea-swept CAVE. The same cave from
the photograph. Dumbledore begins to reach out...
TOM RIDDLE
Dont.
Dumbledore stops, turns. Finds Riddles level gaze on
him.
DUMBLEDORE
As you wish.
Riddle looks away and Dumbledore, for the first time,
notices his hands. They are splayed, utterly still, and
INTERLACED with a SILKY WEB, where a SPIDER knits back
and forth.
TOM RIDDLE
Youre the doctor, arent you?
DUMBLEDORE
No. I am a Professor.
TOM RIDDLE
I dont believe you. I hear Mrs.
Cole talking, her and the rest of

DUMBLEDORE
Its a school. A school of...
magic.
Riddle stays looking, but says nothing.
DUMBLEDORE
You can do things, cant you, Tom?
Things the other children cant.
Riddle eyes Dumbledore intensely, unblinking.
TOM RIDDLE
Yes.
DUMBLEDORE
Tell me some of the things you can
do, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE
(watching the spider)
I can make things move -- without
touching them. I can make animals
do what I want without training
them. I can make bad things
happen to people who are mean to
me. I can make them hurt... if I
want.
Dumbledore studies Riddle -- then the boy looks up.
TOM RIDDLE
Who are you?
DUMBLEDORE
Im like you, Tom. Different.
Riddle closes his hands and the web collapses.
TOM RIDDLE
Prove it.
It is not a request. Without breaking his gaze,
Dumbledores eyes narrow ever-so-slightly and... the
WARDROBE BURSTS INTO FLAMES. Riddle wheels.

I think there is something trying

Open it. Open. It.
Terrified, Riddle steps to the burning wardrobe and
throws open the door. On the topmost shelf, above a rail
of threadbare clothes, a SMALL BOX SHAKES VIOLENTLY.
DUMBLEDORE
Take it out.
As Riddles fingers touch the box, the flames engulfing
the wardrobe vanish, but the box continues to SHAKE --
the only sound in the now-silent room.
DUMBLEDORE
Is there anything in that box you
ought not to have?
Riddle eyes Dumbledore, a trifle fearfully this time. He
spills the box onto the bed: a YO-YO, a silver THIMBLE,
and a tarnished MOUTH ORGAN.
DUMBLEDORE
Why did you want these things,
Tom?
TOM RIDDLE
(looking off)
I like having things that belonged
to other people. It makes me feel
... close to them.
Dumbledore studies Riddles profile, pondering this.
DUMBLEDORE
Thievery is not tolerated at
Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, you will
be taught not only how to use
magic, but to control it.
Understood?
(as Riddle nods)
Ill be going now, Tom. Leave
your window open tonight. An owl
will bring you a message. Read it
carefully.
Dumbledore starts to exit, when:
TOM RIDDLE
I can speak to snakes too.
Dumbledore stops and we are ON his face, his back to
Riddle.

(CONTINUED)
TOM RIDDLE
They find me. Whisper things. Is
that normal. For someone like me?
DUMBLEDORE
It is unusual. But not unheard
of.
Dumbledore exits then, without a backward glance, leaving
11-year-old Tom Riddle alone. The IMAGE SHUDDERS and...
INT. DUMBLEDORES OFFICE - NIGHT (PRESENT) 49 49
... Harry and Dumbledore reappear. The room has grown
DIM in their absence. Dumbledore gestures. LAMPS BLAZE
to LIFE.
HARRY
Did you know, sir? Then?
DUMBLEDORE
Did I know that I had just met the
most dangerous Dark Wizard of all
time? No. Had I...
Dumbledore falters, his expression troubled. Harry looks
up from the Pensieve, where young Tom Riddles fragmented
face floats on the surface, eyes Dumbledore.
DUMBLEDORE
Over time, while here at Hogwarts,
Tom Riddle grew close to one
particular teacher. Can you guess
which teacher that might be?
HARRY
You didnt bring Professor
Slughorn back simply to teach
Potions, did you, sir?
DUMBLEDORE
No. I did not. You see,
Professor Slughorn possesses
something I desire very dearly.
And he will not part with it
easily...
(eyeing Harry
knowingly)
Id rather not divulge any more
just yet, Harry. But I promise.
In time you will know everything.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 45.
CONTINUED: (6) 48 48
(CONTINUED)
HARRY
You said Professor Slughorn would
try to collect me.
DUMBLEDORE
I did.
HARRY
Do you want me to let him?
Dumbledore trails his ashen fingers in the surface of the
Pensieve, vanquishing young Tom Riddles face.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes.
EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH - MORNING 50 50
Harry tries -- with little success -- to get the
attention of the throng of aspiring Quidditch players
assembled on the pitch.
HARRY
All right! Queue up! Excuse
me...
GINNY
SHUT IT!
Instant silence. Harry frowns, nods to Ginny
nevertheless.
HARRY
Thanks. All right. This morning
Ill be putting you all through a
few drills to assess your
strengths. But know this: Just
because you made the team last
year does not guarantee you a spot
this year. Is that clear?
Ron looks unnerved at this, sweating so much hes
attracted a PESKY FLY. CORMAC McLAGGEN, the huge boy
from Weasleys Wizard Wheezes, sidles up.
CORMAC
No hard feelings, Weasley,
alright?
RON
Hard feelings?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 46.
CONTINUED: 49 49
(CONTINUED)
CORMAC
Ill be going out for Keeper as
well. Nothing personal.
RON
Really? Strapping guy like you,
youve got a Beaters build, dont
you think? Keeper needs to be
agile, quick --
Cormac nabs the FLY between two fingers, kills the BUZZ.
CORMAC
I like my chances. Say... think
you could introduce me to your
friend Granger? Wouldnt mind
getting on a first name basis,
know what I mean?
Cormac gives a lewd wink, saunters off. Ron glances up
to the stands. Hermione smiles, waves.
BEGIN MONTAGE
Ginny flies swiftly, handling the Quaffle with ease.
TWO SECOND YEARS collide in mid-air.
Cormac makes a brilliant save.
Ron makes a shaky save.
Hermione looks on, nervous for him.
Katie Bell snatches a Quaffle with one hand, splits two
defenders beautifully and makes a slick blind pass to
Dean who jets high in the air, then lets the Quaffle roll
off his fingers... right into Ginnys hands as she races
below.
Seamus sends a Bludger rocketing into the stands,
scatters a group of onlookers, leaving only Neville, who
sidles delicately to the right as the others leg it.
TWO THIRD YEARS collide in mid-air.
Cormac makes a brilliant save.
Ron turns the wrong way but makes the save anyway as the
Quaffle caroms off the tail of his broom.
Hermione looks on more nervously.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 47.

DEMELZA ROBINS, bent low over her stick, pins the Quaffle
under her chin, splits two Bludgers and a pair of
Beaters.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 47A.
CONTINUED: (2) 50 50
(CONTINUED)
TWO FOURTH YEARS collide in mid-air.
Two aspiring Beaters whiff on a pair of Bludgers, whack
each other instead and plummet to the pitch as the
Bludgers ricochet off one another and go flying into the
stands, scattering onlookers yet again and leaving, as
before, only Neville. This time, he sidles delicately to
the left.
Cormac makes a brilliant save.
The Quaffle bounces off Rons head.
Hermione looks on extremely nervously.
TWO FIFTH YEARS collide in mid-air.
END MONTAGE.
ANOTHER ANGLE
The survivors press ICE PACKS to their heads, run TAPE
round twisted fingers. Only Ron, hovering at the west
goal, and Cormac, hovering at the east, remain on the
pitch. Luna, Spectrespecs in place, eyes Cormac -- cool,
confident, clear. Then eyes Ron -- sweaty, nervous,
SWARMING in WRACKSPURTS.
HARRY
All right. Cormac. Ron. Its
down to you two for Keeper. Well
decide it with a shootout.
Demelza, youll bring the Quaffle
up against Cormac. Ginny, youll
take on Ron.
CORMAC
Hang on. Shes his sister. How
do I know she wont toss him a
floater?
GINNY
Piss off, Cormac. How bout I
toss you a floater?
HARRY
Quiet! Im Captain. We do it my
way. Now line up. On three.
One. Two... Three!
Demelza and Ginny rocket forth. Ron weaves nervously
while Cormac hovers in place, a confident sneer on his
face.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 48.
CONTINUED: (3) 50 50
(CONTINUED)
HARRY
(under his breath)
Cmon, Ron...
Demelza hunkers over her broom once again, flying like an
arrow, then goes into a wide, sweeping slide. Ginny
blasts over the pitch, ginger hair streaming like flames,
then rolls recklessly to the side. As one, they both let
fly...
Hermione, face buried in her fingers, MUTTERS SOMETHING.
Cormac, at the last moment, inexplicably rolls his broom
to the right and the Quaffle sails over his shoulder.
Ron, zig-zagging crazily, nearly falls off, rights
himself in a panic, and deflects Ginnys Quaffle... with
his forehead. As a few partisan CHEERS erupt from the
stands, Harry grins, then has to restrain himself.
Hermione opens her eyes slowly.
LAVENDER BROWN
Isnt he brilliant?
Hermione stares balefully at Lavender, then notices
Cormac eyeing his broom incredulously. She gets up,
slips away.
INT. COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 51 51
Harry scans his Potions book. Hermione peruses the
Prophet. Ron cracks walnuts, pitching the pieces into
the fire.
RON
Have to admit, thought I was going
to miss that last one. Hope
Cormacs not taking it too hard.
Behind her paper, Hermione rolls her eyes.
RON
Has a bit of a thing for you,
Hermione. Cormac.
HERMIONE
Hes vile.
Ron considers this, then glances across the room at
Lavender.
HARRY
Ever heard of this spell?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 49.
CONTINUED: (4) 50 50
(CONTINUED)
Harry points to a notation in the margin underlined three
times: Sectumsempra. For Enemies. Hermione frowns.
HERMIONE
No I have not. And if you had a
shred of self-respect you would
turn that book in.
RON
Not bloody likely. Hes top of
the class. Even better than you,
Hermione. Slughorn thinks hes a
genius.
Hermione casts Ron a withering glance.
RON
What?
HERMIONE
Id like to know just whose book
that was. Lets take a look,
shall we?
HARRY
(holding it out of
reach)
No.
HERMIONE
(suspicious)
Why not?
HARRY
Its... old. The binding is
fragile.
HERMIONE
The binding is fragile?
She makes another grab for it, but Harry holds it clear.
Then Ginny appears, plucks it out of his hand.
GINNY
Whos the Half-Blood Prince?
HERMIONE/RON
The who?
GINNY
Thats what it says. Right here.
This Book is the Property of the
Half-Blood Prince.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 50.

Ginny points. Written on the frontispiece is: This
Book is the Property of the Half-Blood Prince.
EXT. MAIN STREET (HOGSMEADE VILLAGE) - DAY 52 52
Students lean into a bitter wind, trudging through deep
snow.
HERMIONE
For weeks you carry around this
book, practically sleep with it...
and you have no desire to find out
who The Half-Blood Prince is?
HARRY
I didnt say I wasnt curious.
And, by the way, I dont sleep
with it.
RON
(a sarcastic chortle)
Yeah. Right.
(as Harry glares)
Well, its true. I like a nice
chat before I go to bed. Now
youre always reading that bloody
book. Its like being with
Hermione.
This time its Hermiones turn to glare.
HERMIONE
Well, I was curious. So I went
to --
HARRY/RON
The library.
HARRY
And?
HERMIONE
And... nothing. Theres no
reference to the Half-Blood Prince
anywhere.
HARRY
Good. That settles it then.
Hermione starts to object, when:
HAGRID
Hey, you three!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 51.
CONTINUED: (2) 51 51
(CONTINUED)
HAGRID emerges out of the trees, beard crusted in white,
looking like a crazed Father Christmas. Behind him, deep
in the woods, DARK SILHOUETTES -- AURORS -- can be seen.
Hermione eyes them briefly, then nods to the PULSATING
BURLAP BAG Hagrid clutches in his fist.
HERMIONE
Whatve you got there, Hagrid?
Hagrid tips open the bag. The trio grimace. Hagrid
CHUCKLES.
HAGRID
Stinksap. Burn the whiskers right
off yer chin. Trees ere are
drippin with it.
HERMIONE
Stinksap? Youre not sick, are
you?
HAGRID
Its not fer me. Its fer Aragog.
Yeh remember Aragog, don yeh?
RON
Spider? About six feet tall? Ten
feet wide?
HAGRID
Thas the one. Hes taken ill.
Im hopin ter nurse im back.
Keep yer fingers crossed.
Hagrid crosses his fingers. Ron forces a grin, does the
same, shakes his head as Hagrid disappears back into the
trees.
RON
Barking. Does he not remember
that raving arachnid tried to eat
us? What?
Ron sees Hermione staring at the Aurors again.
HERMIONE
The Aurors. I know theyre here
to protect us, but... somehow I
dont feel any safer.
Just then Harry spies Slughorn, heading down towards the
Village, passing a weary Flitwick coming the other way.

HARRY
Whos up for a Butterbeer?
INT. THREE BROOMSTICKS - DAY (LATER) 53 53
As the trio enter, Harry glances round, locates Slughorn
at the bar, planted plumply on a stool.
HARRY
No. Over here.
Hermione and Ron, in the midst of seating themselves at a
perfectly acceptable -- and clean -- table, see Harry
seat himself at one strewn with the detritus of a
previous customer -- but which puts him in direct view of
Slughorn. They exchange a glance, shrug, join Harry.
Ron starts to take the chair directly opposite Harry --
blocking his view.
HARRY
No, no. Sit next to me.
Ron stops, exchanges another glance with Hermione.
RON
O-kay.
A SKINNY KID in an apron appears, tosses a FILTHY RAG
upon the table -- which begins to wipe the surface on its
own. Harry cranes his neck around the kid to keep
Slughorn in view.
SKINNY KID
Whatll we have?
HERMIONE
Three Butterbeers. Splash of
ginger in mine, please.
The kid WHISTLES and the rag leaps back into his pocket.
Harry continues to eye Slughorn, when he sees Draco.
They lock eyes briefly, then Draco exits.
RON
Aw, bloody hell...
Harry turns, sees Ron glowering at Ginny, who sits in a
dark corner with Dean, their faces lit by a guttering
candle.
HERMIONE
Oh, honestly, Ronald. Theyre
just holding hands...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 53.

(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
(as Dean kisses
Ginny)
And snogging.
RON
Id like to leave.
HERMIONE
Leave? You cant be serious.
RON
That happens to be my sister.
HERMIONE
So? What if she looked over here
and saw you snogging me? Would
you expect her to get up and
leave?
Ron blinks, utterly speechless. Then:
SLUGHORN
Harry, mboy!
Slughorns voice BOOMS so loudly even Ginny jumps -- and
catches Harry looking. As Slughorn waddles over,
SLOSHING mug in hand, Harry rises immediately -- an
action so grossly out of character that Hermione regards
him with amused curiosity.
HARRY
Hello, sir. Wonderful to see you.
Hermione, brow wrinkling, turns to Ron, silently mouths:
wonderful to see you?
HARRY
So what brings you here, sir?
SLUGHORN
Oh, the Three Broomsticks and I go
way back. Longer than Id care to
admit. In fact, I remember when
it was simply One Broomstick!
As Slughorn GUFFAWS, Harry joins in, LAUGHING HEARTILY as
well. Slughorns belly trembles next to Hermiones cheek
and his waving mug sloshes over, spattering the table.
SLUGHORN
Oops! All hands on deck, Granger!
Hermione smiles thinly, when a WHISTLE is heard and the
FILTHY RAG is back, whisking away Slughorns mess as the
SKINNY KID slides three foaming mugs onto the table.

(In the b.g. Katie Bell emerges from the back, starts for
the exit. Her friend LEANNE follows her out.)
SLUGHORN
Listen, mboy. In the old days, I
used to throw together the
occasional supper and invite a
select student or two. Would you
be game?
HARRY
Id consider it an honor, sir.
SLUGHORN
Youd be welcome too, Granger.
Hermione, in the midst of emptying her Butterbeer in one
long draw, SLAMS down her mug -- leaving behind a
mustache.
HERMIONE
Be delighted, sir.
SLUGHORN
Brilliant. Look for my owl.
(exiting, to Ron)
Good to see you, Wallenby.
Ron frowns as Slughorn waddles away, turns to Harry.
RON
Whatre you playing at?
HARRY
Dumbledore asked me to... get to
know him.
RON
Get to know him?
HARRY
Dunno. But it must be important.
Otherwise Dumbledore wouldnt ask.
Slam! Ron turns, sees that Hermione has emptied his mug
as well. Ron gestures to her upper lip.
RON
Um... Youve got a little...
Without a thought, she flicks her tongue up, wipes it
clean.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 55.

EXT. ROAD (OUTSIDE HOGSMEADE) - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 54 54
The snow falls heavily now. Ron and Harry walk together,
while Hermione trails several yards behind, pirouetting
happily, letting snowflakes fall on her tongue.
RON
Bit worried about her. Did you
hear that rubbish she was talking
back in the pub? Her and me
snogging. Ha. As if...
LEANNE (O.S.)
Katie. You dont know what it
could be!
Up ahead, Katie Bell and Leanne stand in the drifting
snow, ARGUING. Katie holds a SLENDER PACKAGE. Hermione
comes bumping up, drapes her arms over the boys.
HERMIONE
Whats up?
At that very instant, Katie Bell RISES SIX FEET INTO THE
AIR. Hair dancing violently in the wind, her face
remains eerily placid. Then she... SCREAMS. Harry and
Ron DASH FORWARD, seize her ankles. At their touch, she
FALLS to the snow, THRASHING and SHRIEKING, EYES ROLLED
UP in her skull.
LEANNE
I warned her! I warned her not to
touch it!
Hermione looks. Lying in the snow is the PACKAGE, TORN.
RON
Harry, shes swallowing her
tongue --
HERMIONE
Ill get someone --
HARRY
Theres no time!
Suddenly, a MASSIVE FIGURE LURCHES out of the WHITE:
Hagrid.
HAGRID
Get back! All o yeh!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 56.
(CONTINUED)
He says this so forcefully the others instantly obey.
Effortlessly, he scoops up Katies thrashing body and
then, as if calming a terrified animal, presses his face
close to hers and WHISPERS with great TENDERNESS:
HAGRID
Now, now. Now, now...
Over and over he repeats this, soothingly, the words like
a mantra, until Katies lids flutter and her body goes
limp.
HAGRID
Don go touchin tha but by the
wrappins. Unnerstan?
Hagrid nods darkly to the package in the snow. Harry
kneels. Poking through the paper is an ORNATE OPAL
NECKLACE. Taking off his scarf he carefully enfolds
package and rises. Then, along with the others, he
watches Hagrid lumber off, Katie cradled in his arms. In
seconds they are swallowed by the snow. The only sound
is the ROAR of the WIND.
INT. McGONAGALLS OFFICE - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON) 55 55
The necklace lies green and glittering upon McGonagalls
desk.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Youre sure Katie did not have
this in her possession when she
entered the Three Broomsticks,
Leanne?
LEANNE
Its like I said. She went to the
loo and when she came back she had
the package. She said it was
important she deliver it.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Did she say to whom?
Leanne shakes her head.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
All right, Leanne. You may go.
(as Leanne exits)
Why is it always you three? Hm?
When something happens?

RON
Believe me, Professor, Ive been
asking myself the same question
for six years.
Just then, Snape appears at the door, eyes the trio.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Severus.
SNAPE
Is this it?
McGonagall nods. Snape takes his wand, lifts the
necklace like a dead snake. Eyes it with fascination.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
What do you think?
SNAPE
I think Miss Bell is lucky to be
alive.
HARRY
She was cursed, wasnt she? I
know Katie. Off the Quidditch
pitch she wouldnt hurt a fly. If
she was bringing that to someone,
she wasnt doing it knowingly.
Snape eyes Harry levelly.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Yes. She was cursed.
HARRY
It was Malfoy.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
Thats a very serious accusation,
Potter.
SNAPE
Indeed. Your evidence?
HARRY
I... just... know.
SNAPE
You... just... know. Once again
you astonish with your gifts,
Potter, gifts mere mortals could
only dream of possessing. How
grand it must be to be the Chosen
One.

Harry and Ron lie awake in the darkened dormitory. Ron
stares at the ceiling. Harry eyes Malfoy on the
Marauders Map.
RON
What do you suppose Dean sees in
her? Ginny.
HARRY
What does she see in him?
RON
Dean? Hes brilliant.
HARRY
You called him a slick git not
five hours ago.
RON
Yeah, well, he was running his
hands all over my sister, wasnt
he? Something snaps. Youve got
to hate him. You know, on
principle.
HARRY
(troubled by this)
I suppose.
RON
So what is it? He sees in her?
HARRY
I dont know. Shes smart.
Funny. Attractive...
RON
Attractive?
HARRY
You know. Shes... got nice skin.

Skin? Youre saying Deans dating
my sister because of her skin?

Silence. Then:
RON
Hermiones got nice skin.
Wouldnt you say? As skin goes, I

HARRY
Ive never really thought about
it. But I suppose, yeah. Very
nice.
Another silence. Suddenly it feels weird.
HARRY
I think Ill be going to sleep
now.
RON
Right.
Harry sets the Map aside. We HOLD. Malfoys DOT moves
down the 7th Floor corridor... and disappears.
SLUGHORN (V.O.)
A toast!
INT. SLUGHORNS OFFICE - NIGHT 57 57
Slughorn stands at the head of a table, goblet raised to
the students seated before him, which in addition to
Harry and Hermione include MARCUS BELBY, Blaise Zabini,
NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM and the TWINS. A distinctive CRYSTAL
HOURGLASS sits in the center of the table.
SLUGHORN
To Hogwarts best and brightest!
CORMAC
Here, here!
Hermione exchanges a wry glance with Harry, who notices
that ONE SETTING is EMPTY. The twins make -- and drink --
their toast in perfect unison. Neville stares hopelessly
at the vast array of forks, knives and spoons placed
beside his plate.
NEVILLE
Which one do I use for the soup?

So tell me, Cormac. See much of

CORMAC
Yes, sir. In fact, Im meant to
go hunting with him and the
Minister for Magic over holiday.
SLUGHORN
Well, be sure to give them both my
best. What about your uncle,
Belby? Working on anything new?
(to the others)
For those of you who dont know,
Marcus uncle invented the
Wolfsbane Potion.
As he speaks, Belby never once looks up from his plate.
MARCUS BELBY
Dunno. He and me dad dont get
on. Probably because Dad thinks
potions are rubbish. Says the
only potion worth having is a
stiff one at the end of the --

SLUGHORN
And you, Miss Granger? What is it
your family does in the Muggle
world?
HERMIONE
My parents are dentists. They
tend to peoples teeth.
SLUGHORN
Fascinating. And is that
considered a dangerous profession?
HERMIONE
No. Though, a boy named Robbie
Fenwick did bite my father once.
Needed ten stitches.

As Ginny moves to her seat, Hermione WHISPERS to Harry.
HERMIONE
Look at her eyes. Theyve been
fighting again. Her and Dean.
Harry nods, then stands as Ginny reaches the table -- the
only one. Hermione notices, eyes him with amusement as
he sits.

Nothing.
As Hermione smiles, she lightly strokes the crystal
hourglass with a finger and we --

Slughorn says his goodbyes.
SLUGHORN
Thank you, one and all, for a most

Slughorn closes the door, turns, sends a FLOOR LAMP
WOBBLING and, catching it, finds Harry.
SLUGHORN
Oh. Potter.
HARRY
Sorry, sir, I was just admiring
your hourglass.
SLUGHORN
Ah, yes. A most intriguing
object. The sands run in

Nonsense. You have nothing to

classmates, well, lets just say,
theyre unlikely to make the
shelf.
Slughorn steps to a makeshift bar, begins to construct a
drink.
HARRY
The shelf, sir?
Slughorn gestures to the PHOTOGRAPHS seen earlier, now
ranged like a menagerie atop a low bookcase. Once again,
Lily Potter and Regulus Black up front.
SLUGHORN
Anyone who aspires to be anyone
hopes to end up here. Then *
again... you are already someone
arent you, Harry?
HARRY
I dont really know how to answer
that, sir.
SLUGHORN
Your mother was modest too. Your
father not so much. As you can
see, he did not make the shelf.
Slughorn smiles genially, turns back to his drink, using
a pair of TONGS to drop ice into his glass.
HARRY
Did Voldemort ever make the shelf,
sir?
Slughorn stiffens, his back to Harry. His hand trembles
and the ice slips from the tongs. Harry notices.
HARRY
You knew him, didnt you, sir?
Tom Riddle. You were his teacher.
SLUGHORN
Mr. Riddle had many teachers while

Fearing he may have overstepped...
HARRY
Im sorry, sir. Forgive me. He
killed my parents, you see...
Harry stops, frowns. Slughorn turns, studies Harry.
Nods.
SLUGHORN
Of course. Its only natural that
you should want to know more. Im
afraid I must disappoint you,
Harry. When I first met young Mr.
Riddle, he was simply a quiet,
albeit brilliant, boy committed to
becoming a first-rate wizard. Not
unlike the others Ive known. In
fact, not unlike... you. If the
monster existed, it was buried
deep within.
CLOSE ON THE HOURGLASS
Nary a grain trickles through.
INT. GREAT HALL - MORNING 59 59
Ron enters the Hall, eyes lowered, knuckles taped for
Quidditch, flexing his fingers anxiously as he makes for
the Gryffindor table. Neville passes going the other
way.
NEVILLE
Good luck, eh, Ron?
Ron nods shortly, then Seamus comes up on his side,
WHISPERS CONSPIRATORIALLY.
SEAMUS
Counting on you, Ron. Ive two
Galleons on Gryffindor.
As Seamus peels off, Ron cuts his eyes toward the
Slytherin table, where the Quidditch team sits together.
One Slytherin juts his chin toward Ron, MUTTERS
something. A few turn, snigger. Ron averts his eyes
and... almost runs into Cormac, who eyes him with disdain
as he passes. Frowning, Ron drops down opposite Harry
and Hermione. Harry eyes him briefly, knowingly, pushes
a plate across. Ron takes a fork, pokes at it glumly.

RON
So. How was it?
Hermione continues to read the Prophet, unaware of Rons
mood.
HERMIONE
How was what?
RON
(with mock
refinement)
Your dinner party.
HERMIONE
Dead boring. Though I think Harry
enjoyed dessert.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 64A.
CONTINUED: 59 59
(CONTINUED)
Harrys eyes shift, find Hermione smiling faintly from
behind the Prophet.
HERMIONE
Ol Sluggys having a Christmas
do, you know. And were meant to
bring someone...
RON
I expect youll be going with
McLaggen. Isnt he a member of
the Slug Club?
HERMIONE
Actually, I was going to ask you.
RON
Really?
HERMIONE
Really. But seeing as you have
such a distaste for the idea --
LAVENDER BROWN
(passing by)
Good luck today, Ron! I know
youll be brilliant!
Ron smiles feebly, looks back down at his plate.
Hermione stares daggers.
RON
Im resigning. After todays
match. McLaggen can have my spot.
Hearing this, Hermione turns back. Harry catches her
eye, extends a SHAKING HAND to indicate Rons mental
state.
HARRY
Have it your way. Juice?
Hermione blinks, surprised by Harrys callousness. Ron
is surprised as well -- and mildly put out.
RON
Sure...
As Harry pours, Luna arrives at the table wearing a HAT
that bears an uncanny resemblance to a real lion.
LUNA
Hello, everyone. You look
dreadful, Ron.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 65.
CONTINUED: (2) 59 59

Ron nods grimly, lifts his glass. Luna turns to Harry.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 65A.

(CONTINUED)
LUNA
Is that why you just put something
in his cup. Is it a tonic?
The tiny vial of Felix Felicis glints in Harrys palm.
HERMIONE
Dont drink that, Ron!
But Rons frozen in mid-sip, looking at Harrys palm too.
Quickly, he gulps down the rest.
HERMIONE
You could be expelled for that.
HARRY
Dunno what youre talking about.
Harry pockets the vial, winks at Luna. Ron rises.
RON
Cmon, Harry. Weve got a game to
win.
CLOSEUP - QUAFFLE
As it ROCKETS into the AIR...
EXT. QUIDDITCH PITCH - DAY 60 60
Instantly, Slytherin snatches the Quaffle and rushes en
masse toward Gryffindors end, weaving and passing with
wicked skill, culminating in a vicious, slicing shot on
goal. Just when it appears it will clear the hoop, Ron
streaks out of nowhere and sends the Quaffle screaming in
the opposite direction. Ginny pauses on her broom,
stunned.
GINNY
Whats gotten into him?
She glances up at Harry, circling high above and he
grins. Just then, Dean streaks by:
DEAN
Ginny! Lets go!
Instantly, she rolls backward, jets off and races down
her fellow Chasers. Flying in spread formation, Dean --
on the far wing -- starts the Quaffle up the line until
it lands in Ginnys hand.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 66.
CONTINUED: (4) 59 59
(CONTINUED)
Pitching herself into a wide slide to avoid a PAIR of
WHISTLING BLUDGERS, she leans recklessly off her broom
and whips the Quaffle through the goal untouched.
As the CROWD SCREAMS, Harry eyes the Gryffindor section,
where Lunas LION HAT ROARS, Lavender CLAPS for Ron and
Hermione sits with her arms crossed, a look of supreme
annoyance on her face. Harry grins, jets off.
INT. GRYFFINDOR COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 61 61
The room teems with students celebrating Gryffindors
victory. It feels like Mardi Gras. Or a mosh pit. Or a
riot. And Ron is right smack in the middle of it.
CROWD
Weasley! Weasley! Weasley!
Harry takes his backslaps on the periphery, smiling as he
sips a Butterbeer and enjoys Rons turn in the spotlight.
HERMIONE
Ron seems to be enjoying himself.
HARRY
Yep. Apparently its his lucky
day.
HERMIONE
You shouldnt have done it, Harry.
HARRY
Yeah. I suppose I couldve just
used, I dunno... a Confundus
charm?
HERMIONE
(caught)
That was different. It was
tryouts. This was an actual
match --
She stops. Harry dangles the vial. The SEALING WAX is
UNBROKEN, the bottle full.
HERMIONE
You didnt put it in?
(as he shakes his
head)
Ron only thought you did?
He nods. She POPS him playfully on the arm when WHISTLES
and CATCALLS rise. They turn to see what the commotion
is about and find, smack dab in the center of the room...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 67.
CONTINUED: 60 60
(CONTINUED)
Ron and Lavender. In a clinch. Kissing. Harry stares,
blinks, then turns back... to no one. His eyes shift,
track Hermione as she bumps through the crowd toward the
portrait hole.
EXT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 62 62
Harry leaves the ROAR of the party for the QUIET of the
corridor. Ahead, a door stands ajar. CHIRPING can be
heard.
INT. CHAMBER - SAME TIME - NIGHT 63 63
Hermione sits atop a desk, a small ring of TWITTERING
BIRDS circling her head. The birds change color as they
orbit, from sunny yellow to a dark, angry scarlet.
HERMIONE
Charms spell. Just practicing.
HARRY
Ah. Well... theyre really good.
HERMIONE
(studying her wand)
How does it feel, Harry? When you
see Dean with Ginny?
(off his look)
I know, Harry. Youre my best
friend. I see how you look at
her.
Just then the DOOR BURSTS WIDE and Ron rushes in, pulling
a GIGGLING Lavender by the hand. They stop. Take
inventory.
LAVENDER BROWN
Oops. I think this rooms taken.
As Lavender pulls Ron out, he cuts his VOICE LOW to
Harry.
RON
Whats with the birds?
Before Harry can reply, Hermione rises, points her wand.
HERMIONE
Oppugno!
Instantly the birds race like angry red bullets toward
Ron, who flees, SLAMMING SHUT the door.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 68.
CONTINUED: 61 61
(CONTINUED)
As the birds hit the door, they EXPLODE SOFTLY into small
FEATHER CLOUDS and Hermione covers her face and SOBS.
Harry goes to her, hesitates, then tentatively drapes his
arm over her. As she turns her face into his chest, he
pulls her closer, watching as, across the room, the last
scarlet feather drifts to the floor, joining the pool
already there.
HARRY
It feels like this.
EXT. CASTLE - WINDOW - SAME TIME - NIGHT 64 64
THROUGH the icy window, we see Harry cradling Hermione
within. As CAMERA DRIFTS AWAY, RISING THROUGH the
FALLING SNOW, the VIEW EXPANDS. In the Common Room, the
party rages on, while three windows down, Lavender pulls
Ron into a kiss. Figures pass by windows, including one
tall, pale boy standing at a WINDOW on the SEVENTH FLOOR:
Malfoy. As he turns away, the castle slides FROM VIEW
and the CAMERA TILTS UP TO the sky, drifting with snow.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 65 65
Tinsel decks the banisters and mistletoe droops from the
ceiling. As Ron and Harry make their way down the
crowded corridor, passing the BIRDCAGE, Ron walks with a
new air of confidence, not exactly strutting, but close.
RON
Look, I cant help it if shes got
her knickers in a twist. What Lav
and I have -- well, lets just say
there was no stopping it. Its
chemical. Will it last? Who
knows? Point is, Im a free
agent.
INT. LIBRARY - NIGHT 66 66
Harry trails Hermione through the stacks.
HERMIONE
Hes at perfect liberty to kiss
whomever he likes. I really
couldnt care less. Was I under
the impression that he and I would
be attending Slughorns Christmas
party together? Yes. Of course,
now, given the circumstances, Ive
had to make other arrangements.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 69.
CONTINUED: 63 63
(CONTINUED)
HARRY
Have you?
HERMIONE
Yes. Why?
HARRY
I just thought, you know, since
neither one of us can take who
wed really like... maybe wed go
together. As friends.
HERMIONE
(stopping)
Why didnt I think of that?
HARRY
So who are you taking?
HERMIONE
(evasively)
Um... its a surprise. Besides,
its you we need to worry about.
And you cant pick just anyone.
See that girl over there. Thats
Romilda Vane. Rumor has it shes
trying to slip you a love potion.
HARRY
Really...?
Harry considers a fine-boned GIRL with RAVEN HAIR
(ROMILDA VANE). She is exquisite, an absolute work of...
HERMIONE
(snapping fingers)
Hey! Shes only interested in you
because she thinks youre the
Chosen One. You know that, right?
HARRY
But I am the Chosen One.
Hermione cocks her head at him, exasperated.
HARRY
Okay. Kidding. Ill just ask
someone I like. Someone cool.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 70.
CONTINUED: 66 66
INT. STAIRCASE/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 67 67
Luna Lovegood, decked out in a set of SPANGLED SILVER
ROBES, and Harry, in basic black, make their way toward
the STRAINS of CHRISTMAS MUSIC, RED LANTERNS lighting
their way.
LUNA
Ive never been to this part of
the castle. At least not while
awake. I sleepwalk, you see.
Its why I wear shoes to bed.
As Harry and Luna pass out of sight, we PICK UP Malfoy,
standing in the shadows of an alcove. He watches them
go, then moves off.
INT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - 68 68
NIGHT
In the f.g., the BIRDCAGE glimmers dully in the gray
moonlight streaming through a window. Within, the TWO
BIRDS huddle quietly. We RACK FOCUS and see, THROUGH the
grid of wire, a FIGURE APPROACHING.
Draco moves down the corridor, eyes fixed oddly ahead.
He looks pale in the moonlight. In his fist he grips an
APPLE. As he passes the cage, we HOLD ON the BIRDS.
INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 69 69
Draco approaches. Stops. Turns to the wall. Closes his
eyes.
INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT (SECONDS LATER) 70 70
CAMERA GLIDES PAST dozens of TOWERING SHELVES, dust-
strewn and listing like dominoes, cluttered with all
matter of strange OBJECTS. Draco appears, his legs
pushing him on, wending his way through the narrow
passages.
NEW ANGLE - BEHIND LARGE RECTANGULAR MASS
We RISE ABOVE it, watch Draco walk directly TOWARD us and
stop. He stares at the solid mass before him. Reaches
out and takes the fringe of the tapestry covering it.
Tugs. The tapestry shivers like water to the floor,
revealing...
A CABINET, identical to the one in Borgin & Burkes.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 71.
(CONTINUED)
Draco runs a hand over the glossy finish, comes away with
DUST upon his fingertips. Glancing around, he spies a
BUST of a WOMAN wearing a TIARA, removes the SILK SCARF
hanging from her porcelain neck and gently wipes the dust
away from the cabinet. Bringing the apple up, he opens
the cabinet and places it within. Shuts it. Closing his
eyes, he MUTTERS a LOW INCANTATION, barely discernible.
He reaches out. Opens it. The apple is gone. He closes
the cabinet again. Waits. Longer this time. Finally,
he opens it. Removes the apple. Rotates it.
Someone has taken a BITE out of it.
INT. SLUGHORNS OFFICE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 71 71
FLASH! A CAMERA POPS, reveals Harry smiling with
Slughorn before a PHOTOGRAPHER (ADRIAN). The ceiling and
walls are draped with HANGINGS of emerald, crimson and
gold, so the room feels like a tent... or the inside of a
gift box. It is LOUD and packed with people.
SLUGHORN
Thank you, Adrian!
(quietly to Harry)
One of mine. Class of 78. I had
hoped for more out of him, but at
least the pictures are in focus.
(suddenly)
Oh my! Excuse me, Harry. I must
greet the new Minister of Magical
Transportation. Class of 67.
(as he goes)
Mingle, mboy! Mingle! Were all
friends here. And we run the
world.
Harry watches Slughorn make a beeline across the room,
along the way nodding to the twins, who have apparently
come with each other.
VOICE (O.S.)
Drink?
Harry turns, finds Neville standing with a tray.
HARRY
Neville...?
NEVILLE
I didnt make the cut for the Slug
Club. Its okay. Hes got Belby
handing out towels in the loo.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 72.
CONTINUED: 70 70
(CONTINUED)
As Neville turns away, Harry notices a pair of GIRLS
FEET protruding from beneath a CRIMSON HANGING. His gaze
rises, finds Hermione peeking out. As he moves off, we
see Luna talking to a small, stout bespectacled man
(ELDRED WORPLE).
ELDRED WORPLE
Lovegood, did you say? I once
encountered a seriously unbalanced
man by that name at a book
signing. Claimed to run a
magazine...
NEW ANGLE - HERMIONE - BEHIND THE HANGING - SECONDS LATER
HARRY (O.S.)
Whatre you doing?
Hermione YELPS, turns, pulls Harry behind the hanging.
Her hair is slightly askew, her lipstick a bit blurry.
HARRY
And whats happened to you?
HERMIONE
Hm? Oh, Ive just escaped -- I
mean, left Cormac. Under the
mistletoe.
HARRY
Cormac! Thats who you invited!
HERMIONE
I thought it would annoy Ron most.
But hes a menace. Hes got more
tentacles than a Snarfalump plant.
WAITER (O.S.)
Dragon tartar?
They turn, find a WAITER peeking in, tray in hand.
HERMIONE
No thank you.
WAITER
Just as well. They give one
horribly bad breath.
HERMIONE
(grabbing the tray)
On second thought -- maybe itll
keep Cormac at bay. Oh no, here
he comes!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 73.
CONTINUED: 71 71
(CONTINUED)
Hermione pops two of the Dragon blobs into her mouth,
shoves the tray in Harrys hand and flits away.
NEW ANGLE - PARTY - SAME TIME
Snape, looking bored, stands on the periphery of a
conversation, when he sees Hermione exit one side of the
hanging and Cormac enter the other.
NEW ANGLE - BEHIND THE HANGING - SAME TIME
HARRY
I think she went to powder her
nose.
Harry looks past Cormacs shoulder, out past the hanging
and sees Slughorn laughing with a guest. Cormac plucks a
dragon blob off the tray in Harrys hand, pops it.
CORMAC
Slippery little minx, your friend.
Likes to work her mouth too,
doesnt she? Yak yak yak. What
is this Im eating, by the way?
HARRY
Dragon balls.
As Cormacs face freezes, Harry starts to head toward
Slughorn when the HANGING IS SWEAP ASIDE: Snape.
SNAPE
Whats going on back here?
Cormac SPEWS raw dragon all over Snapes shoes. Snape
surveys the damage, then his eyes rise darkly.
SNAPE
Youve just bought yourself a
months detention, McLaggen.
McLaggen dashes off. Harry makes to follow.
SNAPE
Not so quick, Potter.
HARRY
I think I should rejoin the party,
sir. My date...
SNAPE
... can surely survive your
absence for another minute or two.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 74.
CONTINUED: (2) 71 71
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
Besides, I only wish to convey a
message.
HARRY
A message...?
SNAPE
From Professor Dumbledore. He
asked that I give you his best and
that he hopes you enjoy your
holiday. You see, hes traveling
and wont return until term
resumes.
HARRY
Traveling? Where?
Snape merely stares a Harry silently, briefly, then
exits, taking Harrys gaze with him, to Slughorn once
again, wildly gesturing with a full glass of wine.
MALFOY (O.S.)
Take your hands off me, you
filthy squib!
A frown overtakes Slughorns face and he turns toward the
source of the commotion, exits Harrys view. Harry
emerges from the hanging, finds Malfoy in Filchs rough
grip.
FILCH
Professor Slughorn, sir! Ive
just discovered this boy lurking
in an upstairs corridor. He
claims to have been invited to
your party.
MALFOY
Okay, okay, I was gate-crashing.
Happy?
SNAPE
Ill escort him out.
Dracos eyes shift, regard Snape. He shrugs free of
Filch.
MALFOY
Certainly... Professor.
EXT. DARK CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 72 72
CAMERA GLIDES in the DARKNESS. VOICES are HEARD.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 75.

SNAPE (CONT'D)

MALFOY (O.S.)
Maybe I did hex that Bell girl.
Maybe I didnt. Whats it to you?
Two SILHOUETTES come INTO VIEW -- Malfoy, slumped against
the wall in lazy insolence, and Snape.
SNAPE
I swore to protect you. I made
the Unbreakable Vow --
MALFOY
I dont need protection. I was
chosen for this! Out of all
others. Me! And I wont fail
him.
SNAPE
Youre afraid, Draco. You attempt
to conceal it, but its obvious.
Let me assist you --
MALFOY
No! I was chosen. This is my
moment!
Malfoy exits. Then Snape.
WIDER ANGLE
Harry is revealed in an adjacent alcove. Hes heard all.
A TRAIN is HEARD...
EXT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - MOVING - DAY 73 73
The Hogwarts Express CHUGS through a SNOWY COUNTRYSIDE.
INT. HOGWARTS EXPRESS - MOVING - DAY 74 74
Ron lies on his back, while Harry sits opposite, leafing
through the Half-Blood Princes potions book.
RON
Unbreakable Vow. Youre sure
thats what Snape said.
HARRY
Positive. Why?
RON
Its just, well, you cant break
an Unbreakable Vow.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 76.

(CONTINUED)
HARRY
Id worked that much out for
myself, funnily enough.
RON
No, you dont understand -- Oh,
bloody hell...
Lavender stands outside the compartment door. Fogging
the glass with her breath, she ETCHES Ron + Lav,
encircles it with a HEART, mimes I miss you, and exits
with a pout.
HARRY
Lovely.
RON
All she wants to do is snog me.
My lips are getting chapped.
Look.
HARRY
Ill take your word for it.
Just then, Hermione passes by, breaks stride as she spots
Lavenders handiwork, then continues on. Ron shakes his
head.
HARRY
So what happens? If you break an
Unbreakable Vow?
Ron glowers, watching as Lavenders heart slowly
VANISHES.
RON
You die.
INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 75 75
The house glows with light and HOLIDAY MUSIC rings from
the WIRELESS. Fred and George fill cups with STEAMING
NOG and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny ferry plates of food.
MRS. WEASLEY
Eat up, eat up, everyone! Theres
more to come!
Harry sits in deep conversation with LUPIN, TONKS, and
MR. WEASLEY. Ron sits by silently. Lupin looks haggard.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 77.

HARRY
Dracos plotting something, I know
it, something to do with
Voldemort. Hes been given a task
or a mission -- and Snape was
offering to help.
LUPIN
Voldemort has chosen Draco Malfoy
for a mission?
HARRY
I know it sounds mad --
LUPIN
Has it occurred to you, Harry,
that Snape was simply pretending
to offer Draco help so that he
could find out what hes up to?
HARRY
Thats not what it sounded like.
TONKS
Perhaps Harrys right, Remus. To
make an Unbreakable Vow, after
all --
LUPIN
It comes down to whether or not
you trust Dumbledores judgement.
He trusts Snape. Therefore, I do.
HARRY
But Dumbledore can make mistakes.
Hes said it himself --
LUPIN
Youre blinded by hatred.
HARRY
Im not --
LUPIN
(sharply)
You are! People are disappearing,
Harry. Daily. We can only put
our trust in a handful of people.
If we start fighting amongst
ourselves, were doomed.
Tonks gives Harry a furtive glance, as if to say, Leave
it.

EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) - NIGHT (LATER) 76 76
Within the reeds. An eerie POV. TRACKING Harry and Mr.
Weasley as they walk from the house to the adjacent
WORKSHOP.
INT. MR. WEASLEYS WORKSHOP - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 77 77
Harry trails Mr. Weasley through his cluttered workshop,
which is chock-a-block with MUGGLE OBJECTS: Steam irons.
Toasters. Clock radios. Plugs. Lots of plugs. The
PARTY can still be heard, drifting faintly from the main
house.
MR. WEASLEY
Youll have to forgive Remus. It
takes its toll -- his condition.
HARRY
(studying him)
Are you alright, Mr. Weasley?
Arthur tries a smile, but it fades. He frowns, pained.
MR. WEASLEY
Were being followed, all of us.
Molly doesnt leave the house most
days. Its not been easy.
HARRY
(a nod, then)
Did you get my owl?
MR. WEASLEY
Yes, but I thought it best if I
replied in person. If
Dumbledores traveling, its news
to the Ministry. But perhaps
thats the way Dumbledore wants
it. As for Draco Malfoy -- I know
a bit more.
HARRY
Go on.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 79.
CONTINUED: (3) 75 75
(CONTINUED)
MR. WEASLEY
I sent an agent to Borgin &
Burkes. From what you describe, I
think what you and Ron saw at the
end of the summer -- the object
that Draco seemed so interested in
-- was a Vanishing Cabinet.
HARRY
A Vanishing Cabinet?
MR. WEASLEY
They were all the rage when
Voldemort first rose to power.
You can imagine the appeal.
Should the Death Eaters come
calling, one needed only slip
inside and disappear for an hour
or two. But theyre tricky
contraptions. Require a
tremendous amount of looking
after. Eventually they fell out
of favor.
HARRY
What happened to it? The one at
Borgin & Burkes?
MR. WEASLEY
Nothing. Its still there.
Harry nods, pondering this.
MR. WEASLEY
Harry. You know, I went through
all this before -- the last time
around. Times like these -- dark
times -- do funny things to
people. It can bring them
together and it can tear them
apart. Things... speed up. Its
what happens when you dont know
if today will be your last.
EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) - NIGHT (LATER) 78 78
Similar eerie POV. On the porch, Molly and Arthur,
looking middle-aged and fragile, say goodbye to Lupin and
Tonks.

While the others TALK, Lupin stands a bit off to the
side, staring into the reeds. His nostrils flair subtly.
TONKS
It was delicious, Molly. Really.
MRS. WEASLEY
Youre sure you wont stay?
TONKS
No, we should go.

The first night of the cycle is

INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 80 80
Harry peers through the ripples of an imperfect
windowpane, studying the others below. A FLOORBOARD
CREAKS. He turns, watches Ginny emerge into the light,
in a robe, twisting her wet hair in a towel.
GINNY
Everyone gone to bed?
HARRY
Soon.
GINNY
I dont sleep these days. So I
wash my hair. Silly, right?
Harry just stares at her, the air prickling with silence.
Ginny eyes him knowingly.
GINNY
Happy Christmas, Harry.

one --
Suddenly -- throughout the reeds -- TORCHES BLAZE.
INT. WEASLEY HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 82 82
The rippled window behind Harry blushes with light.
Ginnys eyes shift from Harry to the trees beyond.
GINNY
Oh my god...
Harry turns, his BREATH FOGGING the WINDOWPANE as, far
below, FLAMES SNAKE out of the reeds and SLITHER toward
the house. Bellatrix emerges, peering up through the
darkness toward Harrys SILHOUETTE, a mad grin on her
face. As she SHRIEKS EERILY, his eyes flash with hatred.

Harry bursts through the front door, wand drawn, pelts
toward Bellatrix. She grins, turns, and vanishes into
the reeds.
MR. WEASLEY
Harry, no!
Flames race up the porch steps, climb the walls of the
house. Lupin draws his wand and races after Harry.
TONKS
Remus!
Ron, Fred and George appear, join Arthur as he dashes
toward the smoking marsh. Arthur glances back as Ginny
emerges.
MR. WEASLEY
Ginny, stay with your mother!
Without hesitation, she races for the reeds.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 82.
EXT. REEDS (SURROUNDING BURROW) - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 84 84
Harry careens through the marsh, reeds flashing past,
then spies Bellatrix. She GRINS, looking like a crazed
wood nymph, then flits off, her LAUGHTER mocking him. As
he pursues, FIRE SNAKES through the reeds toward him.
NEW ANGLE
Fred, George, Ron and Arthur fan out, running full-out,
their feet kicking up SPARKS as SHADOWS splinter
throughout the reeds. Its like chasing ghosts.
NEW ANGLES
Ginny, copper hair gleaming, races through the reeds.
Bellatrix leads Harry on, grinning madly.
Ginny comes dashing to a halt, chest heaving as she peers
into the smoking marsh. A HUGE FIGURE QUIVERS through a
veil of smoke. Ginnys eyes SHIFT, see Bellatrix racing
forward through the reeds, then SHIFT back as the veil of
smoke evaporates, reveals... Greyback. Bellatrix makes
an ODD, CLICKING noise -- like a signal -- and Greyback
edges forward, sweeping away the reeds in front of him
and revealing...
... Harry as he pelts forward.
GINNY
No, Harry! Its a trap!
Harry falters, looking toward Ginnys voice and spies
Greyback. Bellatrix stops dead, wheels in her tracks
and, seeing Ginny, SHRIEKS with RAGE. Raising her wand,
she fires a BOLT of RED LIGHT which explodes in a SHOWER
of SPARKS around Ginny. Ginny fires back, then wheels
away, flashing through the reeds and coming face to face
with...
Greyback, sharp teeth glittering.
GREYBACK
Dont you smell clean.
Just then, a BOLT OF BLUE bursts off Greybacks back and
he turns, sees Harry standing several yards off. As
Greyback gives chase, Ginny pelts after and we CUT BACK
AND FORTH BETWEEN Harry, Ginny and the beast between
them, faster and faster, their BREATHS shortening
until...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 83.
(CONTINUED)
Greyback rushes into a clearing, panting, glancing about.
Just then, TWIN BOLTS of light blast from opposite sides
of the clearing and Greyback is lifted in the air,
slammed to the ground. As he regains his feet he looks
into the reeds and sees Harry and Ginny, wands poised.
He grins... when Bellatrixs odd, CLICKING signal carries
through the night once again. Turning away, he exits.
Harry and Ginny slowly step out of the reeds, stare at
each other wordlessly. Then... Ron, Fred, George, Arthur
and Lupin come thrashing into the clearing, stop. All
around them, the reeds SMOKE, the flames dying. Across
the marsh, Bellatrixs cackle rises briefly on the air --
then all is quiet.
HERMIONE (V.O.)
Youre lucky you werent killed.
INT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY 85 85
Hermione reads the Daily Prophet as she walks alongside
Harry. The HEADLINE is GLOOMY: MORE DISAPPEARANCES.
HERMIONE
You have to realize who you are,
Harry.
HARRY
(sharply)
I know who I am, Hermione,
alright?
(frowning)
Sorry.
HERMIONE
So tell me what Arthur said.
HARRY
If Dumbledores traveling places,
its news to the Ministry. But
get this: that night at Borgin &
Burkes? It seems Draco was
looking at a Vanishing Cabinet.
HERMIONE
What would Draco want with a
Vanishing Cabinet?
HARRY
You tell me.
Hermione frowns, pondering this. Then:
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 84.
CONTINUED: 84 84

HERMIONE
He looks different, dont you
think? Draco. Almost... ill.
HARRY
Who could tell the difference?

RON (O.S.)
Lav, cmon. Of course Ill wear

They glance ahead, see Ron and a pouting Lavender. Ron
holds a GOLD CHAIN which spells out My Sweetheart.
LAVENDER BROWN
Thats my Won-Won.
HERMIONE
Excuse me, I have to go vomit.
As Hermione exits, Harry spies Ginny, in an alcove,
sitting by as Dean laughs with SEAMUS. Looking up, she
sees Harry, gives a feeble wave. He waves back and we --
CUT TO:
INT. DUMBLEDORES OFFICE - NIGHT 86 86
HARRYS FACE PLUNGING INTO WATER, BREAKING THE SURFACE...
FLASHBACK - INT. SLUGHORNS OFFICE - NIGHT (YEARS PAST) 87 87
We emerge from the CRACKLING EMBERS of a FIREPLACE. A
much younger -- and more smartly dressed Slughorn probes
a dish of CRYSTALLIZED PINEAPPLE as he holds court before
16-YEAR-OLD TOM RIDDLE and five other BOYS. The CRYSTAL
HOURGLASS sits on a side table.
TOM RIDDLE
Sir, is it true that Professor
Merrythought is retiring?
Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at
Riddle.
SLUGHORN
Now, Tom, I couldnt tell you if I
knew, could I? I must say, mboy,
Id like to know where you get
your information. More
knowledgeable than half the staff,
you are.
(as the other boys
laugh)
By the way, thank you for the
pineapple -- youre quite right,
it is my favorite -- how is it you
knew?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 85.
CONTINUED: (2) 85 85
(CONTINUED)
TOM RIDDLE
Intuition.
Riddle smiles but his expression suggests intuition had
nothing to do with it. Slughorn chuckles uneasily.
SLUGHORN
Good gracious, look at the time.
Off you go, boys, or Professor
Dippett will have us all in
detention. Lestrange, Avery,
dont forget your essays...
As the others file out, Slughorn busies himself with some
papers when -- Ping! -- he turns, finds Riddle still
there, standing by the crystal hourglass.
SLUGHORN
Look sharp, Tom. You dont want
to be caught out of bed after
hours...
TOM RIDDLE
I know a secret shortcut or two.
SLUGHORN
Yes, I imagine you do. Something
on your mind, Tom?
TOM RIDDLE
Yes, sir. I couldnt think of
anyone else to go to. The other
professors, well, theyre not like
you. They might... misunderstand.
SLUGHORN
Go on.
Riddle slips off the RING on his left hand, begins to
roll it between his fingers. It is set with a BLACK
STONE.
TOM RIDDLE
I was in the library the other
night, in the Restricted section,
and I read something rather odd,
about a bit of rare magic, and I
thought perhaps you could
illuminate me...
Suddenly, a DENSE FOG engulfs the room and SLUGHORNS
VOICE twists into an ANGRY SHRIEK:
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 86.
CONTINUED: 87 87
(CONTINUED)
SLUGHORN
I dont know anything about such
things and I wouldnt tell you if
I did! Now get out of here at
once and dont ever let me catch
you mentioning it again!
The FOG grows thicker and...
INT. DUMBLEDORES OFFICE - NIGHT (PRESENT) 88 88
... CAMERA EMERGES FROM the swirling Pensieve. Harry
blinks, finds Dumbledore studying him from across the
room.
DUMBLEDORE
Confused? I would be surprised if
you werent.
HARRY
I dont understand -- what
happened?
DUMBLEDORE
This is perhaps the most important
memory Ive collected. Its also
a lie.
(off Harrys look)
This memory has been tampered
with. In this case by the person
whose memory it is, our friend
Professor Slughorn.
HARRY
But why would he tamper with his
own memory?
DUMBLEDORE
I suspect he is ashamed of it.
HARRY
Why?
DUMBLEDORE
Why indeed.
Dumbledore trails his withered fingers in the Pensieve.
DUMBLEDORE
I asked you to get to know
Professor Slughorn and youve done
so.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 87.
CONTINUED: (2) 87 87
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
Now I want you to persuade him to
divulge his true memory. Any way
you can.
HARRY
I dont know him that well, sir --
DUMBLEDORE
Youre the Chosen One, Harry. And
Horace is, at heart, a decent man.
Provide the proper circumstances
and he will confess his sins.
Dumbledore lifts his fingers from the Pensieve, studies
them. They are, in this moment, iridescent, whole.
DUMBLEDORE
This memory is everything, Harry.
Without it, we are blind. Without
it, we leave the fate of our world
to chance. You have no choice.
You must not fail.
As Harry watches, the damp sheen enveloping Dumbledores
hand evaporates and once again his fingers decay.
INT./EXT. SLUGHORNS CLASSROOM - DAY 89 89
As the CLASS BELL RINGS, a group of FIRST YEARS rise.
SLUGHORN
Now dont forget to look over the
chapter on antidotes. Ill be
poisoning one of you next time we
meet. Im joking! Off you go!
Dont forget your rattails, Miss
Alys.
As the tiny ones scurry out, Harry is revealed, waiting
just outside the door. He enters. For a moment,
Slughorn merely HUMS over his briefcase, unaware.
Then...
SLUGHORN
Ah! If it isnt the Prince of
Potions himself! To what do I owe
the pleasure?
HARRY
Well, sir, I wondered if I might
ask you something.
SLUGHORN
Ask away, my dear boy, ask away!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 88.

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
HARRY
Well, you see, the other day I was
in the Restricted Section -- in
the library -- and I stumbled upon
something rather odd while
reading. Something about a bit of
rare magic...
SLUGHORN
Yes? And exactly what was this
rare magic.
HARRY
Im not sure... That is, I dont
recall the name... exactly. But
it got me wondering... Are there
some kinds of magic youre not
allowed to teach?
Slughorn looks up, eyes Harry carefully.
SLUGHORN
Im a Potions Professor, Harry.
Perhaps your question would best
be posed to Professor Snape.
HARRY
Yes, well, we dont exactly see
eye-to-eye, sir. What I mean to
say is, hes not like you. He
might... misunderstand.
Recognition flickers in Slughorns eyes. A glint of
fear.
SLUGHORN
There can be no light without the
dark. And so it is with magic.
Myself, I have always strived to
live within the light. I suggest
you do the same.
Slughorn gathers his briefcase, starts to exit.
HARRY
Did you say the same to Tom
Riddle, sir? When he came asking
questions.
Slughorn freezes in the doorway, then slowly turns.
SLUGHORN
Dumbledore put you up to this.
Didnt he? Didnt he!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 89.
CONTINUED: 89 89
(CONTINUED)
HARRY
Sir --
Slughorn silences him with an upraised hand. Then,
without another word, he is gone.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 90 90
Lightning flashes. Thunder rumbles. Rain lashes the
windows. Through the birdcages grid of wires someone
approaches. We RACK FOCUS... FIND Harry. As he passes,
we HOLD ON the cage. One bird is missing. Only the
BLACK one remains. As thunder BOOMS, the bird RUFFLES
its feathers.
Harry glances down the corridor adjacent, sees a FIGURE
start up the far stairwell. As the SHADOW ASCENDS, Harry
follows.
INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY 91 91
The FIGURE continues on, passes OUT OF VIEW. Harry
follows.
INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - DAY 92 92
Harry, still trailing. The FIGURE turns a corner...
INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR 93 93
... comes INTO VIEW. Its Draco. He stops halfway down,
looks back the way he came. HARRYS SHADOW scales the
wall as he approaches. Draco watches calmly, then turns,
CLOSES HIS EYES. And simply... DISAPPEARS.
Harry turns the corner. Stops. No one.
INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - DAY (SECONDS LATER) 94 94
Draco wends his way through the towering shelves, removes
the tapestry and faces the gleaming cabinet. He reaches
into his coat and carefully removes the WHITE BIRD.
Holding it in one hand, he studies it, gently stroking
its feathers with the other. For a moment, he seems lost
in the activity, lost in the birds coal black eyes, its
bobbing head. Then, gently, he places it in the cabinet
and closes the door. Waits.
When he opens the cabinet, the bird is gone. He closes
the cabinet once more.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 90.
CONTINUED: (2) 89 89
(CONTINUED)
A feather, white and gleaming, clings to the cuff of his
jacket. He takes it, turns it in the light. It is
fragile, translucent. He looks briefly lost again, then
blinks, turns back to the cabinet, slowly reaches out and
opens it. The bird is there.
Dead.
INT. COMMON ROOM - NIGHT 95 95
Hermione does her homework while Harry peers at the
Marauders Map. They are the only ones present.
HERMIONE
Did you actually expect you could
just walk up to Ol Sluggy and ask
him to reveal his deepest, darkest
secret? Honestly, Harry,
sometimes I think the Daily
Prophet should call you the Dim
One.
HARRY
Nice.
HERMIONE
(rising to go)
Youre going to have to persuade
him somehow. And now, Im afraid,
youve made it a lot harder.
HARRY
Hermione. I think Malfoys
leaving the castle.
Hermione stops dead, looks back at Harry. He nods.
HARRY
Ive seen it. Sometimes...
sometimes he just disappears off
the Map.
HERMIONE
Thats... not possible. No one
can leave the castle these days.
The Map is wrong.
HARRY
The Map is never wrong.
Hermione frowns, thinking, then shakes her head, turns
away.

INT. BOYS DORMITORY (GRYFFINDOR TOWER) - NIGHT (LATER) 96 96
Harry slumps into the darkened dormitory. Stops. On the
floor, glittering in the moonlight, is a trail of CANDY
FOILS. A bit further along, Ron sits in his PJs upon
the window sill, a HEART-SHAPED BOX by his side.
RON
Its beautiful, isnt it? The
moon.
HARRY
Divine. Had ourselves a little
late-night snack, did we?
RON
It was on your bed. The box.
Thought Id try one...
HARRY
Or twenty.
RON
I cant stop thinking about her,
Harry.
HARRY
Really? Honestly, I reckoned she
was starting to annoy you.
RON
She could never annoy me. I
think... I think I love her.
HARRY
Excuse me?
Ron nods. Harry looks bewildered.
HARRY
Well... Brilliant.
RON
Do you think she knows I exist?
HARRY
Bloody well hope so. Shes been
snogging you for three months.
RON
Snogging? Whore you talking
about?
HARRY
Whore you talking about?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 92.
(CONTINUED)
RON
Romilda, of course. Romilda Vane.
Harry stares at Ron... then grins.
HARRY
Okay. Very funny.
He turns to his bed, throws back the covers when... the
heart-shaped box caroms off his head.
HARRY
What the hell was that for?
RON
Its no joke! Im in love with
her!
HARRY
Okay! Fine! Youre in love with
her! Have you ever actually met
her!
RON
No. Can you introduce me?
Harry stops rubbing his head, eyes Ron oddly, then
glances at the candy box at his feet. There is an
envelope. Taking it, he slides out a card: Dear Harry.
Thinking sweet thoughts of you. Happy Valentines Day.
Romilda. He suppresses a smile.
HARRY
Ron, these chocolates, theyre --
Cmon. Im going to introduce you
to Romilda Vane.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 97 97
Harry leads Ron, still in his PJs, toward a door.
RON
How do I look?
HARRY
Devastatingly handsome.
Harry RAPS on the door. FOOTSTEPS -- followed by a LOUD
CRASH.
SLUGHORN (O.S.)
Damn it all!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 93.
CONTINUED: 96 96
(CONTINUED)
The door OPENS. Slughorn stands in a GREEN VELVET
DRESSING GOWN and matching NIGHTCAP, looking bleary-eyed
and annoyed. Something SMOKES on the floor behind him --
the FLOOR LAMP hed sent wobbling the night of the dinner
party.
SLUGHORN
Yes???!!!!
(warily)
Oh. Potter. Its you. Im
afraid Im busy at the moment --
He starts to close the door. Harry sticks his foot in.
HARRY
Sir. Im sorry. I wouldnt
bother you if it werent
absolutely --
RON
Wheres Romilda?
Slughorn squints over Harrys shoulder at Ron who is
doing precisely the same from the other side.
SLUGHORN
Whats the matter with Wenby?
Harry leans forward, WHISPERS into Slughorns ear. He
frowns.
SLUGHORN
Ah. Very well. Bring him in.
INT. SLUGHORNS OFFICE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 98 98
Slughorn, with practiced ease, mixes a concoction of
powders and potions into a goblet while Ron peers into a
mirror. As he paces, Harry passes the shelf and finds,
front and center, a PHOTOGRAPH of himself and Slughorn --
the one taken at the Christmas party. In deep b.g. is
photograph of Snape, as a young student, clutching his
POTIONS TEXTBOOK.
SLUGHORN
Id have thought you could whip up
a remedy for this in no time,
Harry -- an expert potioneer like
you.
HARRY
I figured this called for a more
practiced hand, sir.

RON
Hello, darling. Fancy a drink?
Slughorn and Harry turn, watch Ron WINK into the mirror.
SLUGHORN
Hm. Perhaps youre right.
As Slughorn goes back to mixing, Harry eyes him
furtively.
HARRY
Im sorry, sir. About the other
day. Our... misunderstanding.
Slughorn eyes Harry briefly, looks away.
SLUGHORN
Yes, well, water under the bridge
as they say, correct?
HARRY
I mean, Im sure youre tired of
it, after all these years. The
questions. About... Voldemort.
Slughorns mixing hand falters instantly.
SLUGHORN
Ill ask you not to use that name.
Slughorns stare is fierce. Finally, he turns, goblet in
hand, and puts a smile on his face, his voice cheery.
HARRY
Yes, sir. Its just, well,
Dumbledore once said that fear of
a name only increases fear of the
thing itself. It seemed sensible.
SLUGHORN
With all due respect, Dumbledore
sometimes forgets that most of us
do not possess powers so great
that we can risk offending the
most dangerous Dark Lord who ever
lived.
Slughorns stare is fierce, as fierce as the one
Dumbledore fixed Harry with. Finally, he turns away.
SLUGHORN
Alright, mboy! Bottoms up!

Ron drinks. Beams briefly. Then his grin sags.
RON
What happened to me?
HARRY
Love potion.
SLUGHORN
And a bloody strong one at that.
RON
I feel really... bad.
SLUGHORN
Pick-me-ups what you need, mboy.
(eying Harry again)
Do us all good, I think. Ive got
butterbeer, wine -- ah -- and a
dazzling oak-matured mead. I had
other intentions for this but
given the circumstances...
Slughorn takes a STOUT BOTTLE and fills a glass for Ron.
As Ron SIPS, Slughorn fills a pair for he and Harry.
SLUGHORN
There we are, Potter. To life!
CRASH! -- Rons glass hits the floor and he crumples to
his knees, then tumbles full out on the rug, SPASMING
horribly, FOAM oozing over his lips. Harry rushes to
him.
HARRY
Ron! Ron!!! Professor, help him!
SLUGHORN
I d-dont understand --
HARRY
Professor! Do something!!
Slughorn shuffles haplessly through his bag, MUMBLING, at
a loss. Harry turns back to Ron -- his skin is turning
BLUE.
HARRY
Hes choking!!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 96.
CONTINUED: (3) 98 98
(CONTINUED)
Harry glances about, then leaps up, and frantically
begins to strip the walls of its potion stores, looking
for something, anything. A box tumbles, something
spills: a scattering of stones, no bigger than a robins
egg, shriveled and dry. Snatching one, he wrenches open
Rons jaw and THRUSTS it deep into his THROAT. Instantly
Ron stops moving, paralyzed. The room is suddenly
silent. Hes not breathing. Harry places both hands
behind Rons head and gives it a SHAKE. Another.
HARRY
Breathe! Cmon, Ron, dont be a
prat. Breathe! BREATHE!
Harry shakes him again and again... then stops. Rons
head rolls limply from his fingers. Slughorn looks on,
mouth agape. Useless. Then... A COUGH, a great
hiccupping COUGH -- like a swimmer almost drowned -- and
Ron is back. Breathing.
RON
These girls are gonna kill me,
Harry.
Harry grins. Then Rons eyes flutter. Out. But
breathing.
INT. HOSPITAL WING - EARLY MORNING (LATER) 99 99
Harry, Dumbledore, Snape, McGonagall, Ginny and a very
somber Hermione circle Rons bed as MADAM POMFREY
ministers to him. Slughorn sits off to the side, in a
chair, looking stunned.
DUMBLEDORE
Quick thinking on your part,
Harry. Using a Bezoar. You must
be very proud of your student, eh,
Horace?
SLUGHORN
Hm? Oh. Yes... very proud.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
I think we all agree that Mr.
Potters actions were heroic. The
question is: Why were they
necessary.
DUMBLEDORE
Why indeed.
Dumbledore takes the half-empty bottle of mead, still
bearing a bit of GIFTWRAP.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 97.

DUMBLEDORE
This appears to be a gift, Horace.
You dont by chance remember who
gave you this bottle, do you --
which by the way possesses
remarkably subtle hints of
licorice and cherry when not
polluted with poison.
SLUGHORN
Actually I had intended to give it
as a gift myself.
DUMBLEDORE
To whom might I ask?
SLUGHORN
You, Headmaster.
Just then -- the DOOR BURSTS OPEN: Lavender Brown.
LAVENDER BROWN
Where is he? Wheres my Won-Won!
Has he been asking for me?
(stopping; glaring
daggers)
Whats she doing here?
HERMIONE
I might ask you the same.
LAVENDER BROWN
I happen to be his girlfriend.
HERMIONE
I happen to be his... friend.
LAVENDER BROWN
Dont make me laugh. You havent
spoken in weeks. I suppose you
want to make up with him now that
hes suddenly all interesting.
HERMIONE
Hes been poisoned, you daft
dimbo! And for the record, Ive
always found him interesting.
Hermione frowns, a bit embarrassed. Ron SNORTS,
stirring.
LAVENDER BROWN
Ha! See? He senses my presence.
Im here, Won-Won. Im here --

RON
Er... My... Nee... Er! My! Nee!
Ron, in a haze, reaches out blindly. Blushing, Hermione
takes his hand. Instantly, he falls unconscious again.
Lavender, vibrating with rage, stalks out. Dumbledore
beams.
DUMBLEDORE
Ah, to be young and feel loves
keen sting. Come, everyone, I
think Mr. Weasley is well tended.
As Dumbledore leads the others past Harry, Harry studies
him. Ginny passes, face very close, WHISPERING as she
indicates Ron and Hermione.
GINNY
Bout time, dont you think?
Harry watches her go, hopelessly smitten, sees that
Slughorn has paused in the doorway.
SLUGHORN
Ive always cherished my students.
Theyre my life...
Then he is gone too. Harry turns back, studies Hermione,
hand enfolded over Rons. She looks up, sees his faint
smile.
HERMIONE
Oh shut up.
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 100 100
Harry spoons soup into his mouth while perusing the Half-
Blood Princes Potion book, his eyes lingering, as
before, over the SECTUMSEMPRA SPELL: For Enemies. Ron
absently twirls his wand as he covertly eyes Lavender.
Hermione frowns over the Prophet when... a snowflake
falls upon her nose.
HERMIONE
Ron. Stop. Youre making it
snow.
RON
Huh?
Ron looks up, sees that it is SNOWING exclusively over
the trio. Hermione places her hand atop his wand and he
blinks, as if the gesture kindles some sense-memory.

RON
Tell me again how I broke up with
Lavender?
Harry pauses on his soup, exchanges a glance with
Hermione, who carefully withdraws her hand from Rons.
HERMIONE
Um, well, she came to visit you in
the hospital, you see, and you
talked -- I dont believe it was a
long conversation --
RON
Dont get me wrong. Im bloody
thrilled to be shot of her. Its
just she seems... a bit put out.
As one, the three glance over at Lavender and are
rewarded with a lethal squint.
HERMIONE
Does, doesnt she? And you say
you dont remember a thing from
that night? Not one thing?
RON
Well... there is... something.
(as Hermione hangs)
But no. It cant be. Besides, I
was completely boggled, wasnt I?
HERMIONE
Right. Boggled...
Hermione slumps back, frowning. Harry smiles with
amusement. Just then, a MILD COMMOTION draws his
attention. At the back of the Hall, a group of girls
surrounds a new arrival.
HERMIONE
Thats Katie. Thats Katie Bell.
Katie Bell, pale but smiling, greets the other girls.
After a moment, she looks up. Finds Harry standing
before her.
HARRY
How are you, Katie?
KATIE BELL
Give me a moment, girls.
The girls drift off. Harry watches them go, curious,
then:

I know youre going to ask, Harry.
But I dont know who cursed me.
Ive tried to remember. Honestly.
But I just... cant...
Katies eyes shift. She goes ashen. Harry turns,
follows her gaze and finds... Malfoy, staring at her.
Katie backs away, retreating to the other girls. Harry
watches her go, then looks back. Catches Malfoy fleeing
the Hall.
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 101 101
Malfoy hurtles past, forehead gleaming with sweat, passes
OUT OF FRAME. Seconds later, Harry appears, follows. As
he passes the birdcage... we HOLD. Its now EMPTY.
OMITTED 102 102
INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME - DAY 103 103
Malfoy lurches to the mirror, steadies himself against
the sink. Then, with a great, heaving shudder begins
to... CRY.
In the MIRROR, we see the bathroom DOOR ease open:
Harry. He stops, stunned. Malfoys eyes shift.
Horrified to be exposed. He wheels, points his wand.
WHOOSH! The LAMP next to Harrys head SHATTERS. FLAMES
spider up the ceiling.
Harry draws his own wand, fires back. The CISTERN behind
Malfoy EXPLODES and WATER sweeps the ceiling, rains down.
Malfoy HOWLS with RAGE. Harry readies himself.
MALFOY
Cruci--
HARRY
SECTUMSEMPRA!
BLOOD SPURTS from Malfoys face and SCARLET SLASHES OOZE
through the white of his shirt. He staggers, HOWLS again
and COLLAPSES. Harry glares at his wand in horror, then
slushes across the floor, the water running red with
Malfoys blood.

(CONTINUED)
MALFOY
Dont touch me! Dont you dare
touch me!
Harry stops dead... transfixed by a FLASH of SOMETHING
DARK pushing through the wet fabric of Malfoys
shirtsleeve. Just then... Snape BURSTS THROUGH THE DOOR.
Seeing Malfoy -- and the nature of his injuries -- he
eyes Harry with keen curiosity. Kneeling, he traces the
TIP of his WAND over Malfoys wounds, MURMURING an EERIE
INCANTATION. Instantly, the skin begins to knit itself
together. Harry backs away, Snapes ancient CHANT
ringing in his ears, blood floating like crimson flowers
on the floor, backing away until he reaches the door...
INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY 104 104
Harry sits numbly, the Potions textbook lying limp in his
hand. Hermione, Ron and Ginny sit together, a bit apart,
keeping a kind of vigil. Finally, Ginny rises, steps to
him.
GINNY
You have to get rid of it. Today.
INT. SEVENTH FLOOR CORRIDOR - DAY (LATER) 105 105
Harry, Potions book in hand, follows Ginny past the empty *
birdcage and down the corridor when she pauses, turns to *
the wall and shuts her eyes.
GINNY
Take my hand.
INT. ROOM 0F REQUIREMENT - DAY (SECONDS LATER) 106 106
Ginny and Harry materialize.
HARRY
The Room of Requirement...
Ginny nods, turns away. Harry follows.
NEW ANGLE - SECONDS LATER
Harry eyes the shelves that tower above him and the odd
things they hold: a SMALL CAGE bearing the SKELETON of
some long-dead creature. A JAR of QUIVERING EYEBALLS
which track him as he passes.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 102.
CONTINUED: 103 103
(CONTINUED)
GINNY
Over the years, if someone had a
secret, if they wanted to conceal
something, this is where they
came. Some of these things are
almost as old as the castle
itself.
HARRY
Who showed you this? First.
GINNY
Fred and George. First year. I
hid Tom Riddles diary here for a
time. Wish Id left it...
As Ginny drifts in the memory, Harry studies her, then a
SCUFFLING SOUND is heard nearby. They turn, look off.
GINNY/HARRY
(at the same time)
What was that?
They turn back, look at each other. Ginny smiles. Then:
NEW ANGLE - BEHIND VANISHING CABINET
Harry and Ginny approach. The SCUFFLING GROWS LOUDER.
Harry reaches out, pulls aside the tapestry. Reacts.
The cabinet door VIBRATES. Slowly, he opens it and...
... the BLACK BIRD flies free in a rush of FLAPPING
wings.
GINNY
See, you never know what youll
find up here.
Harry nods, looks back to the cabinet, mystified.
GINNY
All right. Close your eyes. That
way you cant be tempted.
Ginny slips the book from his fingers and starts to back
away. She mouths: Close... your... eyes. As she leaves
FRAME, CAMERA PUSHES EVER-SO-SLOWLY IN ON Harry. Still.
Waiting. For a long moment, there is only silence. Then
a shadow gently eclipses Harrys face.
GINNY
Theres something else. Another
secret of sorts. One of mine...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 103.
CONTINUED: 106 106
(CONTINUED)
Ginny leans in then and places her mouth on Harrys.
GINNY
That can stay hidden up here too,
if you like.
Harry opens his eyes, watches Ginny back away, then
disappear around the corner. He stares at the empty air,
blinking, then watches the black bird flutter overhead.
INT. CORRIDOR - LATE AFTERNOON (LATER) 107 107
Harry, looking a tad dazed, walks aimlessly.
RON (O.S.)
So. Did you and Ginny do it?
Harry jumps, watches Ron appear.
HARRY
What?
RON
You know. Hide the book.
HARRY
Oh. Yeah.
Just then, Slughorn rounds the far end of the corridor
and -- spying Harry -- does a little Oliver Hardy Oops
and retreats.
RON
Still no luck with Slughorn, I
take it?
Harry shakes his head -- then stops cold, stares at the
empty space where Slughorn stood moments before.
HARRY
Say that again.
INT. COMMON ROOM - DUSK 108 108
The tiny VIAL of FELIX FELICIS glimmers in Harrys palm
as he and Ron and Hermione huddle in the empty dormitory.
They exchange glances, then Harry brings the vial to his
lips.
HERMIONE
Well? How do you feel?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 104.
CONTINUED: (2) 106 106
(CONTINUED)
HARRY
Excellent. Really excellent.
HERMIONE
Now remember. Slughorn usually
eats early, takes a short walk and
then returns to his office.
HARRY
Right. Im going down to
Hagrids.
HERMIONE
What? No, Harry -- youve got to
go see Slughorn. We have a plan --
HARRY
No. Ive got a good feeling about
going to Hagrids. I feel like
its the place to be tonight, know
what I mean?
HERMIONE/RON
No.
HARRY
Trust me. I know what Im doing.
Or at least Felix does.
INT. CORRIDOR - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 109 109
A BOY with a PREFECTS BADGE patrols the corridor.
Bored, he ponders the progress of his FAINT MUSTACHE in a
mirror. Harry walks by, unseen.
INT. ENTRANCE HALL - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 110 110
Filch paces, standing guard while Mrs. Norris sits calmly
by. A MOUSE appears in the OPEN helmet of a SUIT OF
ARMOR, washes its face with its tiny paws, then spies
Mrs. Norris -- who HISSES. The mouse makes a quick
retreat and the FACE PLATE comes CLANGING down. As Filch
wheels, Harry strolls past.
EXT. GROUNDS/HOGWARTS CASTLE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 111 111
TWO AURORS, twin SILHOUETTES, patrol the grounds. Harry
approaches, about to intersect their paths when, at the
last second, something on the ground catches his eye. He
KNEELS, considers a BEETLE on its back, legs churning
helplessly. Harry extends his finger, letting the tiny
bug gain purchase, then tips it upright...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 105.
CONTINUED: 108 108
(CONTINUED)
...just as the Aurors SHADOWS quiver over him and
vanish. Rising, Harry starts off in one direction, then
stops, as if compelled by some inner voice, and heads the
opposite way.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 105A.
CONTINUED: 111 111
EXT. GREENHOUSE - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 112 112
Harry HUMS placidly. Up ahead, a FIGURE ripples beyond
the steamy panes of the Greenhouse. Its Slughorn,
hunched over a PLANT whose TENDRILS coil eerily,
resisting his attentions. Snip! He stealthily removes a
sprig, looks up and JUMPS.
SLUGHORN
Merlins beard, Harry!
HARRY
Sorry, sir. I shouldve announced
myself. Cleared my throat.
Coughed. You probably feared I
was Madam Sprout.
SLUGHORN
Well, yes, actually --
(paranoid)
Why would you think that?
HARRY
Just the general behavior, sir.
The sneaking around. The jumping
when you saw me. By the way,
those Tentacula leaves -- theyre
quite valuable, arent they?
SLUGHORN
Ten galleons a leaf to the right
buyer -- not that Im familiar
with such back alley transactions.
One hears rumors is all. My own
interests are purely academic, of
course.
HARRY
Personally, these plants have
always kind of freaked me out.
Harry gives a little SHIVER of the shoulders, smiles.
Slughorn cocks his head, studies him oddly.
SLUGHORN
Exactly how did you get out of the
castle, Harry?
HARRY
Through the front doors, sir. Im
off to Hagrids, you see. Hes a
very dear friend and I felt like
paying him a visit. So if you
dont mind, Ill be going.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 106.
(CONTINUED)
SLUGHORN
Harry!
HARRY
Sir?
SLUGHORN
Its nearly nightfall. Surely you
realize I cant allow you to roam
the grounds all by yourself.
HARRY
Well, then by all means come
along, sir.
EXT. HAGRIDS HUT - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 113 113
Harry appears over a rise, strolling happily along...
when Slughorn appears, huffing and puffing to keep up.
SLUGHORN
Harry, I must insist you accompany
me back to the castle immediately!
HARRY
That would be counterproductive,
sir.
SLUGHORN
And what makes you say that?
HARRY
No idea.
Slughorn frowns impatiently -- then stops, blinks.
SLUGHORN
Merlins beard...
Up ahead, Hagrid sits disconsolately upon a stump.
Nearby, Aragogs massive body lies legs up.
SLUGHORN
Is that an actual Acromantula?
HARRY
A dead one, I think, sir.
NEW ANGLE - SECONDS LATER
Harry and Slughorn approach a sullen Hagrid.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 107.
CONTINUED: 112 112
(CONTINUED)
HAGRID
Arry. Orace.
SLUGHORN
My god, dear man. How did you
ever manage to kill it?
HAGRID
Kill im! Me oldest friend, e
was!
SLUGHORN
Im sorry, I... (didnt realize.) *
Slughorn falters helplessly. Hagrid waves his hand.
HAGRID
Ah, don worry yerself. Yer not
alone. Seriously misunderstood
creatures -- spiders. Its the
eyes, I reckon. Unnerve people.
HARRY
Not to mention the pincers.
Harry makes a little claw motion with his hand, while
making a CLICKING sound. Hagrid eyes Harry curiously.
HAGRID
I reckon that too... Howd yeh get
outta the castle anyways?
HARRY
Through the front doors.
SLUGHORN
Hagrid. I wouldnt want to be
indelicate, but Acromantula venom
is uncommonly rare and, well, if
you wouldnt mind my extracting a
vial or two -- purely for academic
pursuits...
HAGRID
Don suppose its doin im any
good, izzit?
SLUGHORN
My thoughts exactly! Always carry
a few spare ampoules for just such
occasions. Old Potion Masters
habit, you know...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 108.
CONTINUED: 113 113
(CONTINUED)
Slughorn rummages about his pockets, extracts some SMALL
VIALS -- all empty save for one containing a HAIRY WORM --
then scrambles up close to Aragog. Harry and Hagrid
watch.
HAGRID
Wish yeh coulda seen im in is
prime. Magnificent e was. Jus
magnificent...
Hagrid BLINKS wildly, then takes out a handkerchief and
SNORTS LOUDLY into it. Slughorn looks up, studies
Hagrids sorry expression with empathy and steps away.
SLUGHORN
Why dont I say a few words? I
trust he had family?
HARRY
Oh yeah.
SLUGHORN
(clearing his throat)
Farewell...
Slughorn frowns.
HAGRID
Aragog.
SLUGHORN
(a nod)
Farewell, Aragog, king of
arachnids. Though your body will
decay, your spirit lingers on in
the quiet, web-spun places of your
Forest home. May your many-eyed
descendents ever flourish and your
human friends find solace for the
loss they have sustained.
HAGRID
Tha was... tha was... beautiful.
Hagrid wipes his eyes, then rises. He walks to Aragog,
studies him lovingly, then puts a shoulder to the big
beasts body... and sends him tumbling into the freshly-
dug grave adjacent with a SICKENING THUNK.
HAGRID/SLUGHORN (O.S.)
(singing)
And Odo the hero, they bore him
back home...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 108A.

INT. HAGRIDS HUT - NIGHT (HOURS LATER) 114 114
Harry, Hagrid and Slughorn sit at the massive kitchen
table, which is strewn with EMPTY WINE BOTTLES. Hagrid
and Slughorn are feeling no pain, while Harry looks clear-
eyed, focused.
HAGRID/SLUGHORN
To the place hed known as a lad,
They laid him to rest with his hat
inside out and his wand snapped in
two, which was sad...
As they finish, both men CHUCKLE. Hagrid tops off
everyones mug with a bit more wine. Harry brings his
mug to his lap... then slyly pours it into the bucket at
his feet.
HAGRID
I had im from an egg, yeh know.
Tiny little thing he was when he
hatched. No biggern a Pekinese.
SLUGHORN
Sweet. I once had a fish.
Francis. Lovely little thing.
One day I came downstairs and hed
vanished. Poof.
HAGRID
Thas odd.
SLUGHORN
Isnt it? Thats life, I suppose.
One goes along and then... poof.
HAGRID
Poof.
HARRY
Poof.
They all nod soberly. Slughorns eyes rise to the
ceiling.
SLUGHORN
Thats never unicorn hair, Hagrid?
Hagrid looks up, reels a bit. Nods.
SLUGHORN
But my dear chap, do you know how
much thats worth?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 109.
(CONTINUED)
HAGRID
No idea... no idea at all...
Thunk! Hagrids great shaggy head hits the table.
Instantly, he is SNORING, so DEEPLY his MUG shimmies
across the table. Slughorn smiles, regards Harry, who
merely stares back. Slughorn averts his eyes. Suddenly
nervous. A WIND rises outside. Windowpanes rattle.
SLUGHORN
It was a student who gave me
Francis. One spring afternoon I
discovered a bowl upon my desk
with a few inches of clear water.
There was a flower petal floating
upon the surface. As I watched,
the petal sank, but just before it
touched bottom... it transformed.
Into a wee fish. It was beautiful
magic, wondrous to behold. The
petal had come from a lily.
Hearing lily, Harry looks up. Slughorn nods.
SLUGHORN
Your mother. The day I came
downstairs, the day I found the
bowl empty... was the day she...
Slughorn falters, pain etching his face.
SLUGHORN
I know what you want. But I cant
give it to you. It will ruin
me...
Harry studies Slughorn a moment, thinking, then speaks.
HARRY
Do you know why I survived? The
night I got this.
Slughorn looks up, sees Harry pointing to his scar.
HARRY
Because of her. Because she
sacrificed herself. Because she
refused to step aside. Because
her love was more powerful than
Voldemort.
SLUGHORN
Please dont say his --
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 110.
CONTINUED: 114 114
(CONTINUED)
HARRY
Im not afraid of the name,
Professor. And Im not afraid of
him. And you shouldnt be either.
She didnt just die for me that
night. She died for you too. She
died for everyone whos ever woken
in the middle of the night afraid
a Death Eater waited on their
doorstep.
Slughorn gazes into the guttering candle before him.
HARRY
Professor. Im going to tell you
something, something others have
only guessed at. Its true. I am
the Chosen One.
Slughorn looks up. Harry nods.
HARRY
Only I can kill him. But in order
to do so, I need to know what Tom
Riddle asked you that night in
your office all those years ago.
And I need to know what you told
him.
Slughorns eyes well with tears, his hands tremble.
HARRY
Be brave, Professor. Be brave
like my mother. Otherwise you
disgrace her. Otherwise she died
for nothing. Otherwise, the bowl
remains empty forever.
Slughorn shakes his head, staring into the candle.
Finally, slowly, he removes his wand.
SLUGHORN
Dont think too badly of me once
youve seen it. You dont know
what he was like... even then.
Slughorn fishes out a tiny vial -- the one with the WORM
-- but his hand is shaking so violently, Harry has to
take it. Slowly, Slughorn raises his wand, touches it to
his temple and withdraws a LONG, SILVER THREAD. Harry
extends the vial and... it drops within.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 111.

INT. DUMBLEDORES OFFICE - NIGHT 115 115
Dumbledore holds the vial in wonderment. The worm hangs
in eerie suspension.
DUMBLEDORE
How is he? Horace?
Harry shrugs. Dumbledore nods, then tips his hand. A
LONG strand hangs suspended like glass. A pearl forms...
and as it hangs... Harrys eyes shift, notice a DRAWING
on Dumbledores desk, one of Tom Riddles drawings seen
at the orphanage, of the CAVE and the distinct
OUTCROPPING. Then... the pearl drops.
FLASHBACK - INT. SLUGHORNS OFFICE - NIGHT (YEARS PAST) 116 116
As before. The CRACKLING EMBERS of the FIRE. Slughorn,
a circle of six. Riddle commanding the room.
TOM RIDDLE
Sir, is it true that Professor
Merrythought is retiring?
Slughorn chuckles, wags a sugar-encrusted finger at
Riddle.
SLUGHORN
Now, Tom, I couldnt tell you if I
knew, could I? I must say, mboy,
Id like to know where you get
your information. More
knowledgable than half the staff,
you are.
(as the other boys
laugh)
By the way, thank you for the
pineapple -- youre quite right,
it is my favorite -- how is it you
knew?
TOM RIDDLE
Intuition.
SLUGHORN
(an uneasy chuckle)
Good gracious, is it that time
already? Off you go, boys, or
Professor Dippett will have us all
in detention. Lestrange, Avery,
dont forget your essays...
The others exit, when -- PING! -- Slughorn turns, eyes
the hourglass, finds Tom Riddle still there.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 112.
(CONTINUED)
SLUGHORN
Look sharp, Tom. You dont want
to be caught out of bed after
hours...
TOM RIDDLE
I know a secret shortcut or two.
SLUGHORN
Yes, I imagine you do. Something
on your mind, Tom?
TOM RIDDLE
Yes, sir. I couldnt think of
anyone else to go to. The other
Professors, well, theyre not like
you. They might... misunderstand.
SLUGHORN
Go on.
TOM RIDDLE
I was in the library the other
night, in the Restricted section,
and I read something rather odd,
about a bit of rare magic and I
thought perhaps you could
illuminate me. Its called, as I
understand it... a Horcrux.
Slughorns weak smile evaporates altogether.
SLUGHORN
Excuse me?
TOM RIDDLE
Horcrux. I came across the term
while reading and I didnt fully
understand it.
SLUGHORN
Im not sure what you were
reading, Tom, but thats very Dark
stuff, very Dark indeed.
TOM RIDDLE
Yes, sir. Which is why I came to
you. I mean no disrespect to the
rest of the staff, but I thought
if anyone could tell me... it
would be you.
Slughorn frowns, clearly disturbed, then speaks quietly.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 113.
CONTINUED: 116 116
(CONTINUED)
SLUGHORN
A Horcrux is an object in which a
person has concealed part of their
soul.
TOM RIDDLE
Yes, I thought it might be
something like that. But I dont
understand how that works, sir.
SLUGHORN
One splits ones soul and hides
part of it in an object. By doing
so, you are protected should you
be attacked and your body
destroyed.
TOM RIDDLE
Protected?
SLUGHORN
That part of your soul that was
hidden, lives on. In other words,
you cannot die.
Riddle nods and TURNS AWAY, staring at himself in the
MIRROR on the wall opposite. A hint of RED glints in his
eyes.
TOM RIDDLE
How does one split his soul, sir?
SLUGHORN
I think you can guess the answer
to that, Tom.
TOM RIDDLE
Murder.
SLUGHORN
Yes. Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.
After, one is never the same.
TOM RIDDLE
Out of curiosity, sir -- can you
only split your soul once? For
instance, isnt seven the most
powerfully magical number --
SLUGHORN
Seven! Merlins beard, Tom!
Isnt it bad enough to think of
killing one person? To rip the
soul into seven pieces...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 114.

(CONTINUED)
(stopping; worried)
This is all hypothetical, isnt
it, Tom? All academic...
TOM RIDDLE
Of course, sir. And I promise
Ill not speak of our
conversation. Itll be our little
secret...
Riddle reaches out then and pinches the FLAME of a
candle, killing it. As SMOKE RISES, we --
DISSOLVE INTO:
INT. DUMBLEDORES OFFICE - SAME TIME - NIGHT (PRESENT) 117 117
... the surface of the Pensieve, where Riddle quivers.
We RACK FOCUS and Dumbledores troubled face bleeds
through Riddles.
HARRY
Sir --
Dumbledore holds up his withered hand, silencing him,
turns away. Harry studies him, waiting, the hush
palpable.
DUMBLEDORE
(haunted)
This is beyond anything I
imagined. In my life I have seen
things that are unimaginably
horrific. I know now... you will
see worse.
Dumbledore looks off, his eyes distant. Harry watches
him intently, as do the HEADMASTERS in their frames
above. Finally, tentatively, Harry speaks.
HARRY
Do you mean to say he succeeded,
sir? In making a Horcrux?
DUMBLEDORE
Oh he succeeded. And not just
once. Think, Harry. Hes just
told us.
HARRY
Seven. He made seven -- the most
powerfully magical number. But...
what are they exactly?

SLUGHORN (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
DUMBLEDORE
They can be anything. The most
commonplace of objects. A ring,
for example. Or a book...
Dumbledore slides open a drawer, removes the RING and Tom
Riddles battered DIARY.
HARRY
Tom Riddles diary --
DUMBLEDORE
Its a Horcrux, yes. Four years
ago, when you saved Ginny
Weasleys life in the Chamber of
Secrets, when you brought me
this --
(holding up the
diary)
I knew. This was a different kind
of magic. Very dark. Very
powerful. But until tonight, I
had no idea just how powerful...
HARRY
And the ring...?
DUMBLEDORE
Belonged to Voldemorts mother.
It was difficult to find and...
(raising his damaged
hand)
... even more difficult to
destroy.
HARRY
But if you could find them all. *
If you did destroy each Horcrux... *
DUMBLEDORE
One destroys Voldemort.
Harry begins to reach out for the ring...
HARRY
But how would you find them? They *
could be hidden anywhere, couldnt
they...
DUMBLEDORE
True. But magic, especially Dark
magic...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 116.
CONTINUED: 117 117
(CONTINUED)
Just then, as the flash of Harrys fingers make contact
with the ring, IMAGES FLASH by in DIZZYING succession:
VOLDEMORTS FACE, twisted in pain. A DERELICT HOUSE,
deep in a haunted clearing. An ANCIENT CUP, gleaming as
it tumbles from an old womans hand. A SNAKE (NAGINI)
slithering through damp grass. Dumbledore slipping the
ring onto his finger, recoiling as his skin decays...
DUMBLEDORE
... leaves traces.
Harrys clenched hand SPASMS, RELEASES. The ring
skitters across Dumbledores desk and Harry brings a hand
to his chest, a look of bewilderment on his face.
Dumbledore watches the ring spin down, then glances at
Harry and slowly extends his own hand, lightly touching
the center of Harrys chest with the tips of ashen
fingers, as if reading braille, as if he can somehow
see into Harrys heart. Trepidation -- and recognition
-- flicker over his face.
HARRY
Its where youve been going,
isnt it, sir? When you leave the
school.
Harrys eyes drift once again to the postcard on the
desk. Dumbledore withdraws his hand, nodding, still
studying Harry oddly, his voice, when it comes, distant.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes. And I think... perhaps... I
may have found another. But this
time I cannot hope to destroy it
alone.
Harry peers into Dumbledores eyes. Dumbledore nods.
DUMBLEDORE
Once again, I shall ask too much
of you.
INT./EXT. GARGOYLE CORRIDOR - LATE DAY 118 118
Harry stands at a window, looking out. He brings his
fingers to his chest again when... Hermione comes up
behind him.
HERMIONE

Harry, Hermione and Ron walk.
HARRY
Hermione, is the Room of
Requirement unplottable?
HERMIONE
If one wants it to be. Why?
HARRY
It would explain why I thought
Malfoy was leaving the castle when
he disappeared off the Map.
HARRY
He was going to the Room of
Requirement.
HERMIONE
Of course, and that explains the
Vanishing Cabinet as well!
RON
No. I got an owl from Dad this *
morning. The one at Borgin &
Burkes? Its still there.
HARRY
But Im telling you. I saw it --
Just then, the twins appear, pass. Harry watches them, a
thought forming.
HARRY
What if there are two? Vanishing
cabinets.
HERMIONE
What if there are?
HARRY
I dont know...
Harry watches the twins vanish around a corner.
RON
Good luck, mate.
Harry turns back to Ron and Hermione, neither able to
fully conceal heir concern. He smiles reassuringly,
continues on.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 118.

HARRY
I dont need luck. Ill be with
Dumbledore.
EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - DYING LIGHT (LATER) 120 120
As Harry trots up the spiraling exterior stairs, he hears
VOICES coming from the topmost level and pauses, peering
up through the grid-like floor above: Dumbledore and
Snape.
SNAPE
Have you ever considered that you
ask too much? That you take too
much for granted? Has it ever
crossed your brilliant mind that I
dont want to do this anymore?
DUMBLEDORE
Whether it has or hasnt is
irrelevant. I will not negotiate
this with you, Severus. You
agreed. Theres nothing more to
discuss.
Harry stands poised, peering upward, where Dumbledore
squints toward the dying sun and Snape glares at his
back. Finally, Snape turns away and -- before Harry can
react -- is descending the stairs. Seeing Harry, Snape
falters briefly, then continues on without a word. As
his FOOTSTEPS fade, Harry ascends to the upper tier.
Dumbledore turns. Smiles.
DUMBLEDORE
Harry. You need a shave, my
friend.
Harry runs his hand over his face.
DUMBLEDORE
At times I forget how much youve
grown. At times I still see the
small boy from the cupboard.
(smiling)
Forgive my mawkishness, Harry. I
am an old man.
HARRY
You look the same to me, sir.
DUMBLEDORE
Like your mother, you are
unfailingly kind.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 119.
CONTINUED: 119 119
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
A trait people never fail to
undervalue. Im afraid.
Dumbledore turns then, eyes the fiery sky again.
DUMBLEDORE
The place to which we journey
tonight is exceedingly dangerous,
Harry. I promised that you could
accompany me and I stand by that
promise. But there is a
condition: You must obey any
command I give you -- without
question.
HARRY
Yes, sir.
DUMBLEDORE
Understand what Im saying.
Should I tell you to hide, you
must hide.
Harry nods. *
DUMBLEDORE
Should I tell you to run, you will *
run.
Harry nods. *
DUMBLEDORE
And should I tell you to abandon *
me and save yourself...
Harrys eyes rise, meet Dumbledores. *
DUMBLEDORE *
You will do so. *
Harry hesitates.
DUMBLEDORE
Your word, Harry.
Harry debates this internally, then, finally, nods. *
HARRY
My word.
DUMBLEDORE
Take my arm.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 120.

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
HARRY
Sir, I thought one couldnt
Apparate within Hogwarts.
DUMBLEDORE
Being me has its privileges.
The WIND GUSTS and Harry reaches out. Dumbledores CLOAK
BILLOWS and we are TOSSED INTO...
EXT. OCEAN - DUSK (MOMENTS LATER) 121 121
BLACK. Undulating. The sound of WAVES. We EASE UP, out
of the ocean. A GIANT WAVE crashes over a jagged
outcropping. As the SPRAY clears... Dumbledore and Harry
are revealed. Dumbledore eyes the TOWERING CLIFF FACE
opposite, the CAVE.
HARRY
Its there, isnt it?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 120A.
CONTINUED: (2) 120 120
EXT. CAVE - SAME TIME - DUSK 122 122
Harry and Dumbledore materialize. It is quiet here,
eerily so, the waves merely distant thunder. As Harry
glances about, Dumbledore moves to an archway, passes
beyond. Harry follows, finds Dumbledore standing below a
towering dome of rock, probing its mysteries with the
light from his wand.
DUMBLEDORE
This is the place. Oh yes, this
place has known magic.
(closing his eyes)
Where you stand, Harry, Tom Riddle
once stood many, many years ago,
when he was but a poor orphan boy
with a penchant for cruelty...
Dumbledores wand stops briefly in its arc and his face
registers pain, as if detecting some past unpleasantry.
He begins to TRACE HIS FINGERS over the surface of the
rock.
DUMBLEDORE
One wintry afternoon, he lured two
younger classmates to this cave.
What happened is unclear. But
this much is known: the children
were damaged.
Dumbledore begins to MURMUR in a STRANGE WHISPER as his
fingers play over the rock... then stop. His eyes open.
He takes a dagger from his robes and draws the blade
across his forearm, speckling the rock face with scarlet
beads.
HARRY
Sir!
The rock face SIZZLES like acid and begins to crumble,
forming a narrow opening.
DUMBLEDORE
In order to gain passage, payment
must be made, payment intended to
weaken any intruder.
HARRY
You shouldve let me, sir.
DUMBLEDORE
Oh, no, Harry. Your blood is much
more precious than mine.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 121.
EXT. ARCHWAY/UNDERGROUND LAKE - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 123 123
Dumbledore and Harry emerge onto the rim of a VAST LAKE
teeming with MIST. A chill hangs in the air.
DUMBLEDORE
Careful. The water.
Harry peers into the lake. It is black as ink.
NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
Harry follows Dumbledore around the rim of the lake. In
the center, a GREENISH GLOW shimmers in the mist.
DUMBLEDORE
Its there. The only question is
how do we get to it?
HARRY
We couldnt, perhaps, just try a
Summoning Charm, sir?
Dumbledore smiles, motions: Be my guest. Harry lifts
his wand.
HARRY
Accio Horcrux!
There is an EXPLOSION and something PALE erupts out of
the water. Harry nearly sheds his skin. Dumbledore
calmly watches it VANISH beneath the surface.
DUMBLEDORE
Perhaps not.
NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
Dumbledore leads Harry on. Stops. Takes a step back.
He CLOSES HIS EYES and to Harrys horror walks right to
the lakes edge. As the dark water laps over the toes of
his shoes, Dumbledore PASSES HIS HAND slowly through the
air, then closes it... as if gripping something
invisible. Taking his wand, he gives his CLENCHED FIST a
TAP and a thick coppery-green CHAIN appears out of thin
air, extending from the water to Dumbledores hand.
DUMBLEDORE
If you would, Harry...
Quickly Harry grasps the end of the chain and together he
and Dumbledore pull, end over end, until the PROW of a
SMALL BOAT pierces the surface, green with algae.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 122.
(CONTINUED)
NEW ANGLE - MOMENTS LATER
In eerie silence, the boat cleaves the water, ferrying
Harry and Dumbledore toward the GREENISH GLOW.
HARRY
Sir... have you ever taken Felix
Felicis?
DUMBLEDORE
Only recreationally. You see, I
believe one creates ones own
luck.
Harry looks down into the water, watches a FACE skim by
beneath the surface.
HARRY
Professor... there are bodies in
this lake.
DUMBLEDORE
Yes.
NEW ANGLE (SMALL ISLAND) - MOMENTS LATER
Here the GREENISH GLOW is ferocious. As the boat
arrives, Dumbledore steps out.
DUMBLEDORE
Remember... the water.
Harry nods, steps out carefully and joins Dumbledore at
the source of the GLOW -- a BASIN filled with a
PHOSPHORESCENT LIQUID. Dumbledore extends the tips of
his blackened fingers toward the basin, but cannot touch
the liquid.
HARRY
Do you think the Horcrux is in
there, sir?
DUMBLEDORE
Oh yes.
Dumbledore steps back, ponders the basin. Notes the
CRYSTAL GOBLET sitting beside it. Smiles ruefully.
DUMBLEDORE
It has to be drunk.
(as Harry reacts)
You remember the condition on
which I brought you with me?
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 123.
CONTINUED: 123 123
(CONTINUED)
Harry starts to respond. Stops. Nods.
DUMBLEDORE
This potion might paralyze me. It
might cause me to forget why Im
here. It might create so much
pain I beg for relief. You are
not to indulge these requests,
Harry. It is your job to make
sure I keep drinking this potion
even if you have to force it down
my throat. Understood?
HARRY
Why cant I drink it, sir?
DUMBLEDORE
Because I am much older, much
cleverer... and much less
valuable.
(taking the goblet)
Your good health, Harry.
Dumbledore dips the goblet into the gleaming liquid and
brings it to his lips. Drinks deep. Closes his eyes.
HARRY
Professor?
Dumbledore shakes his head, silencing Harry, then dips
the goblet once more. Twice more he drinks. His hand
TREMBLES and he grips the side of the basin.
HARRY
Professor? Can you hear me?
Dumbledore says nothing. The corners of his eyes TWITCH.
His hand TREMBLES, savagely this time, and he nearly
drops the goblet. Harry reaches out, steadies his hand.
DUMBLEDORE
Dont... dont make me...
Harry eyes Dumbledores anguished face, steels himself.
HARRY
You... you cant stop, Professor.
Youve got to keep drinking. Like
you said. Remember.
DUMBLEDORE
Nooooooo!!!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 124.
CONTINUED: (2) 123 123
(CONTINUED)
Harry staggers back, so primal is Dumbledores plea.
Dumbledores arm goes slack, the goblet clanging dully
against the side of the basin. Harry takes a breath,
steps forward, places his hand over Dumbledores, lifts
the cup.
DUMBLEDORE
Make it stop... Please... make it
stop...
HARRY
It will, sir. Itll stop. But
only if you drink...
Harry, his own hand TREMBLING now, tips the goblet over
Dumbledores lips.
DUMBLEDORE
My fault. Its all my fault...
Harry brings the goblet up once more. Dumbledore drinks.
DUMBLEDORE
Too much... I cant... take it...
I want... to die... kill... kill
me... KILL ME, HARRY!
HARRY
What?
DUMBLEDORE
Your word, Harry! Your word!
HARRY
No...
DUMBLEDORE
KILL ME! ITS THE ONLY WAY!
Harry stands paralyzed, unsure what to do. Then...
Dumbledore collapses, rolls onto his back. Harry pelts
forward, dips the goblet into the basin and kneels by
Dumbledore.
HARRY
One more. Just one more. And
then -- I promise... Ill do what
you say.
Dumbledore, jaw clinched shut, eyes Harry.
HARRY
I promise.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 125.
CONTINUED: (3) 123 123
(CONTINUED)
Dumbledores jaw relaxes and Harry pries open his mouth,
tips the liquid down his throat. Pain ripples through
Dumbledores face. He tries to speak, Harry eyeing him
with trepidation, fearful of what he will request. Again
and again Dumbledore struggles and then... his eyes...
open. Find Harry.
DUMBLEDORE
Water.
A shudder of relief goes through Harry. Grinning, he
leaps to the basin. A GOLDEN LOCKET now lies at the
bottom. Harry snatches it up.
DUMBLEDORE
Water...
HARRY
Aguamenti.
Instantly COLD CLEAR WATER rises in the basin.
HARRY
You did it, sir. Look --
Harry frowns. The goblet is empty.
DUMBLEDORE
Water!
Harry dips the goblet into the basin yet again, brings it
to Dumbledores lips... but once again finds it empty.
Dumbledore tries to speak, but his lips are CRACKING, his
tongue like SAND. He GULPS DRILY for air.
HARRY
Im trying, sir. Im --
Harry stops. All is silent... except for the SOFT
LAPPING of the lake. He considers the GHOSTLY SHAPES
gliding just below the surface. Deciding, he dips the
goblet into the dark water. Instantly, the lake begins
to CHURN. Harry backs away, the goblet sloshing in his
hand. FACES, pale and haunted, quiver in the roiling
water.
Harry tips the water into Dumbledores mouth. Dumbledore
blinks. His tongue probes his lower lip. Harry returns
to the waters edge, hesitates, then plunges the goblet
into water once more. Instantly, a SLIMY WHITE HAND
snags his wrist and Harry is pulled under. The goblet
bobs on the surface.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 126.
CONTINUED: (4) 123 123
(CONTINUED)
NEW ANGLE - UNDERWATER
Utterly silent. Harry twists madly as HANDS reach for
him, turning him this way and that. HAUNTED FACES float
by.
NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE
Harry breaks the surface, GASPING for air, blinking,
catching a glimpse of Dumbledore slumped against the
basin as he is...
NEW ANGLE - UNDERWATER
... pulled underwater once again, into the eerie SILENCE
of flailing arms. He shakes free again and again, but
there are too many hands, too many haunted faces. We
STAY UNDER a very long time, feel his lungs burning. His
eyes lose their focus, turning blank. Bubbles trail out
of his mouth as his face goes slack. He sinks deeper, in
free fall, takes one last look at the SHIMMERING SURFACE
ABOVE, the last thing he will see... when a SHADOW
SHIVERS briefly and...
... the SURFACE SIZZLES with RED LIGHT, like blood, then
becomes TRANSPARENT, revealing DUMBLEDORE, wand pointed
directly at the water.
NEW ANGLE - THE SURFACE
Harry breaks the surface, SPITTING UP WATER, GASPING FOR
AIR. Dumbledore staggers, slumps once more against the
basin, weakened by his effort. Harry scrambles up,
steadies him and the lake EXPLODES WITH FIRE. Harry
wheels, watches the bodies in the lake twist in pain.
DUMBLEDORE
Go...
Harry turns, confused. Dumbledores hand finds his face.
DUMBLEDORE
We have to... go.
Harry glances to the boat. Flames lick the prow,
darkening the wood, but do not destroy it. He nods.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 127.
CONTINUED: (5) 123 123
EXT. CAVE - ENTRANCE 124 124
Harry and Dumbledore emerge from the cave. Dumbledore,
pale and weak, scans the stars wearily, leans heavily on
Harry.
HARRY
Dont worry, sir. Were nearly
there.
DUMBLEDORE
I am not worried, Harry. I am
with you.
A CHOIR IN FULL VOICE RISES ON THE AIR and we --
CUT TO:
INT. GREAT HALL - SAME TIME - NIGHT 125 125
We HOLD ON the Gothic glass of the main window. Ambient
light, ominous and cool, plays across its shimmering
surface. Flitwick, arms flowing gracefully, conducts a
group of FIFTH YEARS, looks up toward the window, eyes
the pulsating light.
EXT. COURTYARD - SAME TIME - NIGHT 126 126
McGonagall stands in the courtyard as the CHOIR DRIFTS
FAINTLY on the night air. She glances up to the sky, a
curious expression on her face, then spies a pair of
First Years straggling across the courtyard.
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL
To your Houses. No dawdling.
As they scuttle off, McGonagall looks back to the sky. A
VORTEX of CLOUDS swirls eerily in on itself. We PULL
BACK...
INT. CASTLE - WINDOW - SAME TIME - NIGHT 127 127
... out of a window, its glass prickling with ambient
light, and find Snape standing silently, staring at the
gathering storm, his expression inscrutable. The choir a
murmur.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 128.
INT. COMMON ROOM - SAME TIME - NIGHT 128 128
Darker than usual. The fire muted. Ron and Hermione sit
together. Silent. Glance toward the window, the sky
beyond.
INT. HOSPITAL WING - SAME TIME - NIGHT 129 129
Dracos face, skin glimmering with the light crawling
across the ceiling above him. He stares, unblinking,
swings out of the bed. Bare feet -- Dracos -- drop to
the tiles.
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 130 130
The choir echoes eerily. SIXTH YEARS, little more than
SHADOWS, hang out, giggling in dark corners. Malfoy
glides by in his bare feet. Unnoticed. A ghost.
INT. ROOM OF REQUIREMENT - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 131 131
Dense with shadow. Strange slashes of light. Malfoy, a
shadow within shadows, pulls the tapestry from the
Vanishing Cabinet, steps back...
He stares at the monolith before him, lifts his wand and
begins to CHANT eerily. The surface of the cabinet
glimmers, atremble in the ambient light. Almost alive.
Then he stops. Looking back, his eyes haunted, he slips
away.
Light plays within the cabinet. Movement. Shadows
flicker within, coalesce. We ease up, reveal...
Bellatrix. Greyback. And a few friends. Bellatrix
steps into the light. Glances around. Grins.
EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER) 132 132
Harry and Dumbledore materialize on the rooftop.
Dumbledore glances above, notes the clouds.
HARRY
We need to get you up to the
hospital, sir, to Madam Pomfrey --
DUMBLEDORE
No. Severus... Severus is who I
need... Go and wake him... Tell
him what has happened...
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 129.

(CONTINUED)
Speak to no one else... I... I
shall wait here...
HARRY
All right. Okay.
Harry gently disengages from Dumbledore, leaves him
leaning against the ramparts. He dashes to the stairwell
door and, glancing back, sees Dumbledore MUTTERING
WEARILY as he GESTICULATES with his blackened hand.
HARRY
Sir, are you... praying?
DUMBLEDORE
(smiling faintly)
No, Harry. I do not pray. I was
merely closing a window -- the one
that had allowed us to Apparate.
Harry nods, begins to open the door, when FOOTSTEPS
sound. Draws his wand. Dumbledore cocks his head,
listening. Wincing, he straightens up, as if to mask his
infirmity.
DUMBLEDORE
Hide yourself below. And do not
speak or show yourself without my
permission. No matter what.
Harry looks down, through the LATTICEWORK at his feet, to
the tier below. The FOOTSTEPS DRAW CLOSER.
DUMBLEDORE
Do as I say, Harry.
Harry hesitates. Dumbledores eyes blaze...
DUMBLEDORE
Trust me.
Harry meets Dumbledores eyes, then pockets his wand and
slips down the stairs. As he reaches the level below,
the DOOR above FLIES OPEN. Harry peers up through the
grid, watches Malfoy come INTO VIEW.
DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Draco. What brings
you out on such a fine Spring
evening? Or is it Summer?
Draco stands poised, wand in hand, eyes darting about.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 130.

DUMBLEDORE (CONT'D)
(CONTINUED)
MALFOY
Who else is here? I heard you
talking.
DUMBLEDORE
I often talk aloud to myself. I
find it extraordinarily useful.
That which sounds sane at a
whisper can seem utterly mad when
said for all the world to hear.
Havent been whispering to
yourself, have you, Draco?
Draco eyes Dumbledore with unease.
DUMBLEDORE
You are not an assassin, Draco.
MALFOY
How do you know what I am? Ive
done things that would shock you.
DUMBLEDORE
Like cursing Katie Bell and hoping
she would, in turn, bear a cursed
necklace to me? Like replacing a
bottle of mead with one laced with
poison. Forgive me, Draco, but
these are attempts so feeble I
cannot help but question if your
heart has been really in them.
Im curious. When Voldemort gave
you this task, when he asked you
to kill me, was it in a whisper?
MALFOY
He trusts me! I was chosen!
Malfoy thrusts out his arm, pulls back his sleeve and
reveals the DARK MARK. Dumbledore barely looks at it.
DUMBLEDORE
Then I shall make it easy for you.
Slowly and without intent, Dumbledore draws his wand. *
Instantly Malfoy raises his own. *
MALFOY *
Expelliarumus! *
Harry watches in horror as Dumbledores wand flies free, *
clattering across the grid above. Malfoy watches it roll *
to a stop, a curious mixture of fear and awe at his own *
actions. Dumbledore eyes the wand, then Draco. *
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 131.

Well done, Draco. But I warn you. *
Killing is not nearly as easy. *

(CONTINUED)
Malfoy looks into Dumbledores eyes, then to the sky, at *
the gathering clouds, twisting darkly, then glances to
the stairwell. Dumbledore notices.
DUMBLEDORE
Youre not alone. Are you. There
are others. How?
A sneering smile plays over Malfoys lips.
MALFOY
The Vanishing Cabinet in the Room
of Requirement.
DUMBLEDORE
That cabinet has been broken for
years.
MALFOY
Ive been mending it.
DUMBLEDORE
Ingenious. Let me guess. It has
a sister. A twin.
MALFOY
In Borgin & Burkes. They form --
DUMBLEDORE
A passage, yes. Very good.
(eyes shifting)
I once knew a boy years ago who
made all the wrong choices. Let
me help you, Draco.
MALFOY
I dont want your help! Dont you
see! I have to do it! I have to!
(in a whisper)
Ive got to kill you or hell kill
me.
DUMBLEDORE
Say that again, Draco. But aloud
this time.
Draco looks deep into Dumbledores eyes. His hand
trembles. Transfixed, Harry watches from the shadows.
Slowly, Malfoy begins to LOWER HIS WAND... when FOOTSTEPS
ECHO. The DOOR FLIES OPEN: Bellatrix, Greyback and the
others.
BELLATRIX
Well now, look what we have here.
Dumbledore. Wandless and alone.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 132.
CONTINUED: (4) 132 132
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
Cornered in his own castle. Well
done, Draco.
Harry peers up, eyes flashing angrily at the sound of
Bellatrixs voice. He draws his wand slowly.
DUMBLEDORE
Good evening, Bellatrix. I think
introductions are in order.
BELLATRIX
Love to, Albus. But Im afraid
were on a bit of a tight
schedule.
(to Malfoy)
Do it.
Malfoys wand rises once again. Harry raises his own,
aiming through the grid, poised. Just then, a SHADOW
splinters through the columns to his right. He looks,
finds Snape, quiet as a ghost, peering upward.
Carefully, Snape draws his wand, then turns to Harry, a
finger to his lips: Shhh. Then he is drifting upward.
Silent. A ghost again.
GREYBACK
He doesnt have the stomach. Like
his father. Let me finish him.
In my own way.
BELLATRIX
No! The Dark Lord was clear. The
boys to do it. Go on, Draco.
Now!
Once again Draco raises his wand, his hand trembling.
Harrys own arm is stiff, sure. The vein in his hand
pulsates...
SNAPE (O.S.)
No.
Harry watches Snape come INTO VIEW.
DUMBLEDORE
Severus...
BELLATRIX
Well, look whos here. Hogwarts
own Defense Against the Dark Arts
teacher. Come to see the
slaughter?
DUMBLEDORE
Severus... please.

SNAPE
I gave my word. I made a vow...
Harrys eyes dart back and forth frantically, trying to
make sense of the scene playing out above. Snapes arm
rises.
SNAPE
Avada Kedavra!
A JET of GREEN LIGHT hits Dumbledore squarely in the
chest. For a second he hangs, suspended upon the
ramparts, and then... the night swallows him.
HARRY SCREAMS in RAGE. Bellatrix raises her wand to the
sky and a DEAFENING BLAST shakes the castle, masking
Harrys cry. The CLOUDS EXPLODE with GRIM LIGHT,
mutating into a SKULL. As the Death Eaters flee, Snapes
arm drops limply to his side.
SNAPE
You can no longer stay here.
Draco, stunned, stares at the empty place where
Dumbledore stood only seconds before. Snape takes him by
the scruff of the neck, forces him through the door, then
follows.
Harry scrambles up the stairs and lurches to the
ramparts, BATHED IN THE GREEN LIGHT from above. He peers
down. Agony wrecks Harrys face and he has to steady
himself. He looks up into the leering skull above. Rage
fills his eyes.
EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132A 132A
Snape leads Malfoy and Bellatrix down the spiraling
staircase.
INT. SLUGHORNS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 132B 132B
Snape leads on, his face a mask as he rounds a corner.
STUDENTS in pajamas and robes peer at the emerald sky,
then turn, stare curiously at their teacher and his
companions. Snape sweeps past wordlessly. Draco averts
his eyes. Bellatrix leers at a TINY FIRST YEAR, leans
close:
BELLATRIX
Boo.

INT. OUTSIDE GREAT HALL - NIGHT 132C 132C
Hearing FOOTSTEPS, an AUROR turns, is BLASTED off his
feet as Snape and the others appear. Bellatrix lags,
then steps to the TOWERING DOORS of the Hall, peering
upward, past the FLOATING CANDLES to the vaulted ceiling,
solemn as a church. Raising her wand, she sends a FIERY
BOLT toward the GRAND WINDOW opposite. As it EXPLODES, a
BLAST of COLD AIR sweeps the room, EXTINGUISHING THE
CANDLES. Snape turns, looks back. Bellatrix simply
GRINS, a mad child.
INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132D 132D
As Bellatrixs BLAST ECHOES, Ron and Hermione -- racing
side by side in their regular clothes -- glance at one
another, dash on.
EXT. CASTLE - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132E 132E
Filch, on guard, looks up, watches SHARDS OF GLASS spill
from the window like jewels, standing transfixed as the
fragments lash his face, draw blood.
INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132F 132F
Harry races on, glances out a window and sees Snape and
the others racing across a lower courtyard.
EXT. LOWER COURTYARD - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132G 132G
Malfoy slows, glancing upward, watching the students come
to the windows and peer out at the emerald sky. They
look like ghosts in their nightclothes.
BELLATRIX
Draco! Draco!
(as he turns)
Theyll kill you if you stay.
INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132H 132H
Hermione and Ron push through the other students, who are
confused, crying. McGonagall appears, meets Ron and
Hermiones glance, continues on.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 134A.
EXT. HAGRIDS HUT/GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 132I 132I
Quiet here. A VIEW TOWARD the castle. We HOLD. Slowly
FIGURES appear on the horizon. The Death Eaters.
Greyback. Bellatrix, Draco. And Snape.
EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - NIGHT 133 133
Harry bursts through the entrance doors, wand in hand.
Before him, the grounds shimmer eerily in the GREEN GLOW.
He sees the FIGURES FLEEING towards Hagrids Hut.
EXT. HAGRIDS HUT / GROUNDS - SAME TIME - NIGHT 134 134
Snape and the others race toward the edge of the grounds.
Suddenly, Snape pulls up, looks back. Sees Harry
sprinting toward him. Malfoy, looking edgy, is watching
Harry too.
SNAPE
Go on!
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 134B.
(CONTINUED)
Just then a GIANT FIREBALL erupts into the sky. Snape
wheels, sees Bellatrix and the others silhouetted against
the flames. Theyve set Hagrids Hut ablaze. Malfoy
stands paralyzed.
SNAPE
Go on!
NEW ANGLE - HARRY
Running. Harry bolts forth, wand in hand, vengeance in
his eyes. Up ahead, Snape stands stolidly, tall and
black against the raging fire. Harry points his wand,
fires a JET of RED LIGHT. Snape doesnt move, merely
lets it streak by his head. Harry stops, chest heaving,
and takes aim again.
HARRY
Cruciatus!
Snape raises his wand, parries the curse with ease.
HARRY
Incacerata!
Once again, Snape deflects the spell.
HARRY
Impedimenta!
Another lazy flick of the arm, another curse defeated.
Harry drops his arm in frustration.
HARRY
Fight! Fight back, you coward!
With staggering quickness, Snapes wand whips forth and
Harry is off his heels and crashing to the earth.
SNAPE
Dont ever associate that word and
my name again.
Harry raises himself up on one knee, points his wand
when... a JET of RED LIGHT sends him crashing back into
the grass. Snape wheels, sees Bellatrix standing behind.
SNAPE
No! He belongs to the Dark Lord!
Bellatrix eyes Snape levelly, then turns, trots off.
Snape glances at Harry, then turns away himself, walking.
Harry grimaces, pulls himself to his feet and aims one
last time.

HARRY
Sectumsempra!
Bang! Snape wheels and once more sends Harry flying onto
his back. Harry stares at the stars as they wheel over
him, when Snape comes INTO VIEW.
SNAPE
You dare use my own spells against
me, Potter?
Harry goes still. His eyes shift, meet Snapes.
SNAPE
You may have gotten your mothers
eyes, but youre as dim as your
father. Yes. Its me. Im the
Half-Blood Prince.
Snape kicks Harrys wand aside and turns away, joining
Malfoy and the others where they wait beyond the flaming
ruins of Hagrids Hut. They head for the darkness of the
treeline. And VANISH. Harry pounds his fist into the
ground, then stops.
HARRY
Hagrid... HAGRID!
Harry races toward the hut when the DOOR flies off its
hinges. Seconds later, Hagrid stumbles out, beard
SMOKING.
HARRY
Hagrid! You alright?
HAGRID
Take moren tha ter finish me
off. Not sure about me ouse,
tho. But if anybody can put it
righ, Dumbledore can.
HARRY
Hagrid, Dumbledore --
HAGRID
Only thing I cant reckon is wha
Snape was doin with tha lot.
Hagrid turns then, sees the HUGE THRONG of STUDENTS and
STAFF assembled outside the castle.
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 136.
CONTINUED: (2) 134 134
(CONTINUED)
HAGRID
An whas this wi the Dark Mar?
Whos been killed?
(stopping)
Wheres Dumbledore, arry?
Wheres Dumbledore!!
Harry tries to speak, but he is mute. Hagrid goes still.
EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - MIDDLE COURTYARD - NIGHT 135 135
Ron, Hermione and Ginny stand with the staff. They turn
and watch the throng of students part for Harry and
Hagrid.
Hagrid stops short, shattered by what he sees. Harry
pushes on, kneels. Dumbledores eyes are closed, his
face peaceful. Harry straightens his half-moon
spectacles, wipes a trickle of blood from his mouth.
Runs the back of his hand, gently, over the weathered
cheek.
Then he notices something lying beside Dumbledores ashen
hand: the locket. He takes it, considers it numbly.
Then begins to cry, great shudders of grief wracking his
body. Hermione gives Ginny a nudge and she steps
forward, drops beside him. At her touch, his head falls
on her shoulder and she begins to stroke him. Ron looks
on. Understands all.
McGonagall lifts a trembling wand to the sky and slowly
the TIP GLOWS to life. One after another, students and
staff do the same, lifting their wands in salute. As
CAMERA RISES, the pinpricks coalesce into one BLAZING
FIRE. The sky, briefly emerald, turns black once more.
The Dark Mark vanishes.
EXT. HOGWARTS CASTLE - DAY 136 136
The castle sits silent. BLACK BANNERS fly on the
parapets.
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 136A 136A *
Silent. Desolate. *
INT. GREAT HALL - DAY 137 137
Dumbledores chair -- empty. The House tables -- empty.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 138 138
A tapestry tosses lightly in the breeze. The PERCH in *
the empty birdcage sways, SQUEAKING gently. *
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 137A.
INT. DUMBLEDORES OFFICE - DAY 139 139
Quiet. Still. Empty. Then: *
The door eases OPEN and Harry enters. For a moment, he *
simply stands staring. Taking inventory. Spying *
something, he crosses to the great desk opposite. Looks *
down. *
Dumbledores wand. *
Reaching out, Harry takes it in hand. Old, oft-used and *
bearing the impression of its owners fingers, it is a *
strangely beautiful object. Harry traces his thumb *
lightly over the wood, transfixed, when... *
... McGonagall enters. *
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL *
Potter. *
He doesnt respond, lost in the wand. McGonagalls eyes *
drift to it, briefly, then study Harrys face. She *
frowns, trying to call forth some words. *
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL *
Potter, in light of whats *
happened... should you feel the *
need to talk to someone... *
She falters. Harry gently sets the wand back upon the *
desk, retraces his steps to the door, pauses for one last *
look. *
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL *
You should know... Professor *
Dumbledore... *
Harry turns then, studying her drawn face, no words *
necessary. At a loss, she finishes quietly: *
PROFESSOR McGONAGALL *
You meant a great deal to him. *
Harrys eyes rise. High upon the wall, the past *
Headmasters snooze in their frames. The last looks *
remarkably peaceful, the trace of a smile on his lips as *
he sleeps. *
Dumbledore. *
Harry nods, lingering one last moment, and exits. *
*
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 138.
INT. TOWER DORMITORY - DAY 140 140
Harry stands at the window, alone in the empty dormitory.
At the doorway, he looks back. As if committing it to
memory.
INT. COMMON ROOM - DAY (MOMENTS LATER) 141 141
Harry starts down the stairs, stops. Hermione, Ron and
Ginny sit talking quietly. Ginny looks up. Smiles
softly.
EXT. ASTRONOMY TOWER - DAY 142 142
Harry and Hermione stand by the ramparts while Ron and *
Ginny stand further along, just out of earshot. Harry *
stares into the distance at the ashes of Hagrids Hut.
Hermione toys with the locket before them. *
HERMIONE *
Do you think he wouldve done it.
Draco?
HARRY
No. He was lowering his wand. In
the end, it was Snape. It was
always Snape. And I did
nothing...
Hermione studies Harry, takes the locket from the *
rampart.
HERMIONE *
Strange. Thinking this is a piece *
of Voldemorts soul...
HARRY
Yeah, strange. Only... its not. *
Its a fake. *
As Hermione reacts, Harry nods. *
*
HARRY
Go on. Open it. *
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 138A.
(CONTINUED)
Hermione pries open the locket and removes a piece of *
PARCHMENT folded in a tight square. READS:
HERMIONE *
To the Dark Lord. I know I will
be dead long before you read this
but I want you to know that it was
I who discovered your secret. I
have stolen the real Horcrux and
intend to destroy it as soon as I
can. I face death in the hope
that when you meet your match, you
will be mortal once more. R.A.B.
(looking up)
R.A.B.?
HARRY
Dunno. But whoever they are, they
have the real Horcrux. Which
means, it was a waste. All of it.
Hermione studies Harrys troubled face, then glances at *
Ginny and Ron. *
HERMIONE *
Rons okay with it, you know. You *
and Ginny. But if I were you, *
when hes around, Id keep the *
snogging to a minimum.
Hermione smiles faintly, trying to cheer him, but Harry *
merely nods, looks away again. *
HARRY
Im not coming back, Hermione. *
Hermione nods. *
HERMIONE *
We reckoned -- Ron and me. *
HARRY
I have to finish what Dumbledore *
started. Im not sure where that *
will lead me... but Ill let you *
and Ron konw where I am -- when I *
can. (ALT: I have to finish what *
Dumbledore started. And... I have *
to do it alone.) *
HERMIONE *
Ive always admired your courage, *
Harry, but sometimes... youre *
really thick. *
*
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 139.

(CONTINUED)
Harry turns, looking at her in surprise. *
HERMIONE
You dont honestly think you can *
find all those Horcruxes by *
yourself, do you? *
(leaning in; a *
whisper) *
You need us, Harry. *
Harry just stares at her. She cocks her head, smiling, *
doing her best to coax one out of him. Finally, he does, *
briefly. *
HARRY *
Yeah. I do. But do me a favor. *
When Im around? Keep the *
snogging to a minimum. *
Hermione looks stunned. Reddens. *
HERMIONE *
Like thats going to happen. *
She glances at Ron, shakes her head. *
HERMIONE *
Besides, hes barking. *
HARRY *
Funny, he says the same about you. *
HERMIONE *
Yes, but Im exceptionally *
perceptive. *
HARRY *
Youre brilliant. You both are. *
Harry looks off again and Hermione follows his gaze. She *
looks out over the grounds. Slowly losing herself. We *
can tell. Shes taking inventory. Pressing it into a *
scrapbook. *
HERMIONE *
Do you think well ever... (come *
back?) *
She stops. Her eyes glisten briefly. Then she fights it *
back. Tough. Harry fights back his own emotion, reaches *
over and gives her hand a brief squeeze. Then releases *
her. *
*
HARRY POTTER... HALF-BLOOD PRINCE - Rev. 11/6/07 140.

HARRY
I dont know. *
Hermione nods and Harrys eyes shift, consider Ron and *
Ginny. As if sensing his gaze, Ron turns and they *
exchange a look, something unspoken but true passing *
between them. *
Just then a SONG rises on the air, mournful and haunting, *
and seconds later a BIRD soars out from beyond the *
tallest turret and begins to stitch its way across the *
sky. *
Ron and Ginny cross to Harry and Hermione, lean against *
the rampart. All look to the horizon, watching the bird *
grow smaller while its song -- magically -- endures. *
No one says a word. *
FADE OUT.

Our world has prehaps faced no greater

But I say this to our citizens.
We, ever your servants ...

and repel the forces that seek to take it from you.
Your ministry remains strong.

why we have to leave?.
Because its

Ron??
evening is finished.
Obliviate. / i
HARRY POTTER AND
THE DEATHLY HALLOWS / i
Severus, I was beginning to worry
you'd lost your way...
...Come, we have saved you a seat
- You bring news, I trust
- It will happen next Saturday.
At nightfall
I've heard differently
my lord.
Dawlish, the auror has let slip
that the Potter boy will not be moved
until the 30th of this month.
The day before he turns 17
This is a false trail
The auror office no longer plays any part
in the protection of Harry Potter.
Those closest to him think
that we have infiltrated the Ministry.
Well, they got that right., didn't they ?
What say you , Pius?
One hears many things
my lord.
But whether the truth is
among them, is not clear.
Spoken like a true politican.
you will I think
prove most useful, Pius.
- Where will he be taken the boy?
- To a safe house.
Most likely the home
of someone in the Order.
I'm told its been given protection
of every manner possible
Once there it will be
impractical to attack him
My lord, I'd like to
volunteer myself for this task.
I want to kill the boy
Wormtail
Have i not spoken to you
about keeping our guest quiet ?
Yes, my lord.
Right away, my lord.
As inspiring as I find
your bloodlust, Bellatrix ...
... I must be the one
to kill Harry Potter.
But I face an
unfortunate complication.
My wand and the Potters
share the same core.
They are, someways, twins.
We can wound but not
fatally harm one another.
If I am to kill him ...
... must do it with
anothers wand
Well, surely one of you
would like the honor
What about you, Lucius?
- My lord?
- "My Lord"?
I require your wand.
- Do I detect elm?
- Yes, my Lord.
And the core?
- Dragon heartstring my lord
- Dragon heartstringt?
To those of you who do not know ...
...we are joined here tonight
by Miss Charity Burbage ...
... who until recently taught
at Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry
Her speciality was muggle studies
It is Miss Burbage's belief that
Muggles are not so different. than us
She would given her way ...
... have us mate with them.
To her the mixture of magical and
Muggle blood is not an abomination ...
... but something,
to be encouraged.
Severus.
Severus, please.
We're friends.
Nagini.
Dinner.
- Hello Harry!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- You're looking fit.
Yeah, he is absolutely gorgeous...
Lets say we get undercover,
before someone blows you..
Do you?
Kingsley, weren't you looking
after the PrimeMinister?
You are more important.
- Hello Harry. Bill Weasley.
- Pleasure to meet you.
- He wasn't always so handsome
- Daredevil.
- True enough
Happened while fighting a werewolf called Greyback
I Would like to return the favour one day
You're still beautiful to me, Billy.
Just remember, Fleur
Bill takes his steak on the raw side now
My husband the joker.
By the way,
Wait till you hear the news....
Can't wait no time for cozy catch up.
We have to get the hell out of here.
Potter, you are underage, which means
you've still got the trace on you.
What is the trace?
If you sneezed, the Ministry
will know who wiped your nose.
The point is that we have to use those modes,
of transport which the trace can't detect
Brooms, thestrals and like
We'll go in pairs.
That way if anything is out there waiting
for us...I reckon there will be
... they won't know which
Harry Potter is the real one.
The real one ?
I do believe you are fully
aware of this particular brew
- No, absolutely not.
- I told you he won't take it well.
No, if you think that I'll let,
everyone risk their lives for me ...
- Have done if before, haven't we.
- No, no, this is different.
Taking that becoming me.
No!
Well none of us really
fancy it mate
Yes, imagine if something went wrong,
and we be stuck as scrawny specky gits forever
Everyone here is of age, Potter.
They all agreed to take the risk.
Technically I'd been coerced
Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. Aways been a huge admirer.
Nip it, Mundungus.
- Alright Granger its discussed
- Blimey, Hermione!
Put it in there, please.
For those of you who haven't taken
polyjuice potion before, fair warning.
Tastes like goblin piss
Have enough of that
experience do you Mad-eye?
Just trying to defuse the
tension.
- Wow! we are identical!
- Not yet you are not.
- Haven't you got something a bit more sporting?
- Yeah I don't really fancy this color.
Well fancy this , you are not you
so shove it up and strip
Alright, Alright
You too, Potter.
Bill, look away, I'm hideous.
- Ginny did lie about that tattoo.
- Harry, your eyesight really is aweful.
Well,we will be pairing off.
Everyone will have a protector.
Mundungus, stick tight to me.
I want to keep an eye on you
- As for Harry ...
- Yes?
The real Harry.
Where the devil are you anyway?
- Here.
- You ride with Hagrid.
I brough you here 16 years ago,
when you were no bigger than a bowtruckle.
Seems only right that
I should be the one that takes you away.
Yes this is all very touching.
Lets go !
Head for the Burrow.
We rendezvous you there.
- On the count of three!
- Hold tight, Harry!
One!
Two!
Three!
Help!
- Hagrid, we have to help the others!
- We can't do that, Harry
Mad-Eye's orders.
Hang on!
Stupefy! / i
Hang on, Harry!
Hagrid!
No! No!
Harry!
Hagrid! Hagrid!
What happened?
Where are the others?
Is noone else back?
They were on to us
way from the start, Molly.
We didn't stand a chance.
Well, thank goodness
you two are allright
Death Eaters were waiting
for us. Attacked us.
George and Ron
should have been back.
A dad with Fred too.
Here.
Quick.
Into the house.
Oh My boy ...
- Come here!
- What are you doing?
What creature sat in the corner the first time when
Harry Potter visited of my office in Hogwarts.
- Are you mad?
- What creature?
A Grindylow.
We have been betrayed .
Voldemort knew
you were being moved tonight.
I had to make sure,
you were not an imposter.
Wait!
The last words Albus Dumbledore,
spoke to the pair of us.
"Harry is the best hope we have."
"Trust him."
What gave you away?
Hedwig i think.
She was trying to protect me.
Thanks.
He deserves that. Brilliant he was.
I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for him.
Really?
Why is it always so suprising?
We are the last back?.
Where's George?
How are you feeling, Georgie?
- Saintlike.
- Come again?
Saintlike.
Im holey. I'm holey fred
Get it?
A whole wide world of ear related
humour and you go for holey.
Pathetic.
I'm still better looking than you.
Mad-Eye is dead.
Mundungus took one look at Voldemort
and disapparated.
head for the burrow / i
- Seven. Seven.
- This is more than I ever imagined. / I
- Horcruxes ...
- They could be hidden anywhere, couldn't they. / i

into seven pieces .../ i
- If we destroy each Horcruxes ...
- One destroys Voldemort. / I
- Harry ...
- Trust me. / I
- Do not lie to me. Do not lie to me.
- Not / i
Going somewhere?
Nobody else is going to die.
Not for me.
Because of you?
You think Mad-Eye died
for you?
Think George
took that curse for you?
You maybe the chosen one, mate ...
... but this is a whole lot bigger than that.
Its always been bigger than that.
- Come with me.
- And leave Hermione?
Are you mad.
We won't last two days.
without her
Do not tell her
I said that.
Besides you still have the trace on you,
you still got the wedding ...
... the wedding ...
- I don't care about a wedding.
I'm Sorry, no matter whose it is.
I have to start finding these Horcruxes?.
They are our only chance,
to beat him.
And the longer we stay here,
the stronger he gets.
Try and understand me
You will only be doing him a favor.
Do you think he knows?
I mean they are bits of his soul,
the Horcruxes.
Pieces of him.
When Dumbledore destroyed the Ring ...
... and you destroyed
Tom Riddle's Diary.
He must have felt something?.
To kill thei other Horcruxes,
we have to find them?.
Where are they?
Where do we start?
DUMBLEDORE'S DARK SECRETS REVEALED

It seems silly doesn't it

considering whats

Maybe thats the best reason to have it.
inspite of whats going on
Morning.
All together now!
One! Two! Three!
How it it going?
Great.
Well, hell.
What is the Minister of Magic doing here?
To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?
I think we both know the answer
to that question, Mr. Potter.
Herein is is said forth
...?
the last will and testament of ...
... Albus Percival Wulfric
Brian Dumbledore.
First, to
Ronald Billius Weasley ... "
"... I leave my delumintor."
"A device, of my own making ..."
"... In hope when things
seem most dark ... "
"... it will show you the light."
- Dumbledore left this for me?
- Yes.
Really.
What is it?
Super.
" To Hermione Jean Granger ..."
"... I leave my copy of
Tales of Beedle the Bard / i ..."
"... In the hope that she finds it
entertaining and instructive "
Mom used to tell me those.
The wizard and the hopping pot,
Babbity Rabbity and the Cackling Stump ...
Come on.
Babbity Rabbity...
No?
"To Harry James Potter ..."
"... I leave the snitch he caught
in his first match at Hogwarts... "
"... As a reminder of
rewards of perseverance ... "
"... And skill."
Is that it then?
Not quite.
Dumbledore left you ...
... a second bequest
The sword of
Godric Gryffindor.
Unfortunately the sword of Gryffindor
was not Dumbledore's to give away.
As an important
historical artifact it belongs ...
to Harry.
It belongs to Harry.
It came to him when he most
needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.
The sword may present itself to
any worthy Gryffindor, Miss Granger ...
... but that does not make it
that wizards property
Unfortunately the current
whereabout of the sword are unknown.
Excuse me?
The Sword is Missing.
I don't know what you are up,
to, Mr. Potter ...
... but you can't fight
this war on your own
He is too strong.
Hello, Harry.
i've interrupted
deep thoughts, haven't I?
I see a growing
in your eyes
Of course not.
How are you, Luna?
Very well, The garden
gnome has bitten my finger...
Gnome saliva is s very benificial.
Xenophilius Lovegood.
We live just over the hill.
Pleasure to meet you, sir.
I trust you know
Mr. Potter ...
... we at the Quibbler, disagree with Daily Prophet,
and have always fully supported Dumbledore ...
... during his lifetime and after his death,
and we also support you.
Thank you.
Come Daddy.
Harry does not want to talk to us right now?.
He is just too polite
to point it out.
Harry Potter ...
Excuse me, sir.
- May I sit down?
- Mr. Potter.
By all means...here
I found what you wrote
in the Daily Prophet.
really moving.
You obviously knew
Dumbledore well.
Well, I certainly
knew him the longest.
Unless we count his brother Aberforth,
and somehow people never do seem to count Aberforth.
I didn't even know
he had a brother.
Ah Well, Dumbledore was always
very private, even as a boy.
Do not despair, Elphias.
I'm told he has been thoroughly
unrevealed by Rita Skeeter.
in 800 pages.
Word has it
that someone talked to her.
Someone who knew the
Dumbledore family well.
Both you and I know
who that is , Elphias.
Monstrous betrayal.
Who are we talking about?
Bathilda Bagshot.
- Who?
- Oh, boy ...
... she's only the most celebrated
magical historian of the last century.
She was as close to Dumbledore
as anyone
Sure Rita Skeeter thought it well
worth a trip to Godric's Hollow ...
... to take a peek into
that old birds records.
Godris Hollow?
Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric's Hollow?
Thats where she first met Dumbledore.
You don't say thar he lived there too.
His family moved
there ...
... after his father killed
those three Muggles.
It was a quite the scandal.
Honestly my boy ...
... are you sure
that you knew him at all?
Ministry has fallen. / i
Minister of Magic is dead. / i
They are coming. / i
They are coming. / i
Nice meeting you,
Mr. Potter.
Ginny!
Go! Go!
Where are we?
Shaftesbury Avenue.
I used to come up here to theaters
with mom and dad.
I do not know why I though of it. It was
the first thing to come to my head
This way.
Have you ever seen this before?
Kreacher?
- It is Master Regulus's locket!
- There were two, weren't there?
Where is the other one?
Kreacher deosn't know
about the other locket.
Yes, but did you ever see it?
It was in this house.
Flithy mudblood...bloodtraitor Weasley!
Answer her.
Yes It was here, in this house.
Most evil object.
- What do you mean?
- Before Master. Regulus died ...
... he ordered Kreacher to destroy the locket,
but no matter how hard Kreacher tried,
he could not do it.
Well, where is it now?
- Did someone take it?
- He came in the night.
He took many things
including the locket.
Who?
Who was it, Kreacher?
Mundungus.
Mundungus Fletcher.
Find him.
My father will hear about this.
Hey loosers.
He isn't here.
HARRY POTTER
UNDESIRABLE NUMBER 1 / i
As your new Minister of Magic ...
... I promise to restore this temple
of tolerance to its former glory.
MAGIC IS MIGHT / i
- Therefore beginning today ...
... each employee will submit
themselves... to evaluation
.
But know this, that you
have nothing to fear...
... if you have nothing to hide.
They have flesh memories.
When Scrimgeour first gave it to you,
I thought, that it might open at to your touch.
Dumbledore could have
hidden something inside it.
- Harry Potter!
- Zlezte of me!
Expelliarmus / i
What are you playing at?
Setting a pair of bleeding
elf on me?
Dobby was only trying to help.
Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley ...
... which Dobby thought was curious and then
Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name.
And then Dobby saw Kreacher
talking with the thief.
Me a thief ?
You foul little ...
- You're a thief, Dung, everyone knows it.
- Mr. Weasley.
- So good to see you.
- Nice shoes.
Listen.
I panicked, alright?
He was right on me and
Mad-Eye fell off his broom
- You ...
- Tell the truth.
When you turned this place over, don't deny it
You found a locket am I right?
Boy, was it valuable?
Bleeding gave it away, didn't I ?
There I was selling my goods ...
... when some Ministry hag comes up
and asks to see my license.
she says
she would lock me up?.
Would have done too if she
didn't take a fancy to that locket.
Who was it?
The witch, do you know her?
No ...
Oh ! She's there.
Look.
Its that old hag
MINISTRY SEEKS
EDUCATIONAL REFORM / i
Right
Remember what we said.
Don't speak to anybody,
Unless it is absolutely necessary.
Just ...
Try and act normal.
Do what everybody
else is doing.
Do that and with a bit of luck
we'll get inside.
- And then ...
- It gets really tricky.
Right.
- This is completely mental.
- "Completely ?"
The world is mental.
Come on.
We have a Horcrux to find.
We have to flush
ourselves in.
Its bloody Disgusting.
- Are those ...?
- Muggles.
In there ... rightful place.
Let me tell you
stop to freak out a bit.
How long did you say
this polyjuice potion will last, Hermione?
I didn't.
Cattermole.
Its still raining inside my
office. Its been two days now.
Have you tried an umbrella?
You realize i'm going downstairs
don't you, Cattermole?
- Downstairs?
- To interrogate your wife.
Now if my wife's
blood status were in doubt ...
... and the Head of Department of Magical Law Enforcement
needed a job doing ...
... I think I might just
make that a priority
You have one hour.
Oh my god,
what am I gonna do?
My wife is all alone
downstairs.
Ron, you don't have a wife.
- Oh right.
- Level 2
- How do I stop it raining
- Try Finite Incantatem. / I
This is you, Ron.
Finite Incantatem. / i
Okay.
And if it doesn't work?
I say if don't locate Umbridge within the hour,
we find Ron and come back another day.
- Deal?
- Yes.
Ah, Mafalda
Trevor sent you, did he?
Good.
We'll go straight down.
Albert, weren't you getting out?

Runcorn?
Morning.
- Ron, it's me.
- Harry!
Blimey!
I forgot what you look like.
- Where is Hermione?
- She's gone down to the court rooms, with Umbridge.
I am half blood.
My father was a wizard.
He worked there 30 years.
Perhaps you know him.
He Always wore a jacket or vice versa.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole,
- Yes.
- It's here.
Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred;
Wife to Reginald?
Regi.
Thank you, Albert.
Mary Elizabeth Cattermole.
Yes?
A wand was taken from you
upon your arrival at the Ministry Mrs Cattermole
Is this that wand?
Would you please tell the court,
from witch or wizard you took this wand ?
No one.
I bought it in Diagon Alley,
by Ollivanders, when I was 11.
It chose me.
You are lying. Wands choose only witches,
and you're not a witch.
But I am.
Tell them, Reg, tell them I am.
What on Earth are you doing, Albert?
You are lying, Dolores.
One must not tell lies.
Stupefy! / i
- It's Harry Potter!
- It is him. Its okay to tell the kids.
Expecto patronum! / i
Mary.
Go on home.
Take the kids
I'll meet you there.
We have to leave the country, do you understand?
Mary, do as I say.
Mary?
Who is that?
Long story...
Nice meeting you.
Harry Potter.
It's Harry. Harry Potter.
Harry.
Harry, quickly, in my bag.
There is a bottle labeled
Essence of Dittany. / i
Quickly!
Accio Dittany! / i
Good.
Unstopper it.
Hermione, his arm.
I know just do it!
Its gonna...
This is gonna Sting a little bit
What happened? I thought we
were going to go back to Grimmauld Place.
We were.
Alright, One more, One more
We were there we were there but,
Yaxley got a hold of me ...
... and he saw
where we went ...
... We couldn't stay there,
so I brought us here, but ...
... Ron splinched.
It's good.
Protego Totalum. / i
- Salvia Hexi. / i
- What are you doing?
Protective enchantments.
I do not want a repeat of what happened at
Shaftesbury Avenue, do you?
-Get going with a tent
- Tent?
- Protego Totalum. / i
- Where am I supposed to find a tent?
Repello Mukletum.

What are you doing?
We have to keep it safe,
until we find out how to destroy it.
Seems strange, mate.
Dumbledore sent you out to find those Horcruxes
but doesn't tell you how to destroy them
Doesn't it bother you?
You know the spell, Harry. / i
- Tell me, Gregorovitch.
- He stole it from me.
Who was it?
The thief?
The boy.
It was he who took it.
I never saw it again
I swear on my life.
I believe you.
Avada Kedavra! / i
I thought
it stopped.
You can't keep
, Harry.
- You-Know- Who found Gregorovitch.
- This Wand Maker?
He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have.
I do not know what.
But he wants it desperately.
As if his life depended on it
.
Don't, its his comfort zone.
??
It sets my teeth on edge,,
Whats he expecting to hear?? Good news?
One can only hope
not to hear bad news.
How long before he can travel?
- I'm doing everyting I can.
-You are not doing enough?
Take it off!
I said,
Take it off, now!
- Better?
- Right .
We will take in turns, okay?
What is that?
Snatchers.
Good to know,
that your enchantments work.
He could smell it.
my perfume.
I told you
Ron is not strong enough to apparate.
So we will go on foot then.
Only next time, even when I like
your perfume, do not use it.
The names of missing...
. / i
These are confirmed. / i
Oh, thank you.
He doesn't know what he is doing? does he?
None of us do.
- Oh My God !
- What?
- I'll tell you in a minute.
- You can tell me now?
Sword of Gryffindor .
Its goblin made
Brilliant.
No, you don't understand.
Dirt and dust
have no effect on the blade.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger.
Okay ...
we are looking for a way to destroy horcrux , right ?
- Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.
- With a basilisk.fang
If you tell me you got ,
one of those in that bloody beeded bag of yours ...
Don't you see? In The Chamber of Secrets
you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor
Its blade is impregnated with
basilisk venom.
It only takes in that
which makes it stronger
- Exactly, which is why
- It can destroy Horcruxes.
Thats why Dumbledore
left it to you in his will.
You're brilliant, Hermione.
Truely.
Actually, I just highly logical thinking,
which allows to me see past and irrelevant details ...
... and perceived cleary which
others overlook
Yeah, there is only one problem.
Someone stole the sword.
Hey, I'm still here.
You two carry on.
Don't let me spoil the fun.
I told you everything
that Dumbledore told me!
Incase you haven't noticed
We have found one Horcrux already.
Yes, and we are as close to getting rid
of it as we are to finding the rest, aren't we?
Ron, Please, take off the Horcrux ...
you wouldn't have spoken like this
if you hadn't wore it all day
You know, why I listen to the radio every night?
To make sure that i don't hear Ginny's name,
or Fred, or George or moms ...
You think i don't know that ?
- You think i don't know how it feels?
- You don't know how it feels!
Your parents are dead!
You have no family!
- Stop! Stop!
- Let me Go!
- Go Then
Ron ...
And you?
Are you coming or
are you staying?
Fine. I get it.
I saw you two the other night.
Ron's ...
There is nothing.
Ron!
Ron, where are you going?
Come back, now!
Salvia Hexi
I opens at the close / i
Hermione?
Hermione?
You were right.
Snithced have flesh memory ...
... but I did not catch the first snitch with my hand.
I almost swallowed it.
- "I open at the close."
- What do you think that means?
I don't know.
I found something as well
At first I thought it was an eye
it's eye, but now I don't think it is.
And it's no rune,
it is anywhere in Spellmans syllabury.
Someone wrote it there.
Somebody inked it in
it isn't part of the book
Luna's dad was wearing that at
the wedding of Bill and Fleur.
Why would someone draw
it in a childrens book?
Hermione, I've been thinking
I want to go to Godric's Hollow
Its where I was born ,
Its where my parents died.
Thats exactly why they'll expect you to go
it means something to you
But it means something to
him too, Hermione.
You-Know-Who almost died there.
Isn't that exactly the type of place
he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?
It is dangerous, Harry.
But I admit it recently I've been thinking
we have to go there
I think its is possible that
something else is hidden there.
What?
The Sword.
If Dumbledore wanted you to find it,
and to not let it fall into the hands of the Ministry ...
... what better place to hide it
than the birthplace of founder of Gryffindor
Hermione ...
Don't tell me I have to give
you a haircut again
I still think that we
should use Polyjuice Potion.
No.
This is where I was born.
I don't want to return?,
as someone else.
Harry, I think it is Christmas eve.
Listen.
Do you think they are here, Hermione?
My mom and dad.
I think so.
Ignotus Peverell.
Hey, Harry?
Merry Christmas, Hermione.
Merry Christmas, Harry.
Harry, someone is watching us.
Near the church.
I think I know who it is.
- I don't know this, Harry.
- Hermione, Dumbledore knew.
She might have the sword.
This is where they died, Hermione.
This is where he murdered them.
Bathilda, aren't you ?
Leave it, let me do that.
Miss Bagshot,
Who is this man?
Harry!
Are you feeling better?
This time can be overcome,
Hermione.
Forest of Dean.
I came here once with my mother and father.
Years ago.
Its just
how I remember it.
Trees, the river, everything.
Like nothings changed.
This of course is true,
everything has changed.
If there were my parents,
they would have nothing nepamtali.
Or trees.
Or river.
Not even me.
Perhaps we should
stay here, Harry.
Grow old?.
You wanted to know
Who was the boy in the photograph was.
I know.
Gellert Grindelwald.
He's the thief I saw
in Gregorovitch's wandshop.
Speaking of which
where's my wand?
Where's my wand, Hermione?
As we were leaving Godrics Hollow I cast a curse.
and it rebounded
I'm sorry.
I tried to mend it,
But wands are different.
Its nothing.
Lend me yours.
Go inside and get warm.
I'll take the locket as well.
Lumos. / i
Accio sword! / i
Diffindo. / i
Hermione?
Are you mental?
Ron, is that you?
Yes.
Didn't hurt yourself did you ?
- You cast the doe as well did you?
- No, I thought that was you.
- No, my Patronus is a stag.
Clear.
Okay, Ron.
Do it.
I can not. The thing affect me more
as you and Hermione.
- All the more reason
- I can not.
then why are you here?
Why did you come back?
I'll have to speak to it to open it
When it does, don't hesitate.
I don't know whats in there, but it will put up a fight?.
The bit of Riddle in the diary was trying to kill me?.
One.
Two.
Three.
and I see your heart and it is mine. / i
I see your dreams,
Ronald Weasley. / I
I see your fear. / i
hated her mother,
who longed for a daughter. / i
Not My Favorites girl? om,
wishing your friend a. / i
Ron!
we were better without you. / i
happy without you ? astnej. / i
Who would choose you .../ i
... compared to Harry Potter? / i
What are you compared to the chosen one? / i
Ron, its lying!
Your mother confessed,
she would prefer as a son. / i
What woman would take you? / i
you are .
Nothing...Nothing / I
Nothing compared to him. / i
Just think
There are only three to go.
Hermione?
Hermione?
Is everything alright?
Fine...
Actually its more than fine.
Hi.
You ...
... a complete arse of,
a Weasley!
You show up here after weeks
and you say 'hey'?
Where's my wand, Harry?
- Where is my wand?
- I don't know.
Harry Potter
You give me my wand!
-What happened to your wand?
- Nevermind he's got my wand.
What is that?
You destroyed it.
And how is it that you just happened to have the
sword of Gryffindor ?
It's a long story.
Don't think
it changes anything.
Of course not. I only destroyed a
bloody Horcrux, why will that change anything.
I wanted to come back
as soon as I left.
-just didn't know how to find you
- how did you found us ?
With this. Doesn't just
Turn out lights
I don't know how it works
but christmas morning I sleping in this little pub ...
... keeping away from some snatchers.
- When I heard it.
- What?
Voice.
Your voice, Hermione.
comin out of it.
And what exactly did I say
if I may ask??
My name.
Just my name.
like a Whisper
So I took it, clicked it ...
... this tiny ball of light appeared
And I knew.
sure enough.
Flew towards me,
ball of light.
Right into my chest.
Straight through me.
Right here
I knew that it was gonna take me
where I needed to go
so I disapparated
came to this hillside
It was dark, I had
no idea where I was.
I just hoped
One of you will show yourself
you did
I have always liked these flames
Hermione makes.
How long do you think
she will stay mad at me?
i don't know ...
just keep talking about that little ball,
and it might touch her in the heart ...
... and she will come around.
- It's true. Every word.
This is gonna sound crazy.
But I think,thats why Dubledore left it to me
The delumintor.
I think somehow he knew
I'll need to find my way back
Hey, I just realized
you need a wand, don't yout?
I got one here.
Blackthorn 10 inches ,
nothing special.
- But be uploaded with just. - I took off
a snatcher few weeks ago
Don't tell hermione this
Definitely was a troll,
by the smell of it.
Engorgio. / i
Finite / i
We need to talk.
Yeah, alright
I want to go see
Xenophilius Lovegood.
Sorry?
See this ? It is a letter
Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald.
Look at the signature.
It's the mark again
It keeps cropping up.
in The tales of Beedle the Bard,
in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow ...
it was there too.
- Where?
- Outside Gregorvitch's wandshop.
- What dors it mean?
- Look...
You have no idea where the next Horcrux is
, and neither I do
But this,
this means something.
- I am sure of it.
- Yeah. Hermione's right.
We ought to see Lovegood
Lets vote.
Those in favor.
are you still mad at him?
I am always mad at him
KEEP OFF THE
DIRIGIBLE PLUMS / i
Do not touch
Dirigible Plums.
What is it?
Who are you?
What do you want?
Hello, Mr. Lovegood.
I'm Harry Potter,
we met a few months ago.
Can we come in?
Where is Luna?
I don't know.
She will be along.
So...how can I
help you, Mr Potter ?
Well, actually ...
... it was about something that you were wearing
around your neck at the wedding. A symbol.
- You mean this?
- Yes.
That's it exactly
What I wonder is ...
what is it?
What is it?
Well.. its the sign of
the deathly hallows ofcourse .
- The What?
- The What?
The Deathly Hallows. I assume you are all
familiar with the tale of the three brothers?
- Yes.
- No.
I have it in here.
There were once three brothers,
who were travelling along a lonely
winding road ...
... at twilight
- Midnight.
Mom always said midnight.
Twilight is fine.
better actually.
There were once three brothers,
who were travelling along a lonely
winding road ...
... at twilight.
In time the brothers reached a
river too treacherous to pass
But they were learned in the magical arts
the three brothers simply waved their wands..
... and made a bridge.
Before they could cross however they
found their path blocked by a hooded figure.
It was Death
And he felt cheated
Cheated, because travelers
usually drowned in the river.
But Death was cunning.
he pretended to congratulate
the three brothers .on their magic..
... and said,
that each had earned a prize ...
... for being clever enough
to evade him
the oldest asked for a wand,
more powerful than any in existence
so death fashioned him a wand
from the elder tree that stood nearby
The second brother he decided
he wanted to humiliate death
even further..
... and asked for the power
to recall loved ones from
their graves
So Death picked a stone from the river
and offered it to him.
Finally, Death turned to
the third brother.
A humble man, asked for something
that allowed him to go from that place...
...without being followed
by death
And so it was that death reluctantly
handed over his own cloak of
invisibility
The first brother travelled
to a distant village...
... with the elder wand in his hand
he killed a wizard with whom he once had quarrels..
Drunk with the power that
the elder wand had given him..
... he bragged about it
You shall not prevail against his nose? ou.
But that night ...
...another wizard stole the wand
and slit the brothers throat for good measure.
And so the death took the first brother.
for his own
The second brother journeyed home,
where he took the stone and
turned it thrice in his hand
To his delight the girl he once
wanted to marry before her untimely death...
... appeared before him.
But soon she turned sad and cold
because she did not belong to the mortal world
Driven mad with hopeless longing
the second brother killed himself
so as to join her
And so death took the second brother
As for the third brother Death
searched for many years
but was never able to find him
only when he had attained a great age the
youngest brother shed the cloak of invisibilty
and gave it to his son ...
.. he then greeted death
as a old friend
and went with him gladly
departing this life as equals
so there we are
Those are the Deathly Hallows.
I'm sorry sir,
I still don't quite understand.
The Elder wand ...
... the most powerful wand
ever made.
The resurrection stone
The cloak of invisibility
Together, they make the Deathly Hallows.
Together they make one
master of death.
That mark was on the grave in
Godrics Hollow.
Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell
family have something to do with
the deathly hallows
Yes, Ignotus, and his brothers
Cadmus and Antioch were the original owner of the hallows ...
... and therefore inspiration for the story.
Your tea has gone cold
Don't go
I'll be right back?.
Let's get out of here .
I have more of this brndy pi? I will not.
- Thank you for ...
- You forgot the water.
- Water ?
- In the tea.
How silly of me.
You do not have to,
we should be going any way.
No, you do not!
Sir?
You are my only hope.
They were angry, you see,
because of what I've been writing.
so they took ...
... took my children.
my children
??
Who took her, sir?
Voldemort.
I got it!
treacherous little bleeder!
is there no one we can trust?
they kidnapped her
because he supported me.
He was just desperate.
I'll do the enchantments.
Hello beautiful.
Don;t just hang back
Snatch them
Harry.
Tell me. what to do Tell me, where it is. / I
Grindelwald.
Grindelwald.
-??
-??
I knew
that one day you come.
But surely as you know.
i no longer have what you seek.
I believe you Grindelwald,
tell me where it is
Tell me who posseses it.
The elder wand lies with him
ofcourse....
Buried in the earth.
with Dumbledore.
The hallows exist
He is only after one... the last one
He knows where it is.
he's gonna have it by the end of the night?.
you know who's had the elder wand.
Do not touch her!
Your boyfriend will get much worse for that
if he doesn't learn to behave himself
And what happened to you, ugly?
No, not you.
- What is your name?
- Dudley. Vernon Dudley.
Check it.
And you him and ugly, lovely?
What do they call you?
Penelope Clearwater
Half blood
There is no Vernon Dudley on here.
You hear that ugly?
This means you're lying to us.
- Why did not you tell us? Who you are?
- Do you have a mistake, I already told you who I am.
Change of plan.
We are not taking this lot to the Ministry.
Get Draco.
Well?
I can't be sure.
Look closely, son.
If we are the ones who
hand Potter to the Dark Lord....
... everything would be forgiven,
it would all be as it was understood ?
Now we won't be forgetting
who really caught him ...
...I hope Mr Malfoy.
- Don't dare to talk to me like that in my own house
- Lucius!
Do not be shy, come closer!
If this isn't who you
think it is Draco ...
... and we will call Him,
He'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure!
- Whats wrong with his face?
- Yes, what it wrong with his face?
We captured him like that.
Something he captured in the forrest I reckom
That happens during a stinging jinx
Was it you
Give me your wand, let's see
what your last spell was
And I? A.
Whats that?
Where did you get that from?
It was in her bag when we searched her
I reckon its mine now.
Are you mad?
Get out!...Get out!
Cissy ...
... hold those boys in the basement!
I'd like a conversation with this one...
... girl to girl!
What are we gonna do??
We can't leave Hermione alone with her!
Ron?
Harry?
Luna?
The Sword is meant to be in my vault
How did you get it?
- Did you and your friend STEAL FROM MY VAULT?
-
I didn't take anything.
I do not believe you.
- We have to do something?!
- There is no way out of here.
We tried everything.
It's enchanted
You are Bleeding Harry, its a curious thing to
keep on yourself
Help us!
- Let her go
- Get Back!
You Goblin, come with me.
Dobby?
What are you doing here?
Dobby has come to rescue
Harry Potter!
Dobby will alwyas be
there for Harry Potter.
You say that you can apparate
out of this room ?
- Can you take us with you
- Of course, I'm a elf
No clear.
Well, Dobby, take Luna
and Mr. Ollivander, please.
Take them to shell cottage
its near the sea.
Trust me.
When you're ready, sir.
Sir?
I like her very much!
Meet me at top of the
stairs in ten seconds.
Who gets his wand?
So once again, goblin
Think it very very carefully.
- How to get there?
- I do not know!
You don't know?
Please try again.
Who got into my vault?
Who stole it?
Who stole it?
Impossible to break into Gringotts
the sword is there.
Mudblood / i
How did it get here then?
Nowhere is safer,
than in Gringotts bank.
Consider yourself lucky goblin
- This does not apply to her.
- You only think!
Expelliarmus / i
Stupefy! / i
Stop!
Drop your wands.
I said, drop them!
Pick em up, Draco, now!
Well well well ...
Look who we have here.
Its Harry Potter.
Whole bright shiny and new
Just in time for the Dark Lord.
Call him.
Call him
Stupefy! / i
Stupid elf!
You could have kill me?!
Dobby never meant to kill .
Dobby only meant to maim or
seriously injure
How dare you take a
witch's wand?
How dare you
defy your masters?
Dobby has no master!
Dobby is a free elf...
... and Dobby has come to save
Harry Potter and his friends
Hermione!
Are you alright?
We are safe.
We are all safe.
Harry Potter ...
Dobby!
That would be fine ...
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on, yes?
We are going to fix it.
Hermione, the dittany ...
... in your purse!
Hermione!
Hermione!
Help me!
It's so beautiful than alone...
... with you here as friends.
Dobby is Happy ...
... that may be
with his friend ...
... Harry Potter.
We should close his eyes ...
... don't you think
There
Now he could be sleeping.
I want to bury him...
...Properly, without magic.


#####8

It's beautiful here.
It was our aunt's.
We used to come here as kids.
The Order uses it now as a safe house.
What's left of us atleast.
Muggles think these
things keep evil away.
But they're wrong.
I need to talk to the Goblin.
How are you?
- You buried the elf?
- Yes.
And brought me here.
You are...
Pretty unusual, is it?
How did you come by the sword?
It's complicated.
Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think
that it should be in her vault at Gringotts?
It's complicated.
The sword presented itself to us,
in moment of need.
We didn't steal it.
There is a sword in Madam Lestrange's vault
identical to this one.
But it is a fake.
It was placed there this past summer.
And she never suspected it was a fake.
The replica is very convincing.
Only a goblin would recognize that this is the true Sword of Gryffindor.
Who is the acquaintance?
A Hogwarts Professor.
As I understand that he's now Headmaster.
Snape.
He put a fake sword in Bellatrix's vault.
Why?
There are more than a fewcurious things
in the vaults at Gringotts.
And in Madam Lestrange's vault as well?
Perhaps.
I need to get into Gringotts.
Into one of the vaults.
- It is impossible.
- Alone, yes.
But with you, no.
- Why should I help you?
- I have gold.
Lots of....
I've no interest in gold.
Then what?
That.
That is my price.
Are you thinking there's a Horcrux in Bellatrix's vault?
Well, she was terrified when she thought we had been in there.
She kept asking you,
what else was taken?
I bet you anything, there's Horcrux in there.
Another piece of his soul.
Let's find it, kill it, and we are
one step closer to killing him.
And what happens when we find it,
How're we supposed to destroy it, now you're giving the sword to Griphook?
I'm still working on that part.
He's weak.
Who?
Mr. Ollivander
I need to ask you a few questions.
Anything, m'boy.
Anything!
Would you mind identifying this wand?
We need to know if it's safe to use.
Uhh... Walnut
Dragon Heartstring
Unyie...
Unyielding.
This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.
Treat it carefully.
And this?
Hawthorn.
An unicorn hair.
Reasonably pliant.
This was the wand of Draco Malfoy.
Was?
Is it not still?
Well, perhaps not.
If you won it from him.
I sense its allegiance has changed.
You talk about wands,
as if they have feelings...
.......can think!
The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
That much has always been clear to
those of us who've studied wandlore.
And, what do you know about the Deathly Hallows?
It is rumored there are three.
The Elder Wand, the Cloak of Invisibility,
to hide you from your enemies...
and the Resurrection Stone, to bring
back loved ones from the dead.
Together, they make one the Master of Death.
But, few truly believe that such objects exist.
Do you?
Do you believe they exist, sir?
Well...
I see no reasons to put
stock into an old wives' tale.
You're lying!
You know one exists.
You told him about it.
You told him about the Elder Wand...
and where he could go looking for it.
He tortured me.
Besides...
....I only conveyed rumors.
There's...
There's no telling whether he will find it.
He has found it, sir.
We'll let you rest.
He's after you, Mr. Potter.
If it's true what you say,
that he has the Elder Wand,
I'm afraid,
...you really don't stand a chance.
Well, I am supposed to kill him, before he finds me, then.
You're sure that's hers?
Positive.
Well?
How do I look?
Hideous.
You can give that to Hermione to hold.
Alright, Griphook?
We're relying on you, Griphook.
If you get us past the guards into the vault...
The sword's yours.
Madam Lestrange.
Good morning.
Good morning?
Good morning?
You're Bellatrix Lestrange,
not a school girl!
Hey!
Easy!
If she gives us away, we must swear
to use that sword to slit our own throats.
Understand?
No, he's right.
I speak stupid.
Okay.
Let's do it.
I wish to enter my vault.
Identification?
I hardly think that would be necessary.
Madam Lestrange.
I don't like to be kept waiting.
I know...
They know she's an impostor.
They'd be warned.
Harry...
What do we do, Harry?
Madam Lestrange,
would you mind presenting your wand?
And why should I do that?
It's the bank's policy!
I'm sure you understand, given current climate.
No! I most certainly do not understand!
I'm afraid, I must insist.
Imperio!
Very well, Madam Lestrange.
If you would follow me?
What is that, Griphook?
Griphook!
Aresto Momentum
Well done, Hermione.
Oh no, you two're like you again.
The Thief's Downfall,
washes away all enchantment.
Can be deadly.
You don't say.
Just out of interest,
is there any other way outta here?
No.
What the devil are all you doing down here?
Thieves!
You gave up the.....
-Imperio
-You!
That doesn't sound good.
Bloody hell!
It's an Ukrainian Ironbelly.
Here.
It's been trained to expect pain
when it hears this noise.
That's barbaric!
Lumos.
Blimey!
Accio Horcrux!
You seem you're gonna try
this here, won't you?
No kind of magic would work in here.
It's in here, Harry?
Can you feel anything?
That's it!
Up there!
They have added the Gemino curse.
Everything you touch will multiply.
Give me the sword.
Stop moving!
Do it!
- We had deal, Griphook!
- The cup for the sword!
I said I'll get you in,
I didn't say anything about getting you out.
Griphook! Thieves!
Griphook!
Hey, thieves!
Is that okay?
We've still got Bogrod.
That's unfortunate.
We can't just stand here,
You got any idea?
Should be a brilliant one.
I've got something,
but it's mad!
Reducto
Well, come on, then!
Relashio
Keep moving!
Now what?
Reducto
Hold on.
That was brilliant!
Absolutely brilliant!
We're dropping!
- I say we jump!
- When?
Now!
He knows.
You-Know-Who.
He knows we broke into Gringotts.
He knows what we took,
and he knows we're hunting Horcruxes.
- How did he know?
- I saw him.
You let him in?
Harry, you can't do that!
Hermione, I can't always help it!
Well, maybe I can.
I don't know!
Never mind!
What happened?
Well, he's angry...
and scared too.
He knows, if we find and destroy
all the Horcruxes, we'll be able to kill him.
I reckon he'll stop at nothing
to make sure we don't find the rest.
And there's more.
One of them is at Hogwarts.
What?
You saw it?
I saw the castle.
And Rowena Ravenclaw.
It must have something to do with her.
We have to go there, now!
Well, we can't do that!
We've got to plan,
we've got to figure it out!
Hermione, when have any of
our plans ever actually worked?
We plan, we get there,
all hell breaks loose.
He's right!
One problem...
Snape's Headmaster now,
we can't just move freely from the front door!
Well, we'll go to Hogsmeade,
to Honeydukes.
Take the secret passage in the cellar.
It's...
There's something wrong with him.
It's like, you know,
in the past...
I've always been able
to follow his thoughts.
And now everything just feels disconnected.
Maybe it's the Horcruxes.
Maybe he's getting weaker.
Maybe he's dying!
No!
No, it's.. it's more like he's wounded.
If anything, he feels more dangerous.
- Right here. Come on!
- Search everywhere.
Go, move!
Faster!
In here, Potter.
Come on, move!
Did you look at him.
- For a second I thought that was...
- I know. Dumbledore!
Harry?
I can see you in this.
Bloody fools, what are you thinking coming here?
Have you any idea how dangerous it is?
You're Aberforth, Dumbledore's brother.
It's you who I've been seeing in here.
You're the one who sent Dobby.
- Why've you left him?
- He's dead.
Sorry to hear it.
I liked that elf.
Who gave that to you?
The mirror?
Mundungus Fletcher, about a year ago.
Dung had no right selling that to you.
It belongs to...
Sirius...
Albus told me.
He also told me you'd likely be hacked off,
...if you ever found that I had it.
But, ask yourself;
Where would you be if I didn't?
Do you have any others much?
From the Order?
The Order has finished.
You-Know-Who has won,
...anyone who says otherwise
is killing themselves.
We need to get into Hogwarts, tonight.
Dumbledore gave us a job to do.
Did he now...
Nice job?
Easy?
We've been hunting Horcruxes.
We think the last one's inside the castle.
But we'll need your help getting in.
Which job my brother has given you, it's a suicide mission.
Do yourself a favor, boy.
Go home!
Live a little longer.
Dumbledore trusted me to see this through.
What makes you think you can trust him?
What makes you think you can
believe anything my brother told you?
And in all the time you knew him...
Did he ever mention my name?
Did he ever mentioned hers?
- Why should he...
- Keep secrets.
You tell me?
- I trusted him.
- That's the boy's answer.
A boy goes chasing Horcruxes is on the word of
a man who wouldn't even tell him where to start.
You're lying!
Not just on me, it doesn't matter.
To yourself as well.
That's what a fool does.
You don't strike me as a fool, Harry Potter!
So, I ask you again, there must be a reason.
I'm not interested in what happened
between you and your brother.
I don't care that you've given up.
I trusted the man I knew.
We need to get into the castle tonight.
You know what to do.
Where have you sent her?
You'll see.
Soon enough.
That's your sister, Ariana.
Isn't it?
She died very young, didn't she?
My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter.
On his journey to find power.
Including Ariana.
And she was devoted to him.
He gave her everything.
But time.
Thank you, Mr. Dumbledore.
He did save our lives twice!
Kept an eye on us on that mirror.
That doesn't seem like someone who's given up!
She's coming back.
What's that with her?
Neville!
- How you look...
- Like hell, I reckon.
But this is nothing.
Seamus is worse.
Hey, Ab!
We've got a couple more coming through.
Don't remember this on the Marauder's Map.
That's because it never existed till now.
The seven secret passages were sealed off,
before the start of the year.
This is the only way in or out, now.
The grounds are crawled with Death Eaters and Dementors.
How about Mr.Snape as Headmaster?
Hardly ever seen.
It's the Carrows who's watching out for.
Carrows?
Yeah. Brother and sister.
Incharge of discipline.
They like punishment, the Carrows.
They did that to you?
Why?
Today's Dark Arts lesson was
practicing the Cruciatus curse.
On first years.
I refused.
Hogwarts has changed.
Let's have a bit of fun, shall we?
Hey, you lots! It's
for your surprise.
No more about Aberforth's cook's gonna help.
We'll be surprised if it's just digested.
- Oh my!
- Harry!
Get the word out to Remus and the others, that Harry is back.
Okay, okay!
Let's not kill him before You-Know-Who does.
...Do you read? we've a new weather report.
Lightning has struck. I repeat: Lightning has struck.
What's the fun, Harry?
Okay.
There's something we need to find.
There's something hidden here, in the castle.
And it may help us to defeat
You-Know-Who.
- Alright, what is it?
- We don't know.
- Where is it?
- We don't know that either.
I realize that's not much to go on.
That's nothing to go on.
I think it has something to do with Ravenclaw.
It'll be small, easily concealed.
Anyone, any ideas?
Well, there's Rowena Ravenclaw's lost diadem.
Oh, bloody hell!
Here we go!
Lost diadem of Ravenclaw?
Hasn't anyone heard of it?
It's quite famous.
Yes. But, Luna, it's lost.
For centuries.
There's no person alive today who's seen it.
Excuse me, can someone tell me what bloody diadem is?
It's a sort of crown.
You know, like a tiara.
Harry!
Hi, there.
Six months she hasn't seen me and
it's like I'm a frankie first-year.
I'm her brother!
- She got lots of them, but she has got only one Harry.
- Shut up, Seamus!
What is it, Ginny?
Snape knows... he knows
that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade.
Many of you are surely wondering,
why I have summoned you at this hour.
It's come to my attention,
that earlier this evening...
Harry Potter was sighted in Hogsmeade.
Now...
should anyone...
student or staff attempt to aid Mr. Potter?
They will be punished in a manner consistent with
the severity of their transcription, further more...
Any person found have
knowledge of these events...
who fails to come forward...
will be treated as equally guilty.
Another...
If anyone in here has any knowledge of
Mr. Potter's movements this evening.
I invite them to step forward.
Now!
It seems, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies,
...you still have a security problem, Headmaster.
I'm afraid it's quite extensive.
How dare you stand where he stood?
Tell them how it happened that night?
Tell them how you looked him in the eye...
A man who trusted you, and killed him.
Tell them!
COWARD!!!
Harry.
Potter?
I know that many of you will want to fight.
Some of you might even think to fight is wise.
But this is folly.
Give me Harry Potter.
Do this and none shall be harmed.
Give me Harry Potter,
and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched.
Give me Harry Potter,
and you will be rewarded.
You have one hour.
What're you waiting for?
Someone grab him!
Students out of bed!
Students in the corridor!
They're supposed to be out of bed,
you blithering idiot!
Sorry ma'am.
As it happens, Mr. Filch...
Your arrival is most opportune.
If you would, I wouldd like you please, to lead Miss Parkinson
and the rest of Slytherin house, from the hall.
Exactly where is it I'll be leading 'em to, ma'am?
The dungeons would do.
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter.
What is it you need?
Time, Professor.
As much as you can get me.
Do what you have to do.
I'll secure the castle.
Potter...
It's good to see you.
It's good to see you too, Professor.
Hold the fort, Neville.
Harry!
Hermione and I were thinking,
it doesn't matter if we find the Horcrux.
What do you mean?
Unless we can destroy it.
So, we were thinking...
Well, Ron was thinking, it was Ron's idea.
It was completely brilliant
You destroyed Tom Riddle's diary
with a Basilisk fang, right?
Well, me and Hermione did remind
where we might find one.
Okay.
Okay, but take this.
That way, you can find me when you get back.
Where're you going?
Ravenclaw common room,
Gotta start somewhere.
Harry!
Harry!
Let me get this straight, Professor...
You're actually giving us
permission to do this?
That is correct, Longbottom.
That's blowing up!
Boom!
Boom!
Wicked!
But how on earth are we gonna do that?
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?
As I recall, he has a particular
proclivity for pyro-technics.
I can bring it down.
That's the spirit!
Well, you go.
You do realize, of course, we can't
keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.
That doesn't mean
we can't delay him.
And his name is Voldemort.
Filius, you might as well use it.
He's come to try to kill you, either way!
Piertotum Locomotor.
Hogwarts is threatened.
Man the boundaries! Protect us.
Do your duty...
....to our school.
I always wanted to use that spell!
Protego Maxima
Fianto Duri
Repello Inimigotum
Protego Maxima
Fianto Duri
Repello....
Protego Maxima
Fianto Duri
Repello Inimigotum
Protego Maxima
Harry, wait!
I need to talk to you!
- I'm a bit pre-occupied at the moment, Luna.
- You don't know where you're going.
You're wasting your time!
Look, we'll talk later, okay?
- Harry?
- Later.
Harry Potter, you listen to me right now!
Do you remember what Cho said
about Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem?
There is not a person alive who's seen it.
It's obvious, isn't it?
We have to talk to someone who's dead.
It's very impressive, isn't it?
If you want to find her,
you'll find her down there.
- Aren't you coming?
- No.
I think it's best if you two talk alone.
She's very shy.
You're the Grey Lady.
The ghost of Ravenclaw tower.
I do not answer to that name!
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
It's Helena, isn't it?
Helena Ravenclaw,
Rowena's daughter.
Are you a friend of Luna's?
Yes.
And she thought you might be able to help me.
You seek my mother's diadem?
Yes.
That's right.
Luna is kind.
Unlike so many of the others.
But she was wrong,
I cannot help you!
Wait, please!
I want to destroy it!
They never learn.
Such a pity.
My Lord...
Shouldn't we wait?
Begin!
I thought you want to do it.
Isn't it, Helena?
You want it destroyed?
Another promised
to destroy it many years ago.
A strange boy with a strange name?
Tom Riddle.
But he lied.
He lied to many people.
I know what he's done!
I know who he is!
He defiled it, with dark magic!
I can destroy it.
Once and for all.
But only if you tell me
where he hid it?
You do know where he hid it?
Don't you, Helena?
You just have to tell me.
Please!
Strange!
You remind me of him a bit.
It's here, in the castle.
In the place where everything is hidden.
If you have to ask...
....you will never know.
If you know...
...you need only ask.
Thank you!
Tell Professor McGonagall.
Remus and I will handle this side of the castle.
Yes, sir!
Hey Dean, with second thoughts, tell Professor McGonagall we
might need one or two more wands this side.
It is the quality of one's convictions that determines one's success..
...not the number of followers.
Who said that?
Me.
You okay, Freddie?
Yeah.
Me too.
Harry talks this in sleep.
You know it?
No, of course, not!
Yeah?
You-Know-Who's army?
You do it.
I can't.
Yes, you can!
Neville!
That went well.
Get inside!
Stupefy
Ginny, Neville!
You alright?
Never better!
I feel like I can spit fire!
Have you seen Luna up there?
Luna?
I'm mad for her. I think its about time I told her
since well probably both be dead by dawn.
I know.
Bloody hell!
We'll never find him on this.
Here he is!
- He's just...
- Brilliant!
He just vanished.
I'm sure I saw it.
Maybe he's gone to the Room of Requirement.
It doesn't show up on the map, does it?
You said that last year.
That's right, I did.
Let's go.
Brilliant!
Come on!
Well, well...
What brings you here, Potter?
I could ask you the same.
You have something that's mine.
I'd like it back.
What's wrong with the wand you have?
It's my mother's.
It's powerful, but it's...
..not the same.
Doesn't quite understand me.
You know what I mean?
Why didn't you tell her?
Bellatrix?
You knew it was me.
You didn't say anything.
Come on, Draco!
Don't be a prat.
Do it!
Easy!
Expelliarmus
Avada Kedavra
Stupefy
This is my girlfriend,
you bloody gits!
Got it!
They've set the bloody place on fire!
Come on!
This way!
We can't leave them!
He's joking, right?
If we die for them,
Harry, I'm gonna kill you!
Harry!
My Lord?
Avada Kedavra!
Come Nagini, I need to keep you safe.
It's the snake.
She's the last one.
It's the last Horcrux.
Look inside him, Harry.
Find out where he is,
if you find him, we can find the snake.
And we can end this!
My Lord...
Might it be less...
I should not be more prudent to call off this attack.
Simply seek the boy.
Yourself.
I do not need to seek the boy...
....before the night is out, he will come to me!
Do you understand?
Look at me!
How can you live with yourself, Lucius?
I don't know.
Go and find Severus.
Bring him to me.
I know where he is.
Come on!
No!
You have performed extra-ordinary magic
with this wand, My Lord,
in the last few hours alone.
No!
No! I am extra-ordinary.
But the wand resists me .
There is no wand more powerful.
Ollivander himself has said it.
Tonight, when the boy comes.
It will not fail you, I am sure ...
It answers to you,
and you only.
Does it?
My Lord?
The wand, does it truly
answer to me?
You're a clever man, Severus.
Surely you must know...
- Where does its true loyalty lie?
- With you...
Of course, My Lord.
The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly,
because I am not its true master.
The Elder Wand belongs to the
wizard who killed its last owner.
You killed Dumbledore, Severus.
While you live, the Elder
Wand cannot truly be mine.
You've been a good and faithful servant, Severus.
But only I can live forever.
My Lord...
Nagini, kill!
Take it...
Take it up, please!
Give me something!
Quickly, a flask. Anything!
Take them to the Pensieve.
Look at me...
You really have your mother's eyes.
You've fought valiantly,
but in vain...
I do not wish this. Every drop of magical blood
spilled is a terrible waste.
I therefore command my forces to retreat...
In their absence,
dispose your dead with dignity,
Harry Potter, I now speak directly to you.
On this night, you have allowed your friends to die
for you, rather than face me yourself.
There is no greater dishonor.
Join me in the Forbidden Forrest...
...and confront your fate.
If you do not do this, I shall kill every last man,
woman and child who tries to conceal you from me.
Where's everybody?
Harry?
Oh, come on!
Don't be sad on it, she's passed.
There, she's gone.
Freak! Come here! I'm gonna tell mommy!
You're freak!
You're freak, Lily!
Come here!
She's jealous.
She's ordinary and you're special.
That's not true, Severus.
Gryffindor!
- Hi, I'm James.
- Hi, I'm Lily.
Just like your father.
Don't say a word against my father!
Masters shall be reunited once more!
Severus.
Don't kill me!
The prophecy did not refer to a woman.
It spoke about a boy born at the end of the July.
Yes, but it's her son!
He intends to hunt them down and kill them.
Hide him... hide them all.
I beg you!
What would you give me in exchange, Severus?
- Anything.
- Harry...
Harry, you were so loved.
So loved!
Harry, mama loves you.
Dadda loves you.
Harry, be safe.
Be strong.
Avada Kedavra!
You said you would keep her safe.
Lily and James...
put their faith in the wrong person, Severus.
Rather like you.
The boy survives.
He doesn't need protection,
the Dark Lord has gone.
The Dark Lord will return.
And when he does, the boy
will be in terrible danger!
He has her eyes.
If you truly loved her...
No one, can know.
I shall never reveal the best of you,
Severus.
Your word?
Can you risk your life every day
to protect the boy?
... He possesses no measurable talent, his arrogance rivals that of his father's and he seems to relish in his fame...
Don't tell a word against my father!
James Potter, lazy, arrogant.
- My father was a great man!
- Your father was a swine!
Drink it, it will contain the curse to
your hand, for the time being.
- It will spread, Albus.
- How long?
Maybe a year.
Don't ignore me, Severus.
We both know Lord Voldemort has ordered
the Malfoy boy to murder me.
But should he fail, I should presume
the Dark Lord will turn to you.
You must be the one to kill me, Severus.
It is the only way.
Only then, will the Dark Lord trust you completely.
There will come a time, when Harry Potter,
must be told something.
But you must wait, until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable.
Must be told what?
On the night Lord Voldemort went
to Godric's Hollow to kill Harry...
Then, Lily Potter cast herself between them...
...the curse rebounded.
When that happens, a part of Voldemort's soul...
latched itself onto the only living thing it could find...
Harry himself.
There's a reason Harry can speak with snakes...
There's a reason he can look into Lord Voldemort's mind...
A part of Voldemort lives inside him.
So, when the time comes...
...the boy must die?
Yes... yes.
He must die.
You've kept him alive, so he can
die at the proper moment?
You've been raising him like a pig for slaughter.
Don't tell me now, that you've
grown to care for the boy.
Expecto Patronum
Lily!
After all this time!
Always.
So, when the time comes...
...the boy must die?
Yes.
He must die.
And Voldemort himself must do it.
That is essential.
- Where've you been?
- I thought you went to the forest.
I'm going there now.
Are you mad?
No...
You can't give yourself up to him.
What is it, Harry?
What is it you know?
There is a reason I can hear them.
The Horcruxes.
I think I've known for a while.
And I think you have, too.
- I'll go with you.
- No, kill the snake.
Kill the snake, and it's just him!
I'm ready to die.
Resurrection Stone.
You've been so brave, sweetheart.
Why are you here?
All of you.
We never left.
Does...
Does it hurt?
Dying?
Quicker than falling asleep.
You're nearly there, son.
I'm sorry.
I never wanted any of you to die for me.
And, Remus, your son?
Others will tell him what his
mother and father died for.
One day, he'll understand.
You'll stay with me?
Until the end.
And he won't be able to see you?
No.
We're here, you see.
Stay close to me.
Always.
No sign of him, My Lord.
I thought he'd come.
Harry, no!
- What're yeh doin' 'ere?
- Quiet!
Harry Potter...
...The Boy Who Lived...
...come to die.
Avada Kedavra
You can't help...
Harry, you're a wonderful boy...
You brave, brave man!
Let us walk.
Professor, what is that?
Something beyond either of our help.
A part of Voldemort sent here to die.
And exactly where are we?
I was gonna ask you that.
Where would you say where we are?
Well, it looks like King's Cross station.
Only cleaner...
....and without all the trains.
King's Cross, is that right?
This is as they say, 'your' party.
I expect you now realize that you and Voldemort...
...have been connected by something other than fate.
Since that night at Godric's Hollow all those years ago.
So it's true then, sir.
A part of him lives within me, doesn't it?
Did.
It's been just destroyed many moments
ago by none other than Voldemort himself.
You, were the Horcrux he
never meant to make, Harry.
- I have to go back, haven't I?
- Oh, that's up to you.
- I've a choice?
- Oh, yeah!
We're in King's Cross, you say.
I think if so decide,
you'll be able to board a train.
And where will it take me?
On.
Voldemort has the Elder Wand?
True.
And the snake is still alive?
Yes.
And I've nothing to kill it with?
Help will always be given at Hogwarts, Harry.
To those who ask for it.
I've always pride of myself
on my ability to turn a phrase.
Words are, in my not so humble opinion...
..almost inexhaustible source of magic.
Capable of inflicting
injury and remedies.
But I would in this case...
amend my original statement to this:
Help, will always be given at Hogwarts,
To those who deserve it.
Do not pity the dead, Harry...
Pity the living.
And above all...
....all those who live without love.
Professor, my mother's Patronus...
was a doe, wasn't it?
As the same as Professor Snape's.
It's curious, don't you think?
Actually, if I think about it...
...it doesn't seem curious at all!
I'll be going now, Harry.
Professor?
Is this all real?
Or is it just happening inside my head?
Of course it's happening
inside your head, Harry.
Why should that mean, that it's not real?
Professor?
What should I do?
Professor!
My Lord, My Lord...
Are you hurt?
I don't need your help.
The boy...
Is he dead?
Is he alive?
Draco, is he alive?
Dead.
Who is that?
Hagrid's carrying?
Neville, who is it?
Harry Potter...
... is dead!
- No!
No!
Silence!
Stupid girl!
Harry Potter...
is dead!
From this day forth...
...you'll put your faith in me.
Harry Potter is dead!
And now it's the time to declare yourself.
Come forward and join us...
or die!
Draco!
Draco.
Draco.
Come.
Well done, Draco.
Well done!
Well, I must say I'd hope for better.
And who might you be, young man?
Neville Longbottom.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we can
find a place for you in our rank.
I'd like to say something.
Well, Neville, I'm sure we'd all be
fascinated to hear what you have to say.
- Doesn't matter that Harry is gone.
- Stand down, Neville!
People die everyday!
Friends, family.
Yeah...
We lost Harry tonight.
He's still with us.
In here.
So as Fred, Remus...
Tonks...
All of them.
They didn't die in vain.
But you will.
Because you're wrong!
Harry's heart did beat for us.
For all of us!
It's not over!
Confringo
Come on!
All remain into the castle.
We have to kill the snake.
Hey, Neville!
Not my daughter, you bitch!
Hey, you were right...
...when you told Professor Snape
that wand was failing you.
It was always fail...
I killed Snape!
Yeah, but what if the wand never belonged to Snape?
What if its allegiance has always been
with someone else?
Oh, come on, Tom...
Let's finish it the way we started.
Together!
Die!
Harry!
Why didn't it work for him?
The Elder Wand?
It answers to somebody else.
When he killed Snape, he thought
the wand would become his.
But the thing is...
The wand never belongs to Snape.
It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore
that night in the Astronomy tower.
From that moment on, the wand answered him.
Until, the other night when I disarmed Draco.
At Malfoy Manor.
So, that means...
It's mine!
- What should we do with it?
- We?
Just saying, that's the Elder Wand.
The most powerful wand in the world.
With that, he'll be invincible.
Together.
- Bag?
- Yeah
Jumper?
I'm gonna miss you.
Here they come.
Dad?
What if I am put in Slytherin?
Albus Severus Potter.
You're named after two Headmasters of Hogwarts.
One of them was a Slytherin.
And he was the bravest man I've ever known.
- What you say if I am...
- Then Slytherin house...
will've gained a wonderful young wizard.
Listen...
If it really means that much to you,
you can choose Gryffindor.
The Sorting Hat takes
your choice into account.
- Really?
- Really.
- Ready?
- Ready.
