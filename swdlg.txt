A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main title, followed by a roll-up, which crawls up into infinity.

STAR WARS

Episode I

The PHANTOM MENACE

          Turmoil has engulfed the 
          Galactic Republic. The taxation 
          of trade routes to outlaying star
          systems is in dispute.

          Hoping to resolve the matter
          with a blockade of deadly
          battleships, the greedy Trade
          Federation has stopped all 
          shipping to the small planet
          of Naboo.

          While the congress of the 
          Republic endlessly debates 
          this alarming chain of events,
          the Supreme Chancellor has
          secretly dispatched two Jedi
          Knights, the guardians of 
          peace and justice in the 
          galaxy, to settle the conflict....

PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA at great speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads toward the beautiful green planet of Naboo, which is surrounded by hundreds of Trade Federation battleships.

INT REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT

In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver closer to one of the battleships.

QUI-GON: (off screen voice) 
Captain.

The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.

CAPTAIN: 
Yes, sir?

QUI-GON: (V.O) 
Tell them we wish to board at once.

The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a Neimoidian trade viceroy, waits for a reply.

CAPTAIN: 
With all due respect, the Ambassadors for the Supreme Chancellor wish to board immediately.

NUTE: 
Yes, of course... as you know, our blockade is perfectly legal, and we'd be happy to receive the Ambassadors.

The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister battleship looms ever closer.

EXT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)

The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of the Federation battleship.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE

A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking bay.

The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the docking bay. Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.

TC-14: 
I'm TC-14 at your service. This way, please.

They move off down the hallway.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST CAMERA into the formal conference room by TC-14.

TC-14: 
We are greatly honored by your visit Ambassadors. Make yourselves comfortable. My master will be with you shortly.

The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI-GON JINN. She backs out the door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods and look out a large window at the lush green planet of Naboo. QUI-GON forty years old, has long brown hair in a ponytail. He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is twenty five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes.

OBI-WAN: 
I have a bad feeling about this.

QUI-GON: 
I don't sense anything.

OBI-WAN: 
It's not about the mission, Master, it's something... elsewhere... elusive.

QUI-GON: 
Don't center on your anxieties, Obi-Wan. Keep your concentration here and now where it belongs.

OBI-WAN: 
But Master Yoda says I should be mindful of the future...

QUI-GON: 
... but not at the expense of the moment. Be mindful of the living Force, my young Padawan.

OBI-WAN: 
Yes, Master.
They walk over to the window and gaze out into space.

OBI-WAN: (cont'd) 
How do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?

QUI-GON: 
These Federation types are cowards. The negotiations will be short.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-14.

NUTE: (shaken) 
What?! What did you say?

TC-14: 
The Ambassadors are Jedi Knights, I believe.

DOFINE: 
I knew it! They're here to force a settlement.

NUTE: 
Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.

DOFINE: 
Are you brain-dead? I'm not going in there with two Jedi! Send a droid.

DOFINE turns to TC-14, who lets out a squeaky sigh.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN sit at the large conference table.

OBI-WAN: 
Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?

The door to the conference room slides open, and TC-14 enters with a tray of drinks and food.

QUI-GON: 
No... I sense an unusual amount of fear for something as trivial as this trade dispute.

TC-14 walks over to OBI-WAN who takes a drink. The droid then walks over to QUI-GON who takes a drink as TC-14 leaves the room.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE, DOFINE, and RUNE HAAKO are before the hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS, a robed figure whose face is obscured by a hood.

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
What is it?

DOFINE: 
This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious. The blockade is finished! We dare not go against these Jedi.

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again.

NUTE gives DOFINE a stern look and DOFINE bows his head in shame as he turns and walks away.

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
This turn of events is unfortunate. We must accelerate our plans. Begin landing your troops.

NUTE: 
My Lord, is that... legal?

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
I will make it legal.

NUTE: 
And the... Jedi?

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
The Chancellor should never have brought them into this. Kill them immediately.

NUTE: 
Yes My Lord. As you wish.

INT REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT - DOCKING BAY

In the cockpit of the cruiser, the CAPTAIN and PILOT look up to see a gun turret swing around and point directly at them.

PILOT: 
Captain, look!

The CAPTAIN looks up and just seconds before they are fired upon

CAPTAIN: 
Shields-

EXT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HANGAR BAY - SPACE (FX)

The battleship gun fires and the republic cruiser EXPLODES.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN leap to a standing position with their laser swords drawn. TC-14 jumps back, started, spilling the drinks on the tray.

TC-14: 
Sorry.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn off their laser swords and listen intently. A faint hissing sound can be heard.

QUI-GON: 
Dioxis.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY

A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in the conference room hallway.

NUTE: 
They must be dead by now. Destroy what's left of them.

The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously opens the door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room. BATTLE DROIDS cock their weapons as a figure stumbles out of the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the tray of drinks.

TC-14: 
Oh! Excuse me.

The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp.

OWO-1: 
Check it out Corporal. We'll cover you.

BATTLE DROID: 
Roger, roger.

Two flashing laser swords suddenly fly out of the deadly fog.

OWO-1: 
Uh-oh, blast them...

The two Jedi start cutting down BATTLE DROIDS as the droids fire on them. OBI-WAN jumps in the air and does a mid-air flip as he deflects laser bolts.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-1 on the viewscreen.

OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half. RUNE gives NUTE a worried look.

NUTE: 
What is going on down there?

The bridge is a cacophony of alarms.

TEY HOW: 
We lost the transmission, sir.

RUNE: 
Have you ever encountered a Jedi Knight before, sir?

NUTE: 
Well, no, but I don't- Seal off the bridge.

TEY HOW: 
Yes, sir.

RUNE: 
That won't be enough, sir.

NUTE: 
I want droidekas up here at once!

RUNE: 
We will not survive this.

The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower of sparks and metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending several BATTLE DROIDS crashing into the wall.

QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut through it.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the bridge door. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.

NUTE: 
Close the blast doors!

The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a second door, then a third. There is a hissing sound as the huge doors seal shut.

NUTE: 
That will hold them.

QUI-GON s tabs the door with his sword. The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the center of the blast door. OBI-WAN cuts down another BATTLE DROID in defense of his Master.

RUNE: 
They are still coming through!

On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.

NUTE: 
This is impossible!

RUNE: 
Where are those droidekas?

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE

Two ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at full speed. Just before they get to the bridge area, they stop and transform into their battle configuration.

OBI-WAN: 
Master! Destroyers!

QUI-GON stops penetrating the blast doors and turns to fight off the destroyer droids with OBI-WAN. The droids start to shoot their laser guns at the Jedi and an invisible shield appears around them.

OBI-WAN: 
They have shield generators.

QUI-GON: 
It's a standoff! Let's go!

QUI-GON and OBI-Wan leave the hallway just outside the bridge as the two destroyer droids turn around and continue shooting. The Jedi materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash through the doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast away at the two JEDI with their laser swords.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen as the WHEEL DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.

RUNE: 
They're no match for droidekas.

TEY HOW: 
Sir! They've gone up the ventilation shaft.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger bay. They are careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE DROIDS are loading onto landing craft.

QUI-GON: 
Battle droids.

OBI-WAN: 
It's an invasion army.

QUI-GON: 
This is an odd play for the Trade Federation. We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum. Let's split up. Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.

OBI-WAN: 
You were right about one thing, Master. The negotiations were short.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW receives a transmission.

TEY HOW: 
Sir, a transmission from the planet.

RUNE: 
It's Queen Amidala herself.

NUTE: 
At last we are getting results.

On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room. Wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits, surrounded by the GOVERNING COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS, EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.

NUTE: 
Again you come before us, Your Highness.

AMIDALA: 
You will not be so pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy. Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.

NUTE smirks at RUNE.

NUTE: 
I was not aware of such failure.

AMIDALA: 
I have word that the Chancellor's Ambassadors are with you now, and that you have been commanded to reach a settlement.

NUTE: 
I know nothing of any Ambassadors. You must be mistaken.

AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.

AMIDALA: 
Beware, Viceroy. The Federation has gone too far this time.

NUTE: 
We would never do anything without the approval of the Senate. You assume too much.

AMIDALA: 
We will see.

The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.

RUNE: 
She's right, the Senate will never-

NUTE: 
It's too late now.

RUNE: 
Do you think she suspects an attack?

NUTE: 
I don't know. But we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.

INT NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM

The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand before a hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.

PALPATINE: 
Negotiations haven't started because the Ambassadors aren't there? How could that be true? I have assurances from the Chancellor his Ambassadors did arrive. It must- handiwork- negotiate- ambassadors- nobody would-

The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.

AMIDALA: 
Senator Palpatine! What's happening?

CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to his SARGEANT

CAPT. PANAKA: 
Check the transmission generator.

BIBBLE: 
A communications disruption can mean only one thing: Invasion.

AMIDALA: 
The Federation would not dare go that far.

CAPT. PANAKA: 
The Senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.

AMIDALA: 
We must continue to rely on negotiation.

BIBBLE: 
Negotiation? We've lost all communications. And where are the Chancellors Ambassadors?

CAPT. PANAKA: 
This is a dangerous situation, Your Highness. Our security volunteers will be no match against a battle-hardened Federation army.

AMIDALA: 
I will not condone a course of action that will lead us to war.

EXT SPACE LANDING CRAFT - TWILIGHT (FX)

Six landing craft fly in formation toward the surface of the planet Naboo.

EXT NABOO SWAMP - SHALLOW LAKE - TWILIGHT

Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover of the perpetually gray twilight side of the planet. One by one, the Federation warships land in the eerie swamp.

TROOP TRANSPORTS (MTT's) emerge from the landing craft as a HALF DOZEN BATTLE DROIDS on STAPS fly by.

EXT NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP / GRASS PLAINS - TWILIGHT (FX)

The droid invasion force moves out of the swamp and onto a grassy plain. OOM-9, in his tank, looks out over the vast ARMY marching across the rolling hills. A small hologram of RUNE and NUTE stands on the tank.

OOM-9: 
Yes, Viceroy?

RUNE: 
Captain, we've searched the ship and there is no trace of the Jedi. They may have gotten on one of your landing craft.

OOM-9: 
If they are down here, sir, we'll find them.

NUTE: 
Use caution. These Jedi are not to be underestimated.

EXT NABOO SWAMP - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON runs through the strange landscape, glancing back to see the monstrous troop transports, emerging from the mist.

Animals begin to run past him in a panic.

An odd, frog-like GUNGAN, JAR JAR BINKS, squats holding a clam he has retrieved from the murky swamp. JAR JAR looks up and sees QUI-GON and the other creatures running like the wind toward him. One of the huge MTT's bears down on the JEDI like a charging locomotive. JAR JAR stands transfixed, still holding the clam shell in one hand.

JAR JAR: 
Oh, no!

QUI-GON: 
Get away! Get out of here!

JAR JAR drops the shell and leaps onto QUI-GON as he mumbles something inaudible. The JEDI is caught by surprise.

QUI-GON: 
Get down!

JAR JAR continues to mumble something. The machine is about to crush them as QUI-GON drops to the ground. JAR JAR goes splat into the mud with him. The transport races overhead.

QUI-GON and JAR JAR pull themselves out of the mud. They stand watching the war machine disappear into the mist.

JAR JAR: 
Whs'n dat?

QUI-GON starts to walk away to find OBI-WAN. JAR JAR runs after him.

JAR JAR: 
Hey, wait!

JAR JAR: 
Oh, mooie-mooie! I luv yous!

QUI-GON: 
You almost got us killed! Are you brainless?

JAR JAR: 
I spake.

QUI-GON: 
The ability to speak does not make you intelligent. Now get out of here!

QUI-GON starts to move off, and JAR JAR follows.

JAR JAR: 
No, no, mesa stay. Mesa culled Jar Jar Binks. Mesa your humble servant.

QUI-GON: 
That won't be necessary.

JAR JAR: 
Oh boot tit tis! Tis demunded byda guds it tis.

In the distance, two STAPS burst out of the mist at high speed, chasing OBI-WAN.

JAR JAR: (cont'd) 
Oh, nooooo!

QUI-GON throws JAR JAR into the mud.

QUI-GON: 
Stay down!

The two troops fire laser bolts at OBI-WAN. QUI-GON deflects the bolts back, and the STAPS blow up. One-two. OBI-WAN is exhausted and tries to catch his breath. Suddenly, JAR JAR pops up.

JAR JAR: 
You saved my again!

OBI-WAN: 
What's this?

QUI-GON: 
A local. Let's get out of here, before more droids show up.

JAR JAR: 
Mure? Mure did you spake?

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON start to run. JAR JAR tries to keep up.

JAR JAR: (cont'd) 
Ex-squeeze-me, but de mostest safest place would be Gunga City. Is where I grew up. 'Tis a hidden city.

They all stop.

QUI-GON: 
A city?

JAR JAR nods his head.

JAR JAR: 
Uh-huh.

QUI-GON: (cont'd) 
Can you take us there?'

JAR JAR: 
Ahhh, ... on second taut ... no, not willy, no.

QUI-GON: 
No? 

JAR JAR: 
Tis embarrissing, boot my afraid my've bean banished. My forgoten. Da Bosses would do terrible tings to me. Terrible tings to me if me goen back dare.

A PULSATING SOUND is heard in the distance.

QUI-GON: 
You hear that?

JAR JAR: 
Yeah.

QUI-GON: (cont'd) 
That's the sound of a thousand terrible things heading this way...

OBI-WAN: 
If they find us, they will crush us, grind us into little pieces, then blast us into oblivion!

JAR JAR: 
Oh! Yousa point is well said. Dis way! Hurry!

JAR JAR turns and runs into the swamp.

EXT NABOO SWAMP LAKE - TWILIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN and JAR JAR run into a murky lake and stop as JAR JAR tries to catch his breath. The TRANSPORTS ARE HEARD in the distance.

QUI-GON: 
How much farther?

JAR JAR: 
Wesa goen underwater, okeyday?

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN pull out small capsule from their utility belts that turn into breathing masks.

JAR JAR: (cont'd) 
... and my warning yous. Gungans no liken outsiders, so don't expicin wern welcome.

OBI-WAN: 
Don't worry, this has not been our day for warm welcomes.

JAR JAR jumps, yells out, does a double somersault with a twist, and dives into the water.

Breath masks on, QUI-GON and OBI-WAN wade in after him. Before they continue, JAR JAR surfaces.

JAR JAR: 
Ahh... yousa follow me now, okeyday?

EXT NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN swim behind JAR JAR, who is very much at home in the water. Down they swim into murky depths. In the distance the glow of Otoh Gunga, an underwater city made up of large bubbles, becomes more distinct.

They approach the strange, art nouveau habitat. JAR JAR swims magically through one of the bubble membranes, which seals behind him. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON follow.

INT OTOH GUNGA - CITY SQUARE

GUNGANS in the square scatter when they see the strange JEDI.

JAR JAR: 
Sooo good beein home.

Two GUNGANS start talking gibberish. JAR JAR and the JEDI walk a little further as a GUNGAN, CAPTAIN TARPALS, armed with a long electro-pole rides up on a two-legged KAADU into the square.

CAPT. TARPALS: 
Hey yousa, stopa there.

JAR JAR: 
Heyo-dalee, Cap'n Tarpals, Mesa back!

CAPT. TARPALS: 
Noah gain, Ja Ja. Yousa goen tada Bosses. Yousa in big dudu this time.

JAR JAR hangs his head and wines. Another GUARD comes up on KAADU armed with an electro-pole and gives JAR JAR a slight zap with his power pole. JAR JAR jumps and moves off, followed by the two JEDI.

JAR JAR: 
How wude.

INT OTOH GUNGA - HIGH TOWER BOARD ROOM

The Bosses' Board Room has bubble walls, with small lighted fish swimming around outside like moving stars. A long circular judge's bench filled with GUNGAN OFFICIALS dominates the room. OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand facing BOSS NASS, who sits on a bench higher than the others.

BOSS NASS: 
Yousa cannot bees hair. Dis army of mackineeks up dare tis new weesong!

QUI-GON: 
That droid army is about to attack the Naboo. We must warn them.

BOSS NASS: 
Wesa no like da Naboo! Da Naboo tink day so smarty. Day tink day brains so big.

OBI-WAN: 
Once those droids take control of the surface, they will take control of you.

BOSS NASS: 
Mesa no tink so. Dey not know of uss-en.

OBI-WAN: 
You and the Naboo form a symbiont circle. What happens to one of you will affect the other. You must understand this.

BOSS NASS: 
Wesa no care-n about da Naboo.

QUI-GON: (waves his hand) 
Then speed us on our way.

BOSS NASS: 
Wesa gonna speed yousaway.

QUI-GON: 
We could use a transport.

BOSS NASS: 
Wesa give yousa una bongo. Da speedest way tooda Naboo tis goen through da core. Now go.

QUI-GON: 
Thank you for your help. We leave in peace.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN turn to leave.

OBI-WAN: 
Master, what's a bongo?

QUI-GON: 
A transport, I hope.

The JEDI notice JAR JAR in chains to one side, waiting to hear his verdict. QUI-GON stops. JAR JAR gives him a forlorn look.

JAR JAR: 
Daza setten yousa up. Goen through da planet core is bad bombin!! Ahhh... any hep hair would be hot.

JAR JAR's soulful look is counter-pointed by a sheepish grin.

OBI-WAN: 
Master, we're short of time.

QUI-GON: 
We'll need a navigator to get us through the planet's core. This Gungan my be of help.

QUI-GON walks back to BOSS NASS.

QUI-GON: (cont'd) 
What is to become of Jar Jar Binks here?

BOSS NASS: 
Hisen to be pune-ished.

JAR JAR hangs his head and wines.

QUI-GON: 
I have saved his life. He owes me what you call a life-debt.

QUI-GON waves his hand.
Your gods demand that his life belongs to me now.

BOSS NASS: 
Binks. Yousa haveda liveplay with thisen hisen?

JAR JAR: 
Ah-huh.

BOSS NASS: 
Begone wit him.

JAR JAR: 
Count mesa outta dis one! Better dead here, den deader in da core...Yee guds, whata mesa sayin?!

EXT NABOO CITY - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

A strange little submarine propels itself away from the Otoh Gunga, leaving the glow of the settlement in the distance.

INT SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

OBI-WAN in the co-pilots seat, JAR JAR guides the craft.

JAR JAR: 
Dis is nutsen... Ooo, gooberfish!

OBI-WAN: 
Why were you banished, Jar Jar?

JAR JAR: 
Tis a longo taleo, buta small part of it wawdbe mesa... aaaa..... clumsy.

OBI-WAN: 
You were banished because you were clumsy?

JAR JAR: 
Ahh... Yousa mighten be sayin dat.

JAR JAR veers the craft to the left and turns the lights on. The coral vistas are grand, fantastic, and wondrous.

As the little sub glides into the planet core, a large dark shape begins to follow.

JAR JAR: 
Mesa cause-ed mabee one or duey lettal bitty axadentes...yud-say boom da gasser, un crash Der Bosses heyblibber...den banished.

Suddenly there is a loud CRASH, and the little craft lurches to one side. QUI-GON looks around and sees a huge, luminous

OPEE SEA KILLER has hooked them with its long gooey tongue.

JAR JAR: 
Uh-oh. Big gooberfish. Huge Opee.

Suddenly an even larger monster has attacked the OPEE SEA KILLER.

QUI-GON: 
There's always a bigger fish.

As the sub zooms away they see a larger set of jaws, munching on the hapless KILLER. The jaws belong to the incredible SANDO AQUA MONSTER. The lights on the tiny sub begin to flicker as they cruise deeper into the gloom.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

NUTE: 
The invasion is on schedule, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
I have the Senate bogged down in procedures. They will have no choice but to accept your control of the system.

NUTE: 
The Queen has great faith the Senate will side with her.

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
Queen Amidala is young and naive. You will find controlling her will not be difficult.

NUTE: 
Yes, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades away.

RUNE: 
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi?

NUTE: 
No need to report that to him, until we have something to report.

INT SUB COCKPIT - UNDERWATER

JAR JAR: 
Where wesa goin.

QUI-GON: 
Don't worry, the Force will guide us...

JAR JAR: 
Ooooh, maxibig... da Force... Well, dat smells stinkowiff.

An alarm sounds on the control panel.

OBI-WAN: 
We're losing power.

JAR JAR: 
Oh, no...

OBI-WAN lands the sub in a cave and the lights go out.

JAR JAR: 
Oh, wesa diein here.

QUI-GON: 
Just relax. We're not in trouble yet.

JAR JAR: 
What yet? Monstairs out dare! Leak'n in here, all'n sink'n, and nooooo power! You nutsen! WHEN YOUSA TINKEN WESA IN TROUBLE?!!!?

The wires start to spark.

OBI-WAN: 
Power's back.

The lights flicker on, revealing an ugly COLO CLAW FISH right in front of them.

The large COLO CLAW FISH is surprised and rears back. The sub turns around and speeds away.

JAR JAR continues to panic and babble incoherently.

QUI-GON: 
Relax.

QUI-GON puts his hand on JAR JAR's shoulder. JAR JAR relaxes into a coma.

OBI-WAN: 
You overdid it.

The COLO CLAW FISH leaps after the fleeing sub. The sub narrowly avoids the deadly teeth of the AQUA MONSTER. The COLO CLAW FISH chasing them isn't so lucky. It is munched in half by the larger predator.

JAR JAR regains consciousness.

QUI-GON: 
Head for that outcropping.

The long columns of the DROID ARMY move down the main road leading to Theed, the Naboo capital.

EXT THEED PLAZA - DAY (FX)

As the QUEEN watches helplessly from a window in the palace, a transport carrying NUTE and RUNE lands in Theed Plaza. They exit the transport.

OOM-9: 
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.

NUTE: 
Ah, victory!

INT NABOO LAKE - UNDERWATER - SUB (FX)

The little sub continues to propel itself toward the surface, which is brightly lit.

EXT THEED - ESTUARY - DAY

Paradise. Billowing clouds frame a romantic body of water. There is a LOUD RUSH OF BUBBLES, and a small sub bobs to the surface.

JAR JAR: 
Oo. Dis seem uverly.

QUI-GON stands and looks around to see if the coast is clear.

INT THEED - PALACE - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, SIO BIBBLE, and FIVE OF HER HANDMAIDENS (EIRTAE, YANE, PADME, RABE, SACHE) are surrounded by a half dozen DROIDS. CAPTAIN PANAKA and FOUR NABOO GUARDS are also with them as they are lead down stairs to the main floor. NUTE and RUNE are walking with the group.

BIBBLE: 
...how will you explain this invasion to the Senate?

NUTE: 
The Queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. I assurances it will be ratified by the Senate.

AMIDALA: 
I will not co-operate.

NUTE: 
Now, now, your Highness. In time, the suffering of your people will persuade you to see our point of view. Commander?

OOM-9 steps forward.

OOM-9: 
Yes, sir!

NUTE: 
Process them.

OOM-9 turns to his sergeant.

OOM-9: 
Captain, take them to Camp Four.

CAPTAIN: 
Roger, roger.

The SERGEANT marches the GROUP down the rest of the stairs and into the plaza.

EXT PALACE - PLAZA - DAY

QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTA, YANE, RABE, SACHE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, SIO BIBBLE, and FOUR GUARDS are led out of the palace by ten BATTLE DROIDS. The plaza is filled with tanks and BATTLE DROIDS, which they pass on their way to the detention camp. Unbeknownst to them, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and JAR JAR sneak across on a walkway above the plaza and jump from a balcony to begin an attack to rescue the QUEEN.

FOUR BATTLE DROIDS are instantly cut down. MORE DROIDS move forward and are also cut down by the JEDIS' flashing lightsabres until there is only the DROID SERGEANT left. The SERGEANT starts to run but is pulled back to QUI-GON by the Force, until finally he is dispatched by the JEDI.

QUI-GON: 
We should leave the streets, your highness.

SIO BIBBLE takes QUEEN AMIDALA away.

CAPTAIN PANAKA turns to the GUARDS.

CAPTAIN PANAKA: 
Get their weapons.

JAR JAR: 
Woah. Yousa guys bombad!

QUEEN AMIDALA and the OTHERS are amazed. JAR JAR is getting used to this. They move between two buildings.

QUI-GON: We're the Ambassadors, for the Supreme Chancellor.

BIBBLE: 
Your negotiations seem to have failed, Ambassador.

QUI-GON: 
The negotiations never took place. It's urgent that we make contact with the republic.

CAPTAIN PANAKA steps forward.

CAPT. PANAKA: 
They've knocked out all our communications.

QUI-GON: 
Do you have transports?

CAPT. PANAKA: 
In the main hanger. This way.

THEY disappear down an alleyway as the ALARMS are sounded

INT CENTRAL HANGER - HALLWAY - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA cracks open a side door to the central hanger. QUI-GON looks in over his shoulder. OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, and the rest of the group are behind him. They see several Naboo spacecraft guarded by about FIFTY BATTLE DROIDS. ALARMS can be heard in the distance.

CAPT. PANAKA: 
There are too many of them.

QUI-GON: 
That won't be a problem. Your Highness, under the circumstances, Isuggest you come to Coruscant with us.

AMIDALA: 
Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is here with my people.

QUI-GON: 
They will kill you if you stay.

BIBBLE: 
They wouldn't dare.

CAPT. PANAKA: 
They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion of theirs legal. They can't afford to kill her.

QUI-GON: 
There is something else behind all this, Your Highness. There is no logic in the Federation's move here. My feelings tell me they will destroy you.

BIBBLE: Our only hope is for the Senate to side with us ... Senator Palpatine will need your help.

AMIDALA: Either choice presents great danger.

The QUEEN turns to PADME and EIRTAE.

AMIDALA: (cont'd) 
... to us all.

PADME: 
We are brave, Your Highness.

QUI-GON: 
If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.

AMIDALA: 
Then, I will plead our case to the Senate. Be careful, Governor.

INT CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

The door opens to the main hanger. QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, JAR JAR, CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, and THREE HANDMAIDENS (PADME, EIRTAE, RABE), followed by QUEEN AMIDALA, head for a sleek chrome spacecraft. SIO BIBBLE, YANE and SACHE stay behind. The HANDMAIDENS begin to cry.

CAPT. PANAKA: 
We need to free those pilots.

CAPTAIN PANAKA points to TWENTY GUARDS, GROUND CREW, and PILOTS held in a corner by SIX BATTLE DROIDS.

OBI-WAN: 
I'll deal with that.

OBI-WAN heads toward the group of captured pilots.

QUI-GON and the QUEEN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, JAR JAR, and the rest Of the GROUP approach the GUARDS at the ramp of the Naboo craft.

GUARD DROID: 
Halt?

QUI-GON: 
I'm Ambassador for the Supreme Chancellor, and I'm taking these people to Coruscant.

GUARD DROID: 
Where are you taking them?

QUI-GON: 
To Coruscant.

GUARD DROID: 
Coruscant!? Ahh, that doesn't compute. ... Ahh, wait! ... Ahh, you're under arrest!

The DROID GUARD draws his weapon, but before any of the DROIDS can fire, they are cut down. OTHER GUARDS run to their aid.

OBI-WAN attacks the GUARDS around the PILOTS.

OBI-WAN: 
Go!

QUI-GON stands, fighting off DROIDS as the OTHERS rush on board the spacecraft. OBI-WAN, the FREED PILOTS (including RIC OLIE), GUARDS and GROUND CREW MEMBERS rush on board the ship. 
The OTHER PILOTS and GUARDS race to SIO BIBBLE. After everyone has made it onto the ship, QUI-GON jumps on board.

The ship exits the hanger.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - DROID HOLD

JAR JAR is led into a low, cramped doorway by OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN: 
Now stay here, and keep out of trouble.

OBI-WAN closes the door. JAR JAR looks around and sees a long row of five short, dome-topped ASTRO DROIDS (R-2 units). 
The all look alike, except for thier paint color, and they all seem to be shut down.

JAR JAR: 
Ello, boyos.

The droids chirp and whistle in response.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

The PILOT, RIC OLIE, navigates toward the massive battleship. QUI-GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch.

The Naboo spacecraft, surrounded by EXPLOSIONS, heads even closer to the massive Federation battleships.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

QUI-GON enters the cockpit.

RIC OLIE: 
There's the blockade.

OBI-WAN enters the cockpit as the blockade battleships fire upon them. ALARM SOUNDS fill the cockpit.

RIC OLIE: 
The shield generator's been hit.

INT NABOO SPACECRAT - DROID HOLD (FX)

A blue alarm light flashes as all the DROIDS are activated. The DROIDS rush to an exterior air lock.

One LITTLE BLUE ASTRO DROID, who is especially dedicated, lets out a loud screech as he runs into JAR JAR.

JAR JAR: 
How wude!

The BLUE ASTRO DROID continues to beep in exclamation as he too rushes toward the air lock.

The LITTLE DROID enters the air lock and is ejected onto the exterior of the ship.

EXT NABOO SPACECRAFT - SPACE (FX)

The LITTLE DROID rolls towards the others to help with repairs. One by one each DROID is being blown away.

INT NABOO SPACECRAT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN: 
We're loosing droids... fast.

CAPTAIN PANAKA: 
If we can't get the shield generators fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.

EXT NABOO SPACECRAFT - ENGINES - SPACE (FX)

The BLUE DROID is now alone as he contines to work on the ship. He connects some wires, causing sparks to fly.

INT NABOO SPACECRAT - COCKPIT

RIC OLIE: 
Powers back! That little droid did it... bypassed the main power drive. Deflector shield up, at maximum.

EXT NABOO SPACECRAFT - SPACE (FX)

The lone BLUE DROID finishes his repairs and goes back into the ship. The Naboo spacecraft races away from the Federation battleship.

RIC OLIE: 
There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant... the hyperdrive is leaking.

QUI-GON: 
We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship.

QUI-GON studies a star chart on a monitor.

OBI-WAN: 
Here, Master. Tatooine... It's small, out of the way, poor... The Trade Federation has no presence there.

CAPT. PANAKA: 
How can you be sure?

QUI-GON: 
It's controlled by the Hutts...

CAPT. PANAKA: 
You can't take Her Royal Highness there! The Hutts are gangsters ... If they discovered her ...

QUI-GON: 
... It would be no different than if we landed on a system controlled by the Federation ... except the Hutts aren't looking for her, which gives us an advantage.

CAPTAIN PANAKA takes a deep breath in frustration.

EXT SPACE - FEDERATION BATTLESHIP (FX)

The Federation battleship looms over the planet of Naboo.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM

NUTE and RUNE sit around a conference table with a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
... And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?

NUTE: 
She has disappeared, My Lord. One Naboo cruiser got pat the blockade.

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
I want that treaty signed.

NUTE: 
My Lord, it's impossible to locate the ship. It's out of our range.

DARTH SIDIOUS: 
...not for a Sith...

A second SITH LORD appears behind DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS: (Cont'd) 
... This is my apprentice. Darth Maul. He will find your lost ship.

The hologram fades off.

NUTE: 
This is getting out of hand ... now there are two of them.

RUNE: 
We should not have made this bargain.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the LITTLE BLUE DROID stand before QUEEN AMIDALA and her THREE HANDMAIDENS, PADME, EIRTAE and RABE.

CAPT. PANAKA: 
An extremely well put together little droid. Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.

AMIDALA: 
It is to be commended...what is its number?

The LITTLE BLUE DROID lets out a series of bleeps. CAPTAIN PANAKA leans over and scrapes some dirt off of the side of the DROID and read the number:

CAPT. PANAKA: 
R2-D2, Your Highness.

AMIDALA: 
Thank you, Artoo Detoo... Padme!

PADME bows before the QUEEN.

AMIDALA: (Cont'd) 
Clean this droid up the best you can. It deserves our gratitude... Continue, Captain.

CAPTAIN PANAKA looks nervously to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

QUI-GON: 
Your Highness, with your permission we're heading for a remote planet called Tatooine. It is a system far beyond the reach of the Trade Federation.

CAPTAIN PANAKA: 
I do not agree with the Jedi on this.

QUI-GON: 
You must trust my judgment, Your Highness.

AMIDALA and PADME exchange looks.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - MAIN AREA

PADME sits in the Main Area, cleaning R2-D2, the brave little Astro Droid. JAR JAR pops out of an open door.

PADME jumps. The Gungan is embarrassed that he frightened them.

JAR JAR: (Cont'd) 
Sorry. Whosa are yousa?

PADME: 
I'm Padme.

JAR JAR steps into the room.

JAR JAR:

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and CAPTAIN PANAKA watch over RIC OLIE'S shoulder. A large yellow planet appears directly ahead. RIC OLIE searches his scopes.

OBI-WAN: 
That's it. Tatooine... There's a settlement.

QUI-GON: 
Land near the outskirts. We don't want to attract any attention.

EXT TATOOINE - SPACE (FX)

The ship heads toward the planet of Tatooine.

The Naboo spacecraft lands in the desert in a swirl of dust. The spaceport of Mos Espa is seen in the distance.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - ENGINE ROOM

OBI-WAN is hoisting the hyperdrive out of a floor panel.

OBI-WAN: 
The hyperdrive generator's gone, Master.

QUI-GON: 
That'll complicate things. Be wary... I sense a disturbance in the Force.

OBI-WAN: 
I feel it also, Master.

QUI-GON: 
Don't let them send any transmissions.

EXT TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

They start their trek across the desert toward the city of Mos Espa. In the distance, a strange looking caravan makes its way toward the spaceport.

JAR JAR: 
Dis sun doen murder ta mesa skin.

From the spaceship, CAPTAIN PANAKA and PADME run toward them.

CAPT. PANAKA: 
Wait!

QUI-GON stops as they catch up. PADME is dresses in rough peasant's garb.

CAPT. PANAKA: (Cont'd) 
Wait. Her Highness commands you to take her handmaiden with you.

QUI-GON: 
No more commands from Her Highness today, Captain. This spaceport is not going to be pleasant...

CAPT. PANAKA: 
The Queen wishes it. She is curious about this planet.

QUI-GON: 
This is not a good idea. Stay close to me.

He gives PADME a stern look.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

The little GROUP walks down the main street of Mos Espa. They pass dangerous looking citizens of all types. PADME looks around in awe at this exotic environment.

QUI-GON: 
...moisture farms for the most part. Some indigenous tribes and scavengers. The few spaceports like this one are havens for those who do not wish to be found...

PADME: 
... like us.

JAR JAR is in a constant state of panic.

JAR JAR: 
Dissen berry berry bad. Ooooh... icky... icky... goo.

ARTOO whistles along, with perfect confidence.

EXT MOS ESPA - JUNK DEALER PLAZA - DAY

The GROUP comes to a little plaza surrounded by several junk spaceship dealers.

QUI-GON: 
We'll try one of the smaller dealers.

They head for a little junk shop that has a huge pile of broken spaceships stacked up behind it.

INT WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

QUI-GON, JAR JAR, PADME, and ARTOO enter the dingy junk shop and are greeted by WATTO, a pudgy blue alien who flies on short little wings like a hummingbird.

WATTO:
Guta naloya. (Good day to you.)

WATTO flies over to the visitors.

WATTO: 
Ha chuba da nala? (What do you want?)

QUI-GON: 
I need parts for a J-type 327 Nubian.

WATTO: 
Ah yes, ah yes. Nubian. We have lots of that. Peedenk! Naba dee unko! (Boy, get in here! Now!)

QUI-GON: My droid here has a readout of what I need.

A disheveled boy, ANAKIN SKYWALKER, runs in from the junk yard. He is about nine years old, very dirty, and dressed in rags.

WATTO turns to ANAKIN.

WATTO: (subtitled) 
Coona tee-tocky malia? (What took you so long?)

ANAKIN: (subtitled) 
Mel tassa cho-passa... (I was cleaning the bin like you...)

WATTO: (subtitled) 
Chut-Chut! Ganda doe wallya. Me dwana no bata. (Watch the store. I've got some selling to do here.)
Soooo, let me take a thee out back. Ni you'll find what you need.

ARTOO and QUI-GON follow WATTO toward the junk yard, leaving JAR JAR with PADME and the young boy ANAKIN. JAR JAR picks up a gizmo, trying to figure out its purpose. QUI-GON takes the part out of his hand and puts it back.

QUI-GON: 
Don't touch anything.

JAR JAR makes a rude face to QUI-GON's back and sticks out his long tongue. ANAKIN sits on the counter, pretending to clean a part, staring at PADME. She is the most beautiful creature he has ever seen in his life. PADME is a little embarrassed by his stare, but she musters up an amused smile. Finally, he gets the courage to speak.

ANAKIN: 
Are you an angel?

PADME: 
What?

ANAKIN: 
An angel. I've heard the deep space pilots talk about them. They are the most beautiful creatures in the universe. They live on the Moons of Iego I think.

PADME looks at him, not knowing what to say.

PADME: 
You're a funny little boy. How do you know so much?

ANAKIN: 
I listen to all the traders and starpilots that come by here. I'm a pilot, you know, and some day I'm gonna fly away from this place.

PADME: 
You're a pilot?

ANAKIN: 
All my life.

PADME: 
How long have you been here?

ANAKIN: Since I was very little, three, I think. My Mom and I were sold to Gardulla the Hutt, but she lost us, betting on the Podraces.

PADME: 
You're ... a slave?

ANAKIN looks at PADME defiantly.

ANAKIN: 
I am a person and my name is Anakin.

PADME: 
I'm sorry. I don't fully understand. This is a strange place to me.

ANAKIN studies her intently.

JAR JAR pushes the nose on what appears to be a LITTLE DROID, and it instantly comes to life, grows legs and arms, and starts marching around, knocking over everything. JAR JAR hold on but can't stop it.

ANAKIN: Hey...

JAR JAR: Wha?

ANAKIN: Hit the nose!

JAR JAR: Oh!

JAR JAR hits the nose, and the DROID collapses back into its original state. ANAKIN and PADME laugh.

EXT WATTO'S JUNK YARD - BEHIND SHOP - DAY

WATTO flies along as QUI-GON walks through the junk yard.

WATTO: ... a T-14 hyperdrive generator!! Thee in luck, I'm the only one hereabouts who has one... but thee might as well buy a new ship. It would be cheaper, I think... Saying of which, how's thee going to pay for all this?

QUI-GON: I have 20,000 Republic dataries.

WATTO: Republic credits?!? Republic credits are no good out here. I need something more real...

QUI-GON: I don't have anything else. (raising his hand) But credits will do fine.

WATTO: No they won'ta.

QUI-GON, using his mind power, waves his hand again.

QUI-GON: Credits will do fine.

WATTO: No, they won'ta. What you think you're some kinda Jedi, waving your hand around like that? I'm a Toydarian. Mind tricks don'ta work on me-only money. No money, no parts! No deal! And no one else has a T-14 hyperdrive, I promise you that.

INT WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

ANAKIN and PADME are still talking.

ANAKIN: ... wouldn't have lasted long if I weren't so good at fixing things.

JAR JAR pulls a part out of a stack of parts to inspect it, and they all come tumbling down. He struggles to catch them, only to knock more down. ANAKIN and PADME are oblivious.

QUI-GON hurries into the shop, followed by ARTOO.

QUI-GON: We're leaving. Jar Jar?

The stuff JAR JAR is juggling crashes to the ground. PADME gives ANAKIN a loving look.

PADME: I'm glad to have met you.

PADME turns, and ANAKIN looks sad as he watches her leave.

ANAKIN: I was glad to meet you too.

JAR JAR and ARTOO leave the shop.

WATTO enters the shop, shaking his head.

WATTO: (subtitled) Ootmians! Tinka me chasa hopoe ma booty na nolia. (Outlanders! They think they know everything.)

ANAKIN: (subtitled) La lova num botaffa. (They seemed nice to me.)

WATTO: (subtitled) Fweepa niaga. Tolpa da bunky dunko. (Clean the racks... then you can go home.)

ANAKIN lets out a "yipee" and runs out the back.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - COCKPIT

OBI-WAN is in the cockpit of the Naboo craft.

QUI-GON: ... and you're sure there's nothing left on board?

OBI-WAN: (V.O) A few containers of supplies, the Queen's wardrobe, maybe. But not enough for you to barter with. Not in the amounts you're talking about.

QUI-GON: All right. I'm sure another solution will present itself. I'll check back later.

QUI-GON puts his comlink away and starts out into the main street. JAR JAR grabs his arm.

JAR JAR: Noah gain... Noah gain da beings hereabouts cawazy. Wesa be robbed un crunched.

QUI-GON: Not likely. We have nothing of value, that's our problem.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - MARKET - DAY

QUI-GON, PADME, JAR JAR, and ARTOO move out into the street. JAR JAR is walking behind the others. They walk by an outdoor cafe filled with a rough gang of aliens, one of which is especially ugly, SEBULBA, a spider-like creature. 
JAR JAR stops for a moment in front of a stall selling dead frogs hanging on a wire. 
JAR JAR: Muy, Muy.
He looks around to see if anyone is looking, then sticks out his tongue, and gets hold of one, pulling it into his mouth. Unfortunately, the frog is tied tightly to the wire. The vendor suddenly appears.
VENDOR: (subtitled) Ay, ay. Yawoba wonga? (Are you going to pay for that?)

JAR JAR turns his head in surprise.

VENDOR: Uga wupiupi wep. (It costs seven wupiupi).

JAR JAR: Wupiwupi?
opens his mouth and the frog snaps away., ricochets around the market, and lands in Sebulba's soup, splashing him. As JAR JAR moves away from the VENDOR, SEBULBA jumps up on the table and grabs the hapless Gungan.

SEBULBA: Chuba!!

JAR JAR: Ooops.

JAR JAR starts to whistle as he walks away.

Angry, SEBULBA gets up an hops over to JAR JAR and kicks him.

SEBULBA: (subtitled) Ni chuba ni?? (Is this yours??)

SEBULBA holds the frog up to the Gungan threateningly.

JAR JAR: Who, mesa?

SEBULBA grabs JAR JAR by the neck. QUI-GON looks around for JAR JAR and sees him in a fight.

JAR JAR turns to see ANAKNI pushing his way next to him. The boy stands up to SEBULBA in a very self-assured way.

ANAKIN: (subtitled) Chesko Sebulba... Cha pooka uman geesa... Matesa ratico ponipa chop chowa. (Careful, Sebulba... He's a big time outlander... I'd hate to see you diced before we race again.)

SEBULBA stops his assault on JAR JAR and turns to ANAKIN.

SEBULBA: (subtitled) Nic me chouwa wimo noke maka noke. (Next time we race, boy, it will be the end of you!) Una noto wo shag, me wompity du pom pom. (If you weren't a slave, I'd squash you now.)

SEBULBA turns away.

ANAKIN: (subtitled) Eh, chee bana do mullee ra. (Yeah, it'd be a pity if you had to pay for me.)
§§§
QUI-GON, PADME and ARTOO arrive.

ANAKIN: (Cont'd) Hi!

QUI-GON: Hi there.

ANAKIN: Your buddy here was about to be turned into orange goo. He picked a fight with a Dug. An especially dangerous Dug called Sebulba.

JAR JAR: Mesa haten crunchen. Dat's da last ting mesa wanten.

QUI-GON: Nevertheless, the boy is right ... you were heading for trouble... Thanks, my young friend.

PADME looks at ANAKIN and smiles; he smiles back. They start walking down the crowded street.

JAR JAR: But... but... mesa doen nutteen!

The group walks away and SEBULBA chews on the frog.

EXT TATOOINE - DESERT - SPACESHIP - DAY

OBI-WAN stands in front of the Naboo spacecraft as the wind picks up and begins to whip at his robe. CAPTAIN PANAKA exits the ship and joins him.

OBI-WAN: This storm will slow them down.

CAPT. PANAKA: It looks pretty bad.

CAPTAIN PANAKA's comlink sounds off.

RIC OLIE: (V.O.) We're receiving a message from home.

CAPT. PANAKA: We'll be right there.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - FRUIT STAND - DAY

ANAKIN and the GROUP stop at a fruit stand run by a jolly, but very poor, old lady named JIRA.

ANAKIN: Here, you'll like these pallies... Here.

QUI-GON: Thank you.

QUI-GON takes them puting them in a little pouch under his poncho, revealing for a moment, his lightsaber.

JIRA: Oh, my bones are aching ... storm's coming up, Annie. You'd better get home quick.

ANAKIN: (to QUI-GON) Do you have shelter?

QUI-GON: We'll head back to our ship.

ANAKIN: Is it far?

PADME: It's on the outskirts.

ANAKIN: You'll never reach the outskirts in time... sandstorms are very, very dangerous. Come on! I'll take you to my place.

The GROUP follows ANAKIN as he rushes down the windy street. ARTOO wistles along the way.

Anakin's mother, SHMI SKYWALKER, a warm, friendly woman of forty, enters from her work area and is startled to see the room full of people.

ANAKIN: These are my friends, Mom.

ANAKIN leads PADME into the other room. ARTOO follows, beeping all the way.

INT ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ARTOO rolls through the doorway as ANAKIN shows off his DROID, which is lying on his workbench. There is one eye in the head; the body, arms, and legs have no outer coverings.

ANAKIN: Isn't he great?! He's not finished yet.

PADME: He's wonderful!

ARTOO continues to lets out a few warbles.

ANAKIN: You really like him? He's a protocol droid ... to help Mom. Watch!

ANAKIN pushes a button, and the DROID sits up.

THREEPIO: Oh, oh. Where is everybody?

Anakin reaches over and grabs an eye and puts it in one of the sockets.

THREEPIO: Oh, hello, I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations. How might I serve you?

PADME: He's perfect.

THREEPIO: Oh, perfect.

ANAKIN: When the storm is over, I'll show you my racer.

THREEPIO starts to walk away as ANAKIN contines talking to PADME.

ANAKIN: (cont'd) I'm building a Podracer!

PADME smiles at his enthusiasm. THREEPIO: I'm not sure this floor is entirely stable. Oh, hello. I don't believe we've been introduced.

ARTOO lets out a flurry of beeps and whistles.

THREEPIO: Artoo-Detoo. A pleasure to meet you. I am See-Threepio, Human Cyborg Relations.

ARTOO lets out another series of beeps and whistles.

THREEPIO: I beg your pardon .... what do you mean, naked?

ARTOO beeps.

THREEPIO: (Cont'd) My parts are showing? My goodness.

ARTOO releases a laugh-like twitter.

EXT TATOOINE - SANDSTORM

The sandstorm rages on.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEENS CHAMBERS

AMIDALA, EIRTAE, RABE, and OBI-WAN watch a very bad transmission of a SIO BIBBLE hologram.

BIBBLE: ... the death toll is catastrophic...we must bow to their wishes... you must contact me ...

AMIDALA looks upset ... almost nervous.

OBI-WAN: It's a trick. Send no reply... Send no transmission of any kind.

INT ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON listens to his comlink. OBI-WAN is in the cockpit.

QUI-GON: It sounds like bait to establish a connection trace.

OBI-WAN: What if it is true and the people are dying?

QUI-GON: Either way, we're running out of time.

EXT CORUSCANT - BALCONY OVERLOOKING CITY - NIGHT

DARTH SIDIOUS and DARTH MAUL are walking along the balcony overlooking the vast city.

DARTH MAUL: Tatooine is sparsely populated. If the trace was correct, I will find them quickly, Master.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Move against the Jedi first...you will then have no difficulty in taking the Queen to Naboo to sign the treaty.

DARTH MAUL: At last we will reveal ourselves to the Jedi. At last we will have revenge.

DARTH SIDIOUS: You have been well trained, my young apprentice, they will be no match for you.

EXT MOS ESPA - SANDSTORM - DAY

The giant sandstorm engulfs the town, including the Naboo spaceship on the outskirts of the city center, where Watto's ship is; and the slave quarters, where drifts of sand begin building up against Anakin's house.

INT ANAKIN'S HOVEL - MAIN ROOM - DAY

QUI-GON, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and PADME are seated around a table. JAR JAR slurps his soup as SHMI walks over pours him a drink. JAR JAR looks up at her as she moves on. ARTOO beeps as he looks on from the corner of the room.

SHMI: All slaves have transmitters placed inside their bodies somewhere.

ANAKIN: I've been working on a scanner to try and locate mine.

SHMI: Any attempt to escape...

ANAKIN: ... and they blow you up ... boom!

JAR JAR: How wude.

PADME: I can't believe there is still slavery in the galaxy. The Republic's anti-slavery laws...

SHMI: The Republic doesn't exist out here...we must survive on our own.

JAR JAR snatches some food from a bowl at the other end of the table with his tongue. PADME looks over at JAR JAR. QUI-GON gives him a dirty look.

JAR JAR: 'Scuse me.

ANAKIN: Has anybody ever seen a Podrace?

PADME shakes her head no.

QUI-GON: They have Podracing on Malastare. Very fast, very dangerous.

ANAKIN: I'm the only human who can do it.

QUI-GON: You must have Jedi reflexes if you race Pods.

ANAKIN smiles. JAR JAR attempts to snare another bit of food from the bowl with his tongue, but QUI-GON, in a flash, grabs it between his thumb and forefinger. JAR JAR is startled.

QUI-GON: (Cont'd) Don't do that again.

JAR JAR tries to acknowledge with some silly mumbling. QUI-GON lets go of the tongue, and it snaps back into JAR JAR's mouth.

ANAKIN: You're a Jedi Knight, aren't you?

QUI-GON: What makes you think that?

ANAKIN: I saw your laser sword. Only Jedi carry that kind of weapon.

QUI-GON leans back and slowly smiles.

QUI-GON: Perhaps I killed a Jedi and took it from him.

ANAKIN: I don't think so ... No one can kill a Jedi.

QUI-GON: I wish that were so...

ANAKIN: I had a dream I was a Jedi. I came back here to free all the slaves... have you come to free us?

QUI-GON: No, I'm afraid not ...

ANAKIN: I think you have ... why else would you be here?

QUI-GON thinks for a moment.

QUI-GON: I can see there's no fooling you ... (leans forward) We're on our way to Coruscant, the central system in the Republic, on a very important mission.

ANAKIN: How did you end up here in the outer rim?

PADME: Our ship was damaged, and we're stranded here until we can repair it.

ANAKIN: I can help! I can fix anything!

QUI-GON: I believe you can, but first we must acquire the parts we need...

JAR JAR: Wit no-nutten mula to trade.

PADME: These junk dealers must have a weakness of some kind.

SHMI: Gambling. Everything here revolves around betting on those awful races.

QUI-GON: Podracing ... Greed can be a powerful ally.

ANAKIN: I've built a racer! It's the fastest ever...There's a big race tomorrow, on Boonta Eve. You could enter my pod.

SHMI: Anakin! Watto won't let you...

ANAKIN: Watto doesn't know I've built it. (to Qui-Gon) You could make him think it's yours, and get him to let me pilot it for you.

QUI-GON looks to SHMI. She is upset.

SHMI: I don't want you to race. It's awful. I die every time Watto makes you do it.

ANAKIN: But Mom, I love it. The prize money would more than pay for the parts they need.

SHMI: Anakin!

QUI-GON: Your mother's right. Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who might help us?

SHMI shakes her head no.

ANAKIN: Mom... you said the biggest problem in the universe is nobody helps each other...

SHMI sighs heavily.

PADME: I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way...

SHMI: No, there is no other way... I may not like it, but... he can help you... he was meant to help you.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

STREET PEOPLE fill the streets as a BANTHA and a few landspeeders go by. clean up the mess and rebuild their food stalls. QUI-GON, JAR JAR, and PADME are walking toward WATTOS shop. ARTOO is rolling behind thim.

PADME stops QUI-GON as he is about to enter the shop.

PADME: Are you sure about this? Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know. The Queen will not approve.

QUI-GON: The Queen does not need to know.

PADME: Well, I don't approve.

QUI-GON turns and starts into the shop.

INT WATTO'S JUNK SHOP - DAY

QUI-GON walks in, and WATTO and ANAKIN join him.

WATTO: The boy tells me you wanta sponser him in a race. How can you do this? Not on Republic credits, I think, huh. (he laughs)

QUI-GON: My ship will be the entry fee.

QUI-GON pulls a small object that looks like a watch out of his pocket, and a hologram of the Naboo spacecraft appears about a foot long in front of WATTO. He studies it.

WATTO: Oh, not bad... not bad... ah Nubian, ah.

QUI-GON: It's in good order, except for the parts I need.

WATTO: ... what would the boy ride? He smashed up my Pod in the last race. It will take some time to fix it.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and steps forward.

ANAKIN: Ahhhh ... it wasn't my fault really... Sebulba flashed me with his vents. I actually saved the Pod... mostly.

WATTO: (laughing) That you did huh. The boy is good, no doubts there huh.

QUI-GON: Well, I have acquired a Pod in a game of chance. "The fastest ever built."

WATTO: I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it. (laughs) So, you supply the Pod and the entry fee; I supply the boy. We split the winnings fifty-fifty, I think.

QUI-GON: If it's going to be fifty-fifty, I suggest you front the cash for the entry. If we win, you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need... If we lose, you keep my ship.

WATTO thinks about this. ANAKIN tries not to be nervous.

QUI-GON: (Cont'd) Either way, you win.

WATTO: Deal!

QUI-GON leaves the shop.

WATTO: (cont'd) (subtitled) Yo bana pee ho-tah, meedee ya. (Your friend is a follish one, methinks.)

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - LOUNGE

OBI-WAN stands in the lounge of the Naboo spacecraft, speaking into his comlink. QUI-GON is on the back porch of the hovel.

OBI-WAN: What if this plan fails, Master? We could be stuck here for a long time.

QUI-GON: (V.O) Well, it's too dangerous to call for help now. A ship without a power supply isn't gonna get us anywhere, and... there is something about this boy...

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

QUI-GON puts the comlink away as SHMI comes onto the porch. PADME, ANAKIN, JAR JAR, and ARTOO work on the engines of the Podracer in the courtyard below.

QUI-GON: You should be proud of your son. He gives without any thought of reward.

SHMI: Well he knows nothing of greed. He has a...

QUI-GON: He has special powers.

SHMI: Yes...

QUI-GON: He can see things before they happen. That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes. It is a Jedi trait.

SHMI: He deserves better than a slave's life.

QUI-GON: Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early. The Force is unusually strong with him, that much is clear. Who is his father?

SHMI: There was no father. I carried him, I gave birth, I raised him, I can't explain what happened.

QUI-GON nods.

SHMI: (cont'd) Can you help him?

QUI-GON: I don't know. I didn't actually come here to free slaves.

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - BACK YARD - DAY

KITSTER (a young boy about Anakin's age), SEEK (a red headed boy of ten), AMEE (a girl of nine), a LITTLE GIRL about six, and WALD (a RODIAN, six years old) join ANAKIN, JAR JAR, ARTOO, and PADME securing some wiring.

ARTOO whistles, hoots, in greeting.

KITSTER: Wow, a real Astro Droid... how'd you get so lucky?

ANAKIN: This isn't the half of it. I'm entered in the Boonta Race tomorrow!

KITSTER: What? With this??

WALD: (subtitled) Ona joka, Annie. (You are such a joker, Ani.)

AMEE: You've been working on that thing for years.

LITTLE GIRL: It's never gonna run.

SEEK: Come on, let's go and play ball. Keep racing, Ani, you're gonna be bug squash.

SEEK, WALD, AMEE and the LITTLE GIRL take off, laughing. JAR JAR is fiddling with one of the energy binder plates.

ANAKIN: Hey! Jar Jar! Keep away from those energy binders... If your hand gets caught in that beam, it will go numb for hours.

JAR JAR drops the tool he had, bends down to pick it up and come right up into the energy binders. It makes a little electronic pop, zaps him in the mouth and he jumps back. JAR JAR tries to say something, but his mouth is numb and his words are garbled.

JAR JAR: Ouch muy tonge is fat. Muy togne. Oucho. (Gibberish)

JAR JAR sees that a tool is stuck in the engine and reaches in to get it but gets his hand caught instead.

JAR JAR: Hey! Ou-oh. Ow, hey, I'm stuck.

THREEPIO: You know, I find that Jar Jar creature very... odd.

ARTOO twitters a response.

KITSTER: You don't even know if this things gonna run.

ANAKIN jumps into the little capsule behind the two giant engines.

ANAKIN: It will.

QUI-GON approaches the GROUP and gives ANAKIN a small battery.

QUI-GON: I guess it's time we found out. Here use this power charge.

QUI-GON: Come on Kitster. Lets move away.

JAR JAR: Mm... my mout. I'm stuck. Hep I'm s..

PADME sees JAR JARS trouble and walks over to help him.

JAR JAR: Muy tonge is fat...

ARTOO beeps something.

THREEPIO: You're quite right. He's very odd indeed.

JAR JAR: Ow, th... thank yous.

JAR JAR looks at ANAKIN and gives him the thumbs-up and walks away.

ANAKIN flips a switch and the engines ignite with a ROAR. EVERYONE looks at eachother with smiles.

ANAKIN: It's working! It's working!

EXT MOS ESPA - SLAVE QUARTERS - PORCH - DAY

SHMI, watching from the porch, smiles sadly.

EXT SLAVE QUARTERS - BALCONY - NIGHT

ANAKIN sits on the balcony rail of his hovel as QUI-GON tends to a cut. The BOY leans back to look at the vast blanket of stars in the sky.

QUI-GON: Stay still, Annie. Let me clean this cut.

ANAKIN: There are so many! Do they all have a system of planets?

QUI-GON: Most of them.

ANAKIN: Has anyone been to them all?

QU-IG0N: (laughs) Not likely.

ANAKIN: I want to be the first one to see them all ...

SHMI yells from inside the hovel.

SHMI: (O.S.) Annie, bedtime!

ANAKIN: (cont'd) ... Ouch!

QUI-GON wipes a patch of blood off ANAKIN's arm.

QUI-GON: There we are, good as new...

SHMI: (O.S.) Ani! I'm not going to tell you again!

QUI-GON scrapes ANAKIN's blood onto a comlink chip.

ANAKIN: What are you doing?

QUI-GON: Checking your blood for infections.

QUI-GON: You have a big day tomorrow. (beat) Goodnight.

ANAKIN rolls his eyes and runs into the hovel. QUI-GON takes the blood stained chip and inserts it into the comlink, then calls OBI-WAN.

QUI-GON: (Cont'd) Obi-Wan...

OBI-WAN: Yes, Master.

QUI-GON: I need an analysis of this blood sample I'm sending you.

OBI-WAN: Wait a minute...

QUI-GON: I need a midi-chlorian count.

OBI-WAN: The reading's off the chart... over twenty thousand. (V.O.) Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high!

QUI-GON: No Jedi has.

OBI-WAN: What does that mean?

QUI-GON: I'm not sure.

The JEDI KNIGHT looks up and sees SHMI in the doorway watching him. Embarrassed, she goes back into the kitchen while QUI-GON ponders the situation.

EXT TATOOINE - DESERT MESA - NIGHT

The sinister looking Sith spacecraft lands on top of a desert mesa at dus, scattering a herd of banthas. DARTH MAUL walks to the edge of the mesa and studies the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He picks out the lights of three different cities in the distance, then pushes buttons on his electronic armband.

Three football-sized PROBE DROIDS float out of the ship and head off in three different directions toward the cities.

DARTH MAUL stands on the mesa and watches them through his electrobinoculars.

EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

RACE CREWS mill about outside the Main Hanger.

INT MOS ESPA - ARENA - MAIN HANGER - DAY

The hanger is a large building with a dozen or so Podracers being readied for the race. ALIEN CREWS and PILOTS rush about, making last minute fixes on their vehicles. WATTO, QUI-GON, and JAR JAR walk through the activity.

WATTO: ... I wanta see your spaceship the moment the race is over.

QUI-GON: Patience, my good friend. You'll have your winnings before the suns set, and we'll be far away from here.

WATTO: Not if your ship belongs to me, I think... I warn you, no funny business.

QUI-GON: You don't think Anakin will win?

WATTO stops before an orange racer. Sitting to one side, having his shoulders and neck massaged by TWIN YOBANAS, is SEBULBA.

WATTO: Don't get me wrongo. I have great faith in the boy. He's a credit to your race, but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.

WATTO flies over to where SEBULBA is getting a massage as JAR JAR's eyes bug out in shock.

JAR JAR: Oh-no!

QUI-GON: Why do you think that?

WATTO: He always wins. (laughs) I'm betting heavily on Sebulba.

QUI-GON: I'll take that bet.

WATTO: (suddenly stops laughing) You'll what??!!

QUI-GON: I'll wager my new racing pod against... say... the boy and his mother.

WATTO: No Pod's worth two slaves ... not by a long shot.

QUI-GON: The boy, then ...

WATTO thinks a bit as JAR JAR looks around.

WATTO: We'll let fate decide, huh. I just happen to have a chance cube here. Blue it's the boy, red his mother...

WATTO tosses the cube down. QUI-GON lifts his hand slightly; it turns blue. QUI-GON smiles. WATTO is angry.

WATTO: (Cont'd) You won the small toss, outlander, bou you won't win the race, so ... it makes little difference.

ANAKIN and PADME enter the hanger on one of the EOPIES, pulling an engine. KITSTER and SHMI, on the other EOPIE. With THREEPIO walking alongside, ARTOO trundles behind, pulling the Pod. WATTO flies off, laughing. He passes ANAKIN as he leaves.

WATTO: (subtitled) Ouna bakeesa. Bonapa keesa pateeso, o wanna meetee chobodd. (Better stop your friends betting or I'll end up owning him too.)

ANAKIN: What'd he mean by that?

QUI-GON: I'll tell you later. Goodmorning.

QUI-GON walks over to where SHMI is seated on the EOPIE and helps her down.

ARTOO beeps at THREEPIO.

THREEPIO: Oh my! Space travel sounds rather perilous.

ARTOO emits a series of beeps.

THREEPIO: I can assure you they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships!

KITSTER: (to Anakin) This is so wizard Ani! I'm sure you'll do it this time.

PADME: Do what?

KITSTER: Finish the race, of course!

PADME: You've never won a race?

ANAKIN: Well... not exactly...

PADME: Not even finished?!

ANAKN looks sheepish.

ANAKIN: ... Kitster's right, I will this time.

QUI-GON: Of course you will.

QUI-GON and PADME look at eachother. PADME is concerned.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - DAY

JAR JAR is standing near an EOPIE who makes a stink.

JAR JAR: Peeusa!

Behind JAR JAR, SEBULBA comes up to ANAKINS pod engines and disconnects something, laughing. He continues to walk toward the cockpit where ANAKIN contines to connect things.

SEBULBA: Bazda wahota, shag. Dobiella Nok. (You won't walk away from this one, Skywalker. You slave scum.)

ANAKIN: (subtitled) Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo. (Don't count on it, slime-ball.)

ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare.

SEBULBA: (subtitled) Yoka to Bantha poodoo. (You're bantha fodder!)

SEBULBA walks away as QUI-GON walks up.

QUI-GON: You all set, Ani?

ANAKIN: Yep.

QUI-GON: All right.

QUI-GON picks him up and sets him down in the racer.

QUI-GON: Remember, concentrate on the moment. Feel. Don't think. Use your instincts.

ANAKIN: I will.

QUI-GON: (cont'd) May the Force be with you.

QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his helmet and goggles.

The powerful energy binders of the various pods ignite and engines roar.

EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

SHMI looks nervously to QUI-GON as he enters a veiwing platform. PADME and JAR JAR are already on board. The platform rises like an elevator.

SHMI: Is he nervous?

QUI-GON: He's fine.

PADME: You Jedi are far too reckless. The Queen is not...

QUI-GON: The Queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden. You should too.

On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center flashes. The Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches scream.

ANAKIN'S engine floods and coughs - then dies. All the other Podracers except one swerve around him and dissapear down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer started. The two-headed announcer reports.

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

QUADRINAROS pounds on his dashboard in frustration.

JAR JAR: C'mon Ani!

Finally, Anakin's engines ignite. He zooms away after the receeding pack of competitors, leaving one quadra-Pod racer still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER describes the race as it progresses.

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

B: And there goes Skywalker...

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

B: (cont'd) He'll be hard pressed to catch up with the leaders.

EXT MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck and neck with MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the track, side by side. SEBULBA drives his Pod into his rival, forcing him into the wall of a large rock formation. MAWHONIC crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.

ANAKIN is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them easily.

One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN tries to pass him on one side and is cut off. He then tries to pass him on the other side ansd is cut off. As they come up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off, then guns it as GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast that he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.

Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their rifles at the Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot ricochets off the back of Anakin's Pod.

ARTOO, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried sigh. The driver of the quadra-Pod looks worried.

THREEPIO: Where is master Anakin?

ARTOO twitters something in response.

EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the landscape for any sign of the racers.

PADME: Look, here he comes!

EXT MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining on the pack. The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd goes wild.

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

B: It looks like Skywalker is moving up in the field...

ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and PADME is unbearable.

EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - PIT AREA - DAY (FX)

KITSTER and WALD cheer as ANAKIN passes.

ARTOO lets out an excited whistle.

THREEPIO: He has to complete two more circuits? Oh dear!

Lap two. SEBULBA and the pack race past the main arena. The crowd stands and YELLS as the Podracers scream off into the distance.

EXT MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs, passing other racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead. He is being challenged by another racer, XELBREE.

SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he opens a side vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts to cut through the alien's engine.

The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES. SEBULBA deftly veers away.

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

B: Oh, I don't care what universe you're from, that's gotta hurt.

ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they zoom over a dune sea, kicking up dust. His Pod shakes violently as he goes over a jump. Tusken Raiders continue to shoot at the podracers. One of the Podracers, ODY, is hit by a blaster bolt and the whole thing EXPLODES.

EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY

QUI-GON, SHMI, PADME and JAR JAR continue to look fo ANAKIN.

JAR JAR: Here he comes, yahoo!

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

B: At the start of the third and final lap, Sebulba is in the lead, closely followed by Skywalker...

ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and neck over the rough terrain. JAR JAR, QUI-GON, SHMI, and PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes through the arena.

EXT MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)

SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through Anakin's engines. ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is forced off course.

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

B: Skywalker's been forced onto the service ramp!

On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the lead.

FODE BEED: (O.S.)

B: It's Skywalker!

The crowd goes wild.

FODE BEED: (O.S.)

B: (cont'd) Amazing... a quick controlled thrust and he's back on course!

JAR JAR: Did he crashed?

SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on Anakin's tail, crowding him and pushing him through the turns. SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a difficult time keeping control.

Two JAWA are watching from a distance.

One of the parts on Anakin's engines begins to shake loose.

FODE BEED: (O.S.)

B: Skywalker's in trouble. Sebulba takes the lead.

ANAKIN sees the problem and switches over to an auxiliary system. While he is trying to accomplish this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.

ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move ANAKIN makes, SEBULBA is able to block.

Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually does, then tries to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They race side by side down the final stretch of the track.

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

B: He's catching Sebulba.

A: Inkabunga.

JAR JAR: Careful, Ani, careful, Ani!

SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes into ANAKIN over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain control as the steering rods on the two Pods become hooked together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.

FODE/BEED: (O.S.)

B: That little human being is out of his mind.

A: Punda tah punda!

B: They're side by side!

A: Bongo du bongu!

As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock the steering rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The strain on the steering rod is tremendous. The release of tension sends SEBULBA into a spin as he crashes. One engine EXPLODES, then the other. SEBULBA skids and slides to a smoking stop. He slams his fists against his pod in discust.

SEBULBA: Poodu!

ANAKIN flies by as the crowd stands, CHERRING. QUI-GON, SHMI and PADME smile. JAR JAR gets excited. WALD and KITSTER jump up and down in excitment. ARTOO whistles hysterically.

THREEPIO: I can't believe it.

ANAKIN races over the finish line, the winner.

INT MOS ESPA - ARENA ANNOUNCERS BOX - DAY (FX)

The two-headed announcer excitedly calls the finish.

FODE/BEED:

EXT MOS ESPA - ARENA - DAY

As ANAKIN stops the Podracer, KITSTER turns up, and they embrace. Hundreds of SPECTATORS join them and put ANAKIN on their shoulders, marching off, CHEERING AND CHANTING. QUI-GON, SHMI, PADME and JAR JAR rush over to him.

ANAKIN: Mom! I did it! Yeah!

Then PADME gives him a hug.

PADME: We owe you everything, Ani.

Then SHMI gives him a kiss.

SHMI: It's so wonderful, Ani. You have brought hope to those who have none. I'm so very proud of you...

ANAKIN: Ah...

INT MOS ESPA - ARENA - PRIVATE BOX - DAY

WATTO sees QUI-GON standing in the doorway.

WATTO: You! You swindled me! You knew the boy was going to win! Somehow you knew it! I lost everything.

WATTO flies up to QUI-GON and puts his face right up against QUI-GON's. QUI-GON simply smiles.

QUI-GON: Whenever you gamble, my friend, eventually you'll lose. Bring the parts to the main hanger. I'll come by your shop later so you can release the boy.

WATTO: You can't have him! It wasn't a fair bet!

QUI-GON: Would you like to discuss it with the Hutts ... I'm sure they can settle this.

WATTO: Take him!

QUI-GON nods and starts to leave.

EXT TATOOINE - DESERT - NABOO SPACECRAFT - DAY

ARTOO cruises ahead of QUI-GON and PADME, who are riding one of the EOPIES; JAR JAR rides the other. They stop in front of the sleek Naboo spacecraft. OBI-WAN comes out of the ship and joins them.

QUI-GON: Well, we have all the essential parts we need. I'm going back...some unfinished business. I won't be long.

OBI-WAN: Why do I sense we've picked up another pathetic life form...?

QUI-GON: It's the boy who's responsible for getting those parts. Get this hyperdrive generator installed.

OBI-WAN: Yes, Master. It shouldn't take long.

QUI-GON turns and rides back to town on the EOPIE.

EXT TATOOINE - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

SHMI is cleaning up as ANAKIN bursts through the door, followed by QUI-GON.

ANAKIN: Mom, he sold the Pod. Look at all the money we have!

ANAKIN pulls a bag of coins out of his pocket.

SHMI: Oh, my goodness, That's wonderful Ani.

QUI-GON: And Anakin has been freed.

ANAKIN: What?!?

QUI-GON: You're no longer a slave.

ANAKIN: Did you hear that?

SHMI: Now you can make your dreams come true, Annie. You're free! (turns to Qui-Gon) Will you take him with you? Is he to become a Jedi?

QUI-GON: Yes. Our meeting was not a coincidence. Nothing happens by accident.

ANAKIN: You mean I get to come with you in your starship?!

QUI-GON kneels down to the boy.

QUI-GON: Anakin, training to become a Jedi is not be a easy challenge. And if you succeed, it's a hard life.

ANAKIN: But I want to go. It's what I've always dreamed of doing. Can I go, Mom?!

SHMI: Anakin, this path has been placed for you; the choice is yours alone.

ANAKIN thinks a bit as he looks to his mother.

ANAKIN: I want to do it.

QUI-GON: Then, pack your things. We haven't much time.

ANAKIN: Yipee!!

ANAKIN hugs his mom and starts for the other room, then stops. ANAKIN has realized something.

ANAKIN: (Cont'd) What about Mom? Is she free too?

QUI-GON: I tried to free your mother, Ani, but Watto wouldn't have it.

ANAKIN: You're coming, aren't you, Mom?

SHMI: Son, my place is here. My future is here. It is time for you to let go...

ANAKIN: I don't want things to change.

SHMI: But you can't stop change any more than you can stop the suns from setting. Now... hurry.

ANAKIN and SHMI hug. ANAKIN runs into the other room.

SHMI: (Cont'd) Thank you.

QUI-GON: I'll watch after him. You have my word. Will you be all right?

INT ANAKIN'S HOVEL - BEDROOM - DAY

ANAKIN hurries to throw the last of his things into his backpack. He walks over and pushes the button on the droid to wake him up. THREEPIO stares at him blankly.

THREEPIO: Oh! Oh my, oh. Hello Master Anakin.

ANAKIN: Well, Threepio, I'm free ... and I'm going away ... in a starship ...

THREEPIO: Master, Annie, you are my maker, and I wish you well. However, I should prefer it if I were a little more... comepleted.

ANAKIN: I'm sorry I wasn't able to finish you, Threepio ... give you coverings and all ... I'm going to miss working on you. You've been a great pal. I'll make sure Mom doesn't sell you or anything.

THREEPIO stares at ANAKIN as he rushes out of the room.

THREEPIO: Sell me?!?

ANAKIN: Bye.

EXT MOS ESPA - STREET - SLAVE QUARTERS - DAY

QUI-GON and ANAKIN exit the hovel. SHMI stands in the doorway. QUI-GON and ANAKIN start to walk down the street, then ANAKIN stops to look back at his mother standing in the doorway. He turns back to QUI-GON, then turns and runs back to his mother. SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She kneels down and looks him in the face.

ANAKIN: (starting to cry) I can't do it, Mom. I just can't do it.

SHMI: Annie...

ANAKIN: Will I ever see you again?

SHMI: What does your heart tell you?

ANAKIN: I hope so... yes... I guess.

SHMI: Then we will see each other again.

ANAKIN: I will come back and free you, Mom... I promise.

SHMI: Now be brave, and don't look back... don't look back.

SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-GON, and off he marches, like the brave little trooper that he is. He marches right past QUI-GON, starring right ahead, tears in his eyes, determined not to look back.

QUI-GON turns to answer and sees a DARK-CLOAKED FIGURE bearing down on a speeder bike.

QUI-GON: Anakin, drop!

ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over him. DARTH MAUL jumps off his speeder bike, and before he has hit the ground, the Sith Lord has swund a death blow with his laser sword that is barely blocked by QUI-GON.

ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and Jedi, are bashing each other with incredible blows. They move in a continual cloudof dust, smashing everything around them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets up, bewildered by the confrontation.

QUI-GON: (Cont'd) Annie, tell them to take off!

QUI-GON struggles to fend off the relentless onslaught as ANAKIN races to the ship.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN come through the door.

ANAKIN: Are you all right?

QUI-GON: I think so.

OBI-WAN: What was it?

QUI-GON: I'm not sure... but he was well trained in the Jedi arts. My guess is he was after the Queen...

ANAKIN: What are we going to do about it?

OBI-WAN gives ANAKIN a "who are you?" look. ANAKIN returns an innocent stare.

QUI-GON: We will be patient. Anakin Skywalker, meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.

ANAKIN: Hi. You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.

NUTE: Your Queen is lost, your people are starving, and you, Governor, are going to die, much sooner than your people, I'm afraid.

BIBBLE: This invasion will gain you nothing. We're a democracy. The people have decided...

NUTE: Take him away.

BIBBLE is taken away as OOM-9 approaches NUTE.

The ship is asleep. The lights are dim as PADME walks into the main room. She goes to a monitor and watches the BIBBLE plea recording. JAR JAR is stretched out in a chair, snoring. ARTOO is to one side, cooing as he rests.

PADME appears tired. She senses someone watching her and turns around with a start. She sees ANAKIN sitting in the corner, shivering and looking very dejected.

PADME: Are you all right?

ANAKIN: It's very cold.

She goes over to him. He looks up at her with tears in his eyes. He is holding his arms to keep himself warm. PADME gives him her over-jacket.

PADME: You come from a warm planet, Annie. A little too warm for my taste. Space is cold.

ANAKIN: You seem sad.

PADME: The Queen is... worried. Her people are suffering... dying. She must convince the Senate to intervene, I'm not sure what will happen.

ANAKIN: (he pulls something from his pocket) I made this for you. So you'd remember me. I carved it out of a japor snippet... It will bring you good fortune.

ANAKIN hands a wooden pendant to PADME. She inspects it, then puts it around her neck.

PADME: It's beautiful, but I don't need this to remember you by. Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani. My caring for you will remain.

ANAKIN: I care for you too. Only I...

ANAKIN is disturbed about something. Tears are in his eyes.

CAPTAIN PANAKA, TWO GUARDS, QUEEN AMIDALA, then PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and MORE GUARDS descend the ramp. QUEEN AMIDALA stops before the group.ANAKIN and JAR JAR stand to one side, looking at the huge city. PADME smiles at ANAKIN. PALPATINE bows before the Queen.

PALPATINE: It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty. With the communications breakdown, we've become very concerned. I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation. May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.

VALORUM: Welcome, Your Highness. It's an honor to finally meet you in person.

AMIDALA: Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.

VALORUM: (cont'd) I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the currant situation. I've called for a special session of the Senate to hear your position.

AMIDALA: I am grateful for your concern, Chancellor.

PALPATINE starts to lead QUEEN AMIDALA and her RETINUE off the platform toward a waiting air taxi.

PALPATINE: There is a question of precedure, but I feel confident we can overcome it...

JAR JAR and ANAKIN follow the QUEEN, PALPATINE, PADME, RABE and EIRTAE to the taxi.

PALPATINE: ...the Republic is not what it once was. The Senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates. There is no interest in the common good. I must be frank, Your Majesty, there is little chance the Senate will act on the invasion.

AMIDALA: Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.

PALPATINE: If I may say so, Your Majesty, the Chancellor has little real power... he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption. The bureaucrats are in charge now.

AMIDALA: What options have we?

PALPATINE: Our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger Supreme Chancellor. One who will take control of the bureaucrats, and give us justice. You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.

AMIDALA: He has been our strongest supporter?

PALPATINE: Our only other choice would to be to submit a plea to the courts...

AMIDALA: The courts take even longer to decide things than the Senate. Our people are dying, Senator... We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.

PALPATINE: To be realistic, Your Majesty, I think we're going to have to accept Federation control for the time being.

QUI-GON: ... He was trained in the Jedi arts. My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith Lord.

KI-ADI: Impossible! The Sith have been extinct for a millenium.

MACE WINDU: I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing.

YODA: Ah, hard to see, the dark side is.

MACE WINDU: We will use all our resources here to unravel this mystery and discover the identity of your attacker... May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN turns and leaves, but QUI-GON continues to face the Council.

YODA: (Cont'd) Master Qui-Gon more to say have you?

QUI-GON: With your permission, my Master. I have encountered a vergence in the Force.

YODA: A vergence, you say?

MACE WINDU: Located around a person?

QUI-GON: A boy... his cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians I have ever seen in a life form. It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians.

MACE WINDU: You're referring to the prophesy of the one who will bring balance to the Force... you believe it's this boy??

QUI-GON: I don't presume...

YODA: But you do! Revealed your opinion is.

QUI-GON: I request the boy be tested, Master.

The JEDI all look to one another. They nod and turn back to OBI-WAN and QUI-GON.

Anakin, tentative, walks down one of the long hallways in Senator Palpatine's quarters. He stops before a door that is flanked by a GUARD.

The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a bit nervously.

GUARD: The boy is here to see Padme.

RABE: (v.o.) Let him in.

The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.

RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into the next room.

RABE: Anakin Skywalker, to see Padme, Your Highness.

The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN bows and looks down, then takes a peek at her.

ANAKIN: I'm on my way to the Jedi temple to start my training, I hope.

The QUEEN just stares at him.

The Senate chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their AIDES sit in the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM sits in an elevated area in the center. SENATOR PALPATINE, QUEEN AMIDALA, EIRTA, RABE, and CAPTAIN PANAKA sit in the Naboo congressional box, which is actually a floating platform.

VALORUM: The Chair recognizes the Senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.

The Naboo congressional box floats into the center.

PALPATINE: Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the Senate. A tragedy has occurred which started with the taxation of trade routes, and has now engulfed our entire planet in the oppression of the Trade Federation.

A second box rushes into the center of the Senate. It is filled with Federation trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the Senator for the Federation.

LOTT DOD: This is outrageous! I object to the Senator's statements!

VALORUM: The Chair does not recognize the Senator from the Trade Federation at this time. Please return to your station.

LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.

PALPATINE: To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala, recently elected ruler of Naboo, who speaks on our behalf.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is some applause.

AMIDALA: Honorable representatives of the Republic, I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade...

LOTT DOD: I object! There is no proof. This is incredible. We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.

A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of the room. AKS MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.

AKS MOE: The Congress of Malastare concurs with the honorable delegate from the Trade Federation. A commission must be appointed.

VALORUM: The point...

VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN MAS AMEDDA. PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.

PALPATINE: Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers of the Republic, and on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add. This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will dissapear.

VALORUM: The point is conceded ... will you defer your motion to allow a commission to explore the validity of your accusations?

QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.

AMIDALA: (angrily) I will not defer... I have come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now. I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die while you discuss this invasion in a committee. If this body is not capable of action, I suggest new leadership is needed... I move for a "vote of no confidence"... in Chancellor Valorum's leadership.

This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud murmur cresendos into a roar of approval and jeers.

ASSEMBLY: Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!

CHANCELLOR VALORUM is stunned and stands back, speechless. His Vice Chair, MAS AMEDDA, takes over.

MAS AMEDDA: Order!

Things settledown a little. The Federation box settles next to AMIDALA.

PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.

PALPATINE: Now they will elect a new Chancellor, a strong Chancellor, one who will not let our tragedy continue...

OBI-WAN: If you would just follow the code you would be on the council. They will not go along with you this time.

QUI-GON: You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.

INT PALACE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - SUNSET

ANAKIN stands before the TWELVE JEDI. MACE WINDU holds a small hand-held viewing screen. In rapid succession, images flash across the screen.

ANAKIN: A ship... a cup... a ship... a speeder.

MACE WINDU turns the viewing screen off and nods toward YODA.

YODA: Hmm... how feel you?

ANAKIN: Cold, sir.

YODA: Afraid are you?

ANAKIN: No, sir.

YODA: See through you, we can.

MACE WINDU: Be mindful of your feelings...

KI-ADI: Your thoughts dwell on your mother.

ANAKIN: I miss her.

YODA: Afraid to lose her... I think, hmm?

ANAKIN: (a little angry) What's that got to do with anything?

YODA: Everything. Fear is the path to the dark side... fear leads to anger... anger leads to hate.. hate leads to suffering... I sense much fear in you.

INT PALPATINES QUARTERS - SUNSET

QUEEN AMIDALA is standing, staring out the window, with JAR JAR. The lights of the city shimmer before them. EIRTAE and SABE stand near the door. JAR JAR turns to face the QUEEN and sees her sadness.

JAR JAR: Yousa tinken yousa people ganna die?

AMIDALA: I don't know.

JAR JAR: Gungans get pasted too, eh?

AMIDALA: I hope not.

JAR JAR: Gungans no die'n without a fight... wesa warriors. Wesa gotta grand army. Dat why yousa no liken us, mesatinks.

PALPATINE and CAPTAIN PANAKA rush into the room and bow before the QUEEN.

CAPT. PANAKA: Your Highness? Your Highness, Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum as Supreme Chancellor.

PALPATINE: A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one. Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise put an end to corruption.

AMIDALA: Who else can be nominated?

CAPT. PANAKA: Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ailee Teem of Malastare.

PALPATINE: I feel confident ... our "situation" will create a strong sympathy vote for us ... I will be Chancellor.

AMIDALA: I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator, there will be nothing left of our our people, our way of life...

PALPATINE: I understand your concern, Your Majesty; unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet.

AMIDALA: Senator, this is your arena. I feel I must return to mine. I've decided to go back to Naboo.

PALPATINE: Go back!! But, Your Majesty, be realistic! They'll force you to sign the treaty.

AMIDALA: I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different from that of our people. Captain!

CAPT. PANAKA: Your Highness?

AMIDALA: Ready my ship!

CAPT. PANAKA: Please, Your Majesty, stay here... where it's safe.

AMIDALA: It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions. I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the Senate.

AMIDALA and her RETINUE exit the room. PALPATINE is strieght-faced.

INT TEMPLE OF THE JEDI - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - TWILIGHT

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON stand before the TWELVE MEMBERS OF THE JEDI COUNCIL.

KI-ADI: The Force is strong with him.

QUI-GON: He's to be trained, then?

The COUNCIL MEMBERS look to one another.

MACE WINDU: No. He will not be trained.

ANAKIN is crestfallen and stares at MACE.

MACE WINDU: He is too old.

QUI-GON: He is the chosen one... you must see it.

YODA: Clouded, this boy's future is.

QUI-GON: I will train him, then. I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.

OBI-WAN reacts with surprise. ANAKIN watches with interest.

YODA: An apprentice, you have, Qui-Gon. Impossible, to take on a second.

MACE WINDU: The code forbids it.

QUI-GON: Obi-Wan is ready...

OBI-WAN: I am ready to face the trials.

YODA: Our own council we will keep on who is ready.

QUI-GON: He is headstrong and he has much to learn of the living Force, but he is capable. There is little more he can learn from me.

YODA: Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.

MACE WINDU: Now is not the time for this... the Senate is voting for a new Supreme Chancellor and Queen Amidala is returning home, which will put pressure on the Federation, and could widen the confrontation.

KI-ADI: And draw out the Queen's attacker.

MACE WINDU: Go with the Queen to Naboo and discover the identity of the dark warrior. That is the clue we need to unravel this mystery of the Sith.

YODA: May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, and ANAKIN bow then leave.

EXT CORUSCANT - SENATE LANDING PLATFORM - NIGHT

QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, and ANAKIN stand on the landing platform outside the ship. ARTOO whistles a happy tune. The wind whips at ANAKIN as he listens to the JEDI.

OBI-WAN: It is not disrespect, Master, it is the truth.

QUI-GON: From your point of view....

OBI-WAN: The boy is dangerous... they all sense it. Why can't you?

QUI-GON: His fate is uncertain, he's not dangerous. The Council will decide Anakin's future... that should be enough for you. Now get on board!

OBI-WAN reluctantly boards the Naboo spacecraft. QUI-GON goes over to ANAKIN who is standing next to ARTOO.

ANAKIN: Master Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.

QUI-GON: You won't be, Ani... I'm not allowed to train you, so I want you to watch me and be mindful...

ARTOO turns and rolls over to the edge of the platform watching the trafic.

QUI-GON: (cont'd) ... always remember, your focus determines your reality. Stay close to me and you will be safe.

ANAKIN: Master, sir... I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians. I've been wondering, what are midi-chlorians?

QUI-GON: Midi-chlorians are a microcopic lifeform that reside within all living cells.

ANAKIN: They live inside of me?

QUI-GON: In your cells, yes... and we are symbionts with them.

ANAKIN: Symbionts?

QUI-GON: Life forms living together for mutual advantage. Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist, and we would have no knowledge of the Force. They continually speak to us, telling us the will of the Force. When you learn to quiet your mind, you will hear them speaking to you.

ANAKIN: I don't understand.

QUI-GON: With time and training, Ani... you will... you will.

Two taxis pull up, and CAPTAIN PANAKA, QUEEN AMIDALA, and her HANDMAIDENS stop before the JEDI.

QUI-GON: (Cont'd) Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.

AMIDALA: I welcome your help. Senator Palpatine fears the Federation means to destroy me.

QUI-GON: I assure you, I will not let that happen.

AMIDALA enters the ship, followed by her HANDMAIDENS. JAR JAR hugs QUI-GON and ANAKIN.

JAR JAR: Wesa goen home!

ANAKIN: C'mon, Artoo.

They ALL move onto the ship. The ship takes off.

NUTE and RUNE stand before a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Is the planet secure?

NUTE: We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life forms. We are in complete control of the planet now.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Good. I will see to it that in the Senate, things stay as they are. I'm sending my apprentice, Darth Maul, to join you.

NUTE: Yes, my Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades off.

RUNE: A Sith Lord here?!!

RIC OLIE: You catch on pretty quick.

INT NABOO SPACECRAFT - QUEEN'S CHAMBERS

SABE and EIRTAE stand behind QUEEN AMIDALA as she talks with QUI-GON and CAPTAIN PANAKA. OBI-WAN and JAR JAR watch.

CAPT. PANAKA: As soon as we land the Federation will arrest you, and force you to sign the treaty.

QUI-GON: I agree... I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this.

AMIDALA: I will take back what's ours.

CAPT. PANAKA: There are too few of us, Your Highness.... we have no army.

QUI-GON: And I can only protect you. I cannot fight a war for you.

AMIDALA: Jar Jar Binks!

JAR JAR looks around, puzzled.

JAR JAR: Mesa, Your Highness?

AMIDALA: Yes. I need your help.

INT NABOO CRUISER COCKPIT - DAY

The Naboo Cruiser heads toward the lush green planet. There is only one Federation battle cruiser orbiting. OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA spot it on the view screen.

RIC OLIE: I have one battleship on my scope.

OBI-WAN: It's a droid control ship.

PANAKA: They've probably spotted us.

The Naboo spacecraft has landed in the Gungan swamp. TROOPS unload the ships in the background as OBI-WAN approaches QUI-GON.

OBI-WAN: Jar Jar is on his way to the Gungan city, Master.

QUI-GON's thoughts are elsewhere.

QUI-GON: Good.

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON stand silently for a moment.

OBI-WAN: Do you think the Queen's idea will work?

QUI-GON: The Gungans will not easily be swayed, and we cannot use our power to help her.

OBI-WAN: I'm... I'm sorry for my behavior, Master. It is not my place to disagree with you about the boy... and I am grateful you think I am ready to take the trials.

QUI-GON looks at him for a long moment.

QUI-GON: You've been a good apprentice, Obi-Wan, and you're a much wiser man than I am. I foresee you will become a great Jedi Knight.

EXT NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY

JAR JAR exits the swamp lake and walks over to CAPTAIN PANAKA, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON. QUEEN AMIDALA, PADME, EIRTAE, RABE, ANAKIN, ARTOO, FOUR PILOTS, and EIGHT GUARDS stand in the background near the starship.

JAR JAR: Dare-sa nobody dare. Da Gungan city is diserted. Some kinda fight, mesa tinks.

OBI-WAN: Do you think they have been taken to camps?

CAPT. PANAKA: More likely they were wiped out.

JAR JAR: Mesa no tink so.

QUI-GON: Do you know where they are, Jar Jar?

JAR JAR: When in trouble, Gungans go to sacred place. Mesa show you. C'mon, mesa show you.

EXT NABOO SWAMP - DAY

The GROUP follows JAR JAR as he moves through the swamp. JAR JAR stops and sniffs the air. The GROUP stop behind him.

EXT NABOO SACRED TEMPLE RUINS - DAY

JAR JAR, QUEEN AMIDALA, ANAKIN, ARTOO, QUI-GON, OBI-WAN, PADME, RABE, EIRTAE, and the rest of her group are led through a clearing full of GUNGAN refugees. At the far end are the ruins of a grand temple with massive carved heads. BOSS NASS and several other COUNCIL MEMBERS walk out on the top of a three-quarter-submerged head.

CAPT. TARPALS: You Honor, Queen Amidala of the Naboo.

JAR JAR: Ah, ello dare, ye big Boss Nass, You Honor.

BOSS NASS: Jar Jar Binks, who's da uss-en others??

QUEEN AMIDALA steps forward. CAPTAIN PANAKA and the JEDI stand behind her.

AMIDALA: I am Queen Amidala of the Naboo... I come before you in peace.

BOSS NASS: Ah, Naboo biggen. Yousa bringen da Mackineeks... Yousa all bombad.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HALF A DOZEN GUARDS and PILOTS look around nervously, and the GUNGAN TROOPS lower their long power poles. The JEDI stay relaxed. ANAKIN watches everything with great interest.

AMIDALA: We have searched you out 'cause we wish to form an alliance...

Suddenly, PADME steps forward.

PADME: Your Honor...

BOSS NASS: Whosa dis?

PADME: I am Queen Amidala.

JAR JAR and ANAKIN are stunned.

PADME: (points to Queen) This is my decoy... my protection... my loyal bodyguard.

OBI-WAN and QUI-GON give each other a knowing look.

PADME: (Cont'd) ... I am sorry for my deception, but it was necessary to protect myself. Although we do not always agree, Your Honor, our two great societies have always lived in peace. The Trade Federation has destroyed all that we have worked so hard to build. If we do not act quickly, all will be lost forever... I ask you to help us... (PADME drops to her knees before the GUNGANS.)... no, I beg you to help us. We are your humble servants...

There is a gasp from CAPTAIN PANAKA, HIS TROOPS, and the HANDMAIDENS.

PADME: (Cont'd) ... Our fate is in your hands.

Slowly, CAPTAIN PANAKA and his TROOPS bow down before the GUNGAN COUNCIL. Then the HANDMAIDENS, ANAKIN, and finally the JEDI. The GUNGANS are puzzled by this. BOSS NASS begins to laugh.

BOSS NASS: Yousa no tinken yousa greater den da Gungans.. Mesa like dis.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN smile at each other.

BOSS NASS: (cont'd) Maybe wesa bein friends.

PADME and the others start to smile and laugh at the situation.

NUTE: ... we've sent out patrols. We've already located their starship in the swamp... It won't be long, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS: This is an unexpected move for her. It's too aggressive... Lord Maul, be mindful. Let them make the first move.

DARTH MAUL: Yes, my Master.

EXT NABOO EDGE OF SWAMP/ GRASS PLAINS - DAY

A GUNGAN SENTRY sits on top of the ancient temple heah, searching the landscape with a pair of electrobinoculars. He sees something and yells down to ANAKIN at the foot of the statue.

GUNGAN LOOKOUT: Daza comen!

ANAKIN: All right...

ANAKIN yells and runs over to PADME and the JEDI, who are discussing a battle plan with FIVE GUNGAN GENERALS.

ANAKIN: (cont'd) ... They're here.

PADME: Good, they made it.

THREE SPEEDERS pull up to the GROUP. CAPTAIN PANAKA and a DOZEN OR SO GUARDS and PILOTS pile out and join the group.

BOSS NASS puts his arm around JAR JAR.

BOSS NASS: Yousa doen grand. Jar Jar bringen usen an da Naboo together.

JAR JAR: Oh, no, no, no...

BOSS NASS: So, wesa make yous Bombad General.

JAR JAR: General??! Oh, no..

JAR JAR's eyes roll back, his tongue flops out and he faints.

BOSS NASS laughs and walks over to where CAPTAIN PANAKA is talking with PADME and the JEDI.

PADME: What is the situation?

CAPT. PANAKA: Almost everyone's in camps. A few hundred police and guards have formed an underground resistance movement. I brought back as many of the leaders as I could. The Federation Army's also much larger than we thought, and much stronger. Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think we can win.

PADME: The battle is a diversion. The Gungans must draw the Droid Army away from the cities. (to Artoo) Artoo, we can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side. Once we get to the main entrance, Captain Panaka will create a diversion. Then we can enter the palace and capture the Viceroy. Without the Viceroy, they will be lost and confused.

QUI-GON and OBI-WAN look on with interest.

PADME: (Cont'd) What do you think, Master Jedi?

QUI-GON: The Viceroy will be well guarded.

CAPT. PANAKA: The difficulty's getting into the throne room. Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.

QUI-GON: There is a possibility, with this diversion many, Gungans will be killed.

BOSS NASS: Wesa ready to do are-sa part.

ANAKIN watches with interest.

PADME: We have a plan which should immobilize the Droid Army. We will send what pilots we have to knock out the Droid control ship orbiting the planet.

QUI-GON: A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk. The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields.

OBI-WAN: And there's an even bigger danger. If the Viceroy escapes, Your Highness, he will return with another droid army.

PADME: Well that is why we must not fail to get to the Viceroy. Everything depends on it.

INT THEED - PALACE - THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, DARTH MAUL, OOM-9, and a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS walk through the throne room.

DARTH SIDIOUS: ... she is more foolish than I thought.

NUTE: We are sending more troops to meet this army assembling in the swamp. It appears to be made up of primitives.

DARTH SIDIOUS: This will work to our advantage.

NUTE: I have your approval to proceed then, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Wipe them out... all of them.

INT NABOO SWAMP LAKE - DAY (FX)

All is peaceful. Suddenly there is a disturbance in the middle of the lake. A rush of bubbles, then a GUNGAN SOLDIER riding a KAADU emerges from the fog, followed by SEVERAL OTHERS.

SOLDIERS on huge, lizard-like FAMBAAS with large shield generators mounted on their backs follow the marching WARRIORS.

The GUNGAN ARMY heads out of the swamp and onto the rolling grassy hills. HUNDREDS OF GUNGAN WARRIORS march in lon lines toward the horizon.

The GUNGAN, GENERAL CEEL, sees the tanks on the ridge and orders a halt. The GUNGANS are spread out in a large line. JAR JAR is nervous.

GENERAL CEEL signals to the shield operators.

GENERAL CEEL: Halt! Starten up the shield.

A red ray shoots out of the generator and blasts into a large dish on the back of a second FAMBAA and spreads like an umbrella over the assembled WARRIORS.

Federation tanks move up to a ridge and stop. In the distance they see the GUNGAN ARMY waiting for them.

BATTLE DROID CAPT.: Pull 'em forward.

The Federation tanks fire upon the GUNGAN army hitting thier shields.

EXT THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

PADME, followed by EIRTAE, OBI-WAN, QUI-GON, ANAKIN, and ARTOO, stealthily makes her way toward the entrance to the main hanger. They are followed by about TWENTY NABOO GUARDS, PILOTS, and TROOPS. They stop, and PADME uses a small red laser light to signal across the plaza to CAPTAIN PANAKA, RABE and TWENTY OTHER ASSORTED NABOO TROOPS. They signal back. QUI-GON leans over to ANAKIN.

QUI-GON: Once we get inside, you find a safe place to hide and stay there.

ANAKIN: Sure.

QUI-GON points a stern finger at ANAKIN.

QUI-GON: (cont'd) Stay there!

DROID TROOPS mill about the tank-filled plaza. At the far end of the plaza, SEVERAL DROIDS begin to run and fire. NABOO SOLDIERS begin to fire back at the BATTLE DROIDS.

As the ruckus erupts at one end of the plaza, PADME and her TROOPS rush into the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS SOLDIERS continue to engage the DROIDS outside.

INT THEED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

NUTE, RUNE, and FOUR COUNCIL MEMBERS watch the plaza battle on a large view screen.

NUTE: I thought the battle was going to take place far from here... this is too close!

INT THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

QUI-GON: Ani, find cover, quick!

ANAKIN hides behind one of the Naboo fighters, ducking as large bolts whiz past and EXPLODE near him. PADME and the TWO JEDI destroy BATTLE DROIDS right and left. The QUEEN'S TROOPS and EIRTAE also blast away at the DROIDS. PADME signals to her pilots.

PADME: Get to your ships!

The PILOTS and ARTOO UNITS run for the Naboo fighter craft stacked in the hanger bay. 

The ship begins to levitate out of the hanger. BATTLE DROIDS fire at it as it falls in behind five other fighters. ARTOO whistles to ANAKIN from a fighter not far away. ANAKIN runs and jumps into the fighter to hide.

OOM-9: Cease fire!

The tanks stop firing, and the GUNGANS watch for a minute.

JAR JAR: (to the group) Steady, steady.

The GUNGANS continue to wait as they see the doors to the massive transports open, and racks of BATTLE DROIDS are pulled out and lined up.

The GUNGANS get ready for an attack by activating individual shields. The WARRIORS dump large balls of energy into thier catapults readying themselves for the impending battle.

The DROIDS slowly march through the protective shield and start firing.

CAPT. TARPALS: Fire!

The GUNGANS throw their power poles and fling small balls of energy with slingshots towards the DROIDS.

The KAADU JAR JAR is mounted on rears up an nocks JAR JAR to the ground.

JAR JAR and another GUNGAN pick up a few enegy balls and fling them towards the DROIDS. OOM-9 watches from a tank on a hill overlooking the battle.

INT THEED - CENTRAL HANGER - DAY

CAPTAIN PANAKA, SABE and NABOO TROOPS rush into the hanger and overwhelm the few remaining BATTLE DROIDS. PADME, OBI-WAN, and QUI-GON join forces with CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME: My guess is the Viceroy is in the throne room.

She looks to QUI-GON.

CAPT. PANAKA: Red Group, Blue Group, everybody, this way.

They start to head for the exit, on the way passing the fighter where ANAKIN is hiding. ARTOO whistles a greeting as ANAKIN peeps out of the cockpit.

ANAKIN: Hey! Wait for me.

QUI-GON: Anakin, stay where you are. You'll be safe there.

ANAKNI: But, I...

QUI-GON: Stay in that cockpit.

They head for the exit. As they are about to go through the door, suddenly everyone halts, revealing DARTH MAUL standing in the doorway. CAPTAIN PANAKA, PADME, and HER TROOPS back away. QUI-GON and OBI-WAN step forward.

QUI-GON: (Cont'd) We'll handle this...

PADME: We'll take the long way.

DARTH MAUL takes off his hood, and the TWO JEDI take off their capes.

At the far end of the hanger, THREE WHEEL DROIDS roll in and transform into their battle position. ARTOO calls ANAKIN's attention to the DROIDS.

PADME and HER TROOPS run for cover as they see the DESTROYER DROIDS.

ANAKIN: We've gotta do something, Artoo!

DARTH MAUL ignites his laser sword as the JEDI ignite theirs. Both ends of the sword light up.

The JEDI begin to fight the Sith Lord.

The DROIDS begin to advance and start firing on PADME and HER TROOPS.

ARTOO whistles a reply. Suddenly, the ship's systems go on, and the ship begins to levitate.

ANAKIN: I'm trying to. I don't know where the trigger is.

ANAKIN pushes a button, and the ship begins to roll towards the DROIDS.

ANAKIN: (Cont'd) Oops, wrong one.. Maybe this one....

ANAKIN pulls down on a lever and the hatch closes.

ANAKIN: No. Wait, here it is.

He pulls back on it and hits the button. The lasers begin to fire, wiping out all DESTROYER DROIDS.

PADME: Let's go!

ANAKIN: Ah... It's on automatic pilot.

ANAKIN's fighter flies toward the Federation Battleship.

EXT NABOO GRASS PALINS - DAY

A HALF DOZEN WHEEL DROIDS roll out toward the battle. They slowly roll through the deflector shields, then transform themselves once they get on the other side.

JAR JAR's clumsiness works for him in the battle. He falls off his KAADU and a DROID jumps on him. He drops the DROID and gets caught up in the DROIDS wiring, dragging the torso around with him, the DROID's gun firing randomly, accidentally blasting SEVERAL DROIDS in one process.

The GUNGANS blast the WHEEL DROIDS with energy balls. The DESTROYER DROIDS blast many GUNGANS.

He looks forward to see enemy ships approaching head on.

He moves the controls left and the ship responds, turning left.

ARTOO beeps

ANAKIN: (Cont'd) Go back!?! Qui-Gon told me to stay in this cockpit and that's what I'm gonna do.

An enemy fighter comes into his sights. ANAKIN pushes the controls and instead of firing, his fighter accelerates past the enemy ship.

Now the enemy ship is on his tail. He tries evasive maneuvers.

ANAKIN: (Cont'd) I'll try spinning, that's a good trick.

ANAKIN rolls the ship as ARTOO screams desperately.

Thin cables shoot out of the pistols and are embedded into the ledge. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and the OTHERS begin to climb up the wall. Once they reach the ledge they aim thier blasters at the window.

INT THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM

A window in the hallway blasts apart. PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER SOLDIERS climb into the hallway. They head for the door to the throne room.

INT THEED - POWER GENERATOR PIT - DAY

Three swords are crossed in an intense display of swordsmanship. The JEDI and the SITH LORD fight their way across the narrow bridge of the Theed power generator. The laser sword battle continues on the small catwalk around the vast power pit. DARTH MAUL kicks OBI-WAN off one of the ramps and he falls several levels. QUI-GON knocks the DARK LORD off another ramp, and he lands hard on a ramp two levels below. QUI-GON jumps down after him. The DARK LORD backs away along the catwalk into a small door. QUI-GON follows as OBI-WAN leaps up and runs to join QUI-GON in battle.

INT THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECTRON BEAM - HALLWAY

The SITH LORD, followed by QUI-GON, enters a long hallway filled with a series of deadly rays that go on and off in a pulsing pattern that shoots down the corridor every minute or so. DARTH MAUL makes it down several walls of deadly rays before they close. QUI-GON is one wall away from the DARK LORD. OBI-WAN is just starting into it and is five walls way from DARTH MAUL. The JEDI must wait until the next pulse to advance down the corridor. OBI-WAN is impatient and paces, waiting for the wall of rays to open. QUI-GON sits and meditates. DARTH MAUL hits the wall with the blade of his laser sword causing it to short out temporarily.

EXT NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

The GUNGAN ARMY is no match for the DESTROYER DROIDS. A DESTROYER DROID blasts one of the shield generators, causing it to EXPLODE. The protective shield begins to weaken and fall apart. The GUNGAN GENERAL signals a retreat as the tanks enter the battle.

The GUNGANS flee as fast as they can. JAR JAR mutters something in a panic as he runs for cover under a wagon.

JAR JAR: Dis is nuttsen.

The driver of the wagon starts to leave, uncovering JAR JAR.

JAR JAR: O, oh.

He attempts to escape on the wagon of energy balls but only manages to unhitch the back gate, causing all of the energy balls to roll out of the wagon and down the hill.

The GUNGANS renew their attack on the DROID ARMY. JAR JAR's bumbling destroys several more DESTROYER DROIDS. JAR JAR scrambles to avoid being hit by one of the balls. A TANK isn't so lucky.

JAR JAR: Hey, hey! Gimme a lift.

A GUNGANS riding by on a KAADU picks up JAR JAR.

An explosion hits the GUNGAN and JAR JAR is blown off his KAADU and lands on one of the tank guns. JAR JAR is scared.

CAPT. TARPALS: Ja Ja! Usen da booba!

JAR JAR: Wat! Mesa no have a booba.

CAPTAIN TARPALS pulls an energy ball out of his pouch.

CAPT. TARPALS: Here, taken dis one.

The GUNGAN throws JAR JAR an electric ball. JAR JAR struggles to catch it and it lands in the face of DROID in control of the tank.

The tank looses control and vears off to the left digging a path in the ground. JAR JAR struggles to hang on as he hangs from the cannon.

CAPTAIN TARPALS rides by on his KAADU.

CAPT. TARPALS: Ja Ja! Jump Ja Ja! Jump!

The TWO GUNGANS roll from the force of the fall and come to a stop amidst a FEW DOZEN BATTLE DROIDS.

INT THEED - PALACE - HALLWAY TO THRONE ROOM

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and HER SOLDIERS hurry toward the throne room. Suddenly, two DESTROYER DROIDS skitter in front of the door. PADME turns around and sees TWO MORE appear at the far end of the hallway, trapping them in the middle.

PADME throws down her pistol and turns to CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME: Throw down your weapons. They win this round.

CAPTAIN PANAKA and HIS MEN throw down their weapons.

A HALF DOZEN BATTLE DROIDS come up behind them.

INT NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

The battle rages on around ANAKIN's starfighter as he continues to spin.

ARTOO screams in protest.

ANAKIN: We're hit Artoo! Wah...!

ANAKIN's ship spins out of control into the hangar of the Federation Battleship.

INT NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ARTOO squeals in exclamation.

ANAKIN: I'm tring to stop. I'm tring to stop.

ANAKIN hits the reverse thrusters and the ship skids to a stop on the hanger deck. ARTOO gives out a worried whistle.

ANAKIN: (Cont'd) Everything's overheated.

ARTOO sees DROIDS approaching, and beeps frantically.

ANAKIN: Oops! This is not good.

ANAKIN sees the lights turn from green to red as he flips switches and presses buttons.

INT THEED - POWER GENERATOR ELECRIC BEAM - HALLWAY

When the wall between QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL opens, QUI-GON is in a split second fighting the DARK LORD with a ferocity not seen before. The wall of the deadly rays turn away, and OBI-WAN starts running toward QUI-GON and the DARK LORD. They move into the area at the end of the corridor called the melting pit, a small area that is mostly made up of a deep hole.

The electron ray gates begin to close. OBI-WAN tries to make it to the melting pit but is caught one gate short. He slides to a stop just before he hits the deadly electron field.

QUI-GON and DARTH MAUL battle around the melting pit as a frustrated OBI-WAN watches.

DARTH MAUL catches QUI-GON off guard. The SITH makes a quick move, bashes his lightsaber handle into QUI-GON's chin, and runs his lightsaber through his mid-section. QUI-GON slumps to the floor in a heap.

OBI-WAN: Noooo!

The SITH LORD withdrawls his lightsaber and turns and walks toward OBI-WAN who is still trapped by the electron ray wall.

EXT NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

The GUNGANS have been overrun. Some flee into the hills, chased by BATTLE DROIDS on STAPS. Many OTHERS are herded into groups by BATTLE DROIDS and DESTROYER DROIDS.

JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL are held in a small group with OTHER OFFICERS.

GENERAL CEEL: No given up General Ja Ja. Wesa tink of sometin.

BATTLE DROID CAPT.: Hands up!

JAR JAR: My giv up. My giv up.

GENERAL CEEL covers his eyes in shame shaking his head.

INT THED - PALACE THRONE ROOM - DAY

PADME, CAPTAIN PANAKA, and SIX OTHER OFFICERS are brought by TEN BATTLE DROIDS before NUTE and RUNE and FOUR NEIMOIDIAN COUNCIL MEMBERS.

NUTE: Your little insurrection is at an end, Your Highness. Time for you to sign the treaty... and end this pointless debate in the Senate.

SABE dressed like the Queen appears in the doorway with SEVERAL TROOPS. SEVERAL DESTROYED BATTLE DROIDS can be seen in the distance.

SABE: Viceroy, your occupation here has ended!

NUTE and THE OTHERS are stunned to see a SECOND QUEEN. NUTE yells at the TEN GUARDS in the room.

HER SOLDIERS shoot down to of the DROIDS in the room.

NUTE: After her! This one is a decoy!

SIX OF THE DROIDS rush out of the throne room after SABE.

PADME slumps down on her throne and immediately hits a security button that opens a panel in her desk opposite CAPTAIN PANAKA.

PADME grabs two pistols, tosses one of the to CAPTAIN PANAKA and one to an OFFICER. She takes a third pistol and BLASTS the last of the BATTLE DROIDS.

CAPT. PANAKA: (to his officers) Jam the doors!

The OFFICERS rush to the door control panel as PADME hits the switch to close the door. The OFFICER at the door jams the controls. CAPTAIN PANAKA throws more pistols to the OTHERS GUARDS. The NEIMODIANS are confused and afraid.

PADME: Now, Viceroy, we will discuss a new treaty.

INT THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

The pulsing electron gate opens, and OBI-WAN attacks the SITH LORD. The JEDI is relentless in his assault on the SITH LORD.

OBI-WAN slices through the center of THE DARK LORD's laser sword and he looses half.

The JEDI flips as DARTH MAUL gets up to continue the fight.

As OBI-WAN grows weary, he is kicked in the chin by the DARK LORD.

The TWO continue to fight DARTH MAUL FORCE THROWS OBI-WAN into a melting pit. He is barely able to hold onto a nozzle on the side of the pit. DARTH MAUL grins evilly at OBI-WAN as he kicks OBI-WAN's lightsaber down the endless shaft.

INT NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ARTOO whistles.

ANAKIN sees the dashboard lights go from red to green.

ANAKIN: Yes! We have power. Shields up.

ANAKIN flips a switch and the ship levitates, knocking over the BATTLE DROID CAPTAIN. The OTHER DROIDS shoot, but the lasers are deflected by ANAKIN's shields. ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN: Take this!...

ANAKIN fires lasers as the ship begins to rotate.

ANAKIN: (cont'd)... and this!

He presses a button and launches two torpedoes which miss the DROIDS.

ANAKIN: Woa!

The two torpedoes fly down a hallway and explode inside the reactor room.

ANAKIN: Oops.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

TEY HOW turns to CAPTAIN DOFINE.

TEY HOW: Sir, we're losing power... There seems to be a problem with the main reactor...

DOFINE: Impossible!! Nothing can get through our shield.

INT NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ANAKIN continues to fire, maneuvering the ship towards the exit.

ANAKIN: Let's get out of here.

ARTOO beeps in agreement.

INT NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

RIC OLIE watches in amazement as the Federation battleship starts to explode from the inside out.

BRAVO TWO: What's that?? It's blowing up from the inside.

RIC OLIE: We didn't hit it.

INT NABOO STARFIGHTER - COCKPIT - FEDERATION HANGER

ANAKIN's ship roars through the hanger deck, bouncing over the DROIDS.

ANAKIN: (Cont'd) Now, this is Podracing!

INT NABOO FIGHTER - COCKPIT - SPACE

A lone NABOO FIGHTER comes into view.

BRAVO THREE: Look! One of ours! Outta the main hold!!

ANAKIN: Whoo, hoo!

All the pilots start to cheer and laugh in ANAKIN's excitement.

INT FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE

The bridge explodes as DOFINE and TEY HOW look for a way to escape.

EXT NABOO GRASS PLAINS - DAY

Suddenly, all of the DROIDS begin to shake upside down, run around in circles, then stop. The GUNGANS carefully move out to inspect the FROZEN DROIDS. JAR JAR pushes one of the BATTLE DROIDS, and it falls over.

JAR JAR: Whatsen dey doin?

CAPT. TARPALS: The control ship has been destroyed. Look!

He pushes one over to show what he means.

JAR JAR: Dey all broken.

The GUNGANS cheer.

INT THEED - POWER GENERATOR - MELTING PIT

The SITH LORD smiles as he goes in for the kill. At the last moment, OBI-WAN jumps up out of the pit, calls QUI-GON's lightsaber to him, throwing DARTH MAUL off. The young JEDI swings with a vengeance, cutting the SITH down. DARTH MAUL falls into the melting pit to his death.

OBI-WAN rushes over to QUI-GON, who is dying.

QUI-GON: It is too late... It's...

OBI-WAN: No!

QUI-GON: Obi-Wan promise ... promise me you'll train the boy...

OBI-WAN: Yes, Master...

QUI-GON: He is the chosen one... he will... bring balance... train him!

QUI-GON dies. OBI-WAN cradles his Master, quietly weeping.

INT MAIN HANGER - COURTYARD - DAY

The large, grand cruiser of the Supreme Chancellor lands in the courtyard of the main hanger. CAPTAIN PANAKA and TWENTY TROOPS guard NUTE GUNRAY and RUNE HAAKO. OBI-WAN, the QUEEN, and her HANDMAIDENS stand before the NEIMOIDIANS.

PADME: Now, Viceroy, you are going to have to go back to the Senate and explain all this.

CAPT. PANAKA: I think you can kiss your Trade franchise goodbye.

The main ramp of the cruiser is lowered as OBI-WAN and CAPTAIN PANAKA lead the VICEROY and HIS ASSISTANT toward the ship. The GRAND CHANCELLOR PALPATINE and SEVERAL REPUBLIC GUARDS descend the walkway, followed by YODA and SEVERAL OTHER JEDI MASTERS.

The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE walks up to OBI-WAN and ANAKIN. The JEDI bow before him.

PALPATINE: (to Obi-Wan) We are indebted to you for your bravery, Obi-Wan Kenobi. (to Anakin) And you, young Skywalker, we will watch your career with great interest.

The CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is greeted by the QUEEN.

AMIDALA: Congratulations on your election, Chancellor.

PALPATINE: Your boldness has saved our people, Your Majesty. It is you who should be congratulated. Together we shall bring peace and prosperity to the Republic.

INT. TURRET ROOM - NABOO PALACE - LATE DAY

The sun streams into the multi-windowed room at a low angle. It is not quite sunset. YODA paces before OBI-WAN, who is kneeling in the center of the room.

YODA: Confer on you, the level of Jedi Knight the Council does. But agree on you taking this boy as your Padawan learner, I do not.

OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon believed in him.

YODA: The Chosen One the boy may be; nevertheless, grave danger I fear in his training.

OBI-WAN: Master Yoda, I gave Qui-Gon my word. I will train Anakin. Without the approval of the Council if I must.

YODA: Qui-Gon's defiance I sense in you. Need that, you do not. Agree with you, the council does. Your apprentice, Skywalker will be.

EXT THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - FUNERAL TEMPLE STEPS - SUNSET

QUI-GON's body goes up in flames as the JEDI COUNCIL, the QUEEN, SIO BIBBLE, CAPTAIN PANAKA, the HANDMAIDENS, and ABOUT ONE HUNDRED NABOO TROOPES, TWENTY OTHER JEDI, PALPATINE, OBI-WAN (standing with ANAKIN), JAR JAR, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum roll that stops. Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to OBI-WAN.

ANAKIN: What will happen to me now?

OBI-WAN: The Council has granted me permission to train you. You will be a Jedi, I promise.

To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.

MACE WINDU: There's no doubt. The mysterious warrior was a Sith.

YODA: Always two there are.... no more... no less. A master and an apprentice.

MACE WINDU: But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?

They give each other a concerned look as the camera pans over to PALPATINE.

EXT THEED - CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY

CHILDEREN SING and throw flowers on the passing GUNGAN SOLDIERS. The CROWDS CHEER. It is a grand parade.

QUEEN AMIDALA stands next to the SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE, ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, SIO BIBBLE, and the JEDI COUNCIL. ARTOO stands in front of the QUEEN'S HANDMAIDENS and whistles at the parade. QUEEN AMIDALA and PALPATINE smile at one another.

In the parade are BOSS NASS and his GUARDS, JAR JAR and GENERAL CEEL. The GUNGANS ride KAADU. They stop before the QUEEN and walk up the steps to stand by her side. BOSS NASS holds up the Globe of Peace.

BOSS NASS: Peace!

EVERYONE CHEERS. The parade marches on. AMIDALA looks over at ANAKIN and smiles.

EXT. SPACE
A vast sea of stars severas as a backdrop for the Main Title, following by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.

There is unrest in the Galactic
Senate. Several thousand solar
systems have declared their
intentions to leave the Republic.

This separatist movement,
under the leadership of the
mysterious Count Dooku, has
made it difficult for the limited
number of Jedi Knights to maintain
peace and order in the galaxy.

Senator Amidala, the former
Queen of Naboo, is returning
to the Galactic Senate to vote
on the critical issue of creating
an ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC
to assist the overwhelmed
Jedi....				

PAN UP to reveal the amber city planet of Coruscant. A yellow Naboo Fighter flies OVER CAMERA toward the planet, followed by a large Royal Cruiser and two more Fighters.

EXT. CITYSCAPE, CORUSCANT - DAWN
The ships skim across the surface of the city landscape. The sun glints off the chrome hulls of the sleek Naboo spacecraft as they navigate between the buildings of the capital planet.

1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Attack of the clones

2
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,719
Senator, we're making
our final approach into Coruscant.

3
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,876
Very good, Lieutenant.

4
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,232
We made it.

5
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,192
I guess I was wrong.

6
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,436
There was no danger at all.

7
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,078
Cordé.

8
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,193
Milady, I'm so sorry.

9
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,071
I've failed you, Senator.

10
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,269
No.

11
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,709
Milady, you're still in danger here.

12
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,037
- I shouldn't have come back.
- This vote is very important.

13
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,830
You did your duty.
Cordé did hers. Now, come.

14
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,631
Senator Amidala, please.

15
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,718
I don't know how much longer
I can hold off the vote, my friends.

16
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,199
More and more star systems
are joining the separatists.

17
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,038
If they do break away--

18
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,277
I will not let this Republic
that has stood for a thousand years...

19
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,356
be split in two.

20
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,313
My negotiations will not fail.

21
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,870
If they do, you must realize...

22
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,991
there aren't enough Jedi
to protect the Republic.

23
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:39,474
We're keepers of the peace,
not soldiers.

24
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,518
Master Yoda...

25
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,000
do you think it will
really come to war?

26
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,558
The dark side clouds everything.

27
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,435
Impossible to see the future is.

28
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,272
The Loyalist Committee
has arrived, Your Honour.

29
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,355
Good.

30
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,836
Send them in.

31
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,679
We will discuss this matter later.

32
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:17,429
Senator Amidala, your tragedy
on the landing platform--

33
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,357
terrible.

34
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,070
Seeing you alive brings
warm feelings to my heart.

35
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,794
Do you have any idea
who was behind this attack?

36
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:30,311
Our intelligence points to disgruntled
spice miners on the moons of Naboo.

37
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,156
I think that Count Dooku
was behind it.

38
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,989
He is a political idealist,
not a murderer.

39
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,953
You know, milady,
Count Dooku was once a Jedi.

40
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,390
He couldn't assassinate anyone.
It's not in his character.

41
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,954
But for certain, Senator...

42
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,755
in grave danger you are.

43
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,633
Master Jedi, may I suggest...

44
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,673
the senator be placed under
the protection of your graces?

45
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,712
Do you really think that's a wise
decision under these stressful times?

46
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,831
Chancellor, if I may comment,
I do not believe--

47
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,190
The situation is that serious?

48
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,637
No, but I do, Senator.

49
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,957
I realize all too well
that additional security...

50
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,390
might be disruptive for you...

51
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,080
but perhaps someone
you're familiar with.

52
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,029
An old friend, like Master Kenobi.

53
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,313
That's possible.

54
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,079
He's just returned
from a border dispute on Ansion.

55
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,236
Do it for me, milady. Please?

56
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,635
The thought of losing you...

57
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,276
is unbearable.

58
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,157
I will have Obi-Wan
report to you immediately, milady.

59
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,430
Thank you, Master Windu.

60
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,795
- You seem a little on edge.
- Not at all.

61
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,390
I haven't felt you this tense since
we fell into that nest of gundarks.

62
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,997
You fell into that nightmare, Master...

63
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,429
and I rescued you, remember?

64
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,831
Oh... yes.

65
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,959
You're sweating. Relax.
Take a deep breath.

66
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,030
I haven't seen her
in ten years, Master.

67
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,714
Obi? Obi!

68
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,355
- Mesa so smilen to seein yousa!
- Good to see you again,Jar Jar.

69
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,357
Senator Padmé.

00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,916
Mesa palos here!
Lookie, lookie, Senator.

71
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,634
Desa Jedi arriven.

72
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,954
It's a great pleasure
to see you again, milady.

73
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,435
It has been far too long,
Master Kenobi.

74
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,113
Ani?

75
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,391
- My goodness, you've grown.
- So have you.

76
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,795
Grown more beautiful, I mean.

77
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,480
Well, for a senator, I mean.

78
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,752
Ani, you'll always be that little boy
I knew on Tatooine.

79
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,590
Our presence here will be invisible,
milady, I can assure you.

80
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,029
I'm Captain Typho
of Her Majesty's security service.

81
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,116
Queen Jamillia has been informed
of your assignment.

82
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,276
I am grateful you are here,
Master Kenobi.

83
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,039
The situation is more dangerous
than the senator will admit.

84
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,720
I don't need more security.
I need answers.

85
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,956
I want to know
who's trying to kill me.

86
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,709
We are here to protect you,
Senator, not to start an investigation.

87
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,115
We will find out
who's trying to kill you, Padmé.

88
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,992
I promise you.

89
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,714
We will not exceed our mandate,
my young Padawan learner.

90
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:43,638
I meant that in the interest
of protecting her, Master, of course.

91
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,149
We will not go through
this exercise again, Anakin...

92
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,111
and you will pay attention
to my lead.

93
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,231
- Why?
- What?

94
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:55,589
Why else do you think we were assigned
to her if not to find the killer?

95
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,837
Protection is a job
for local security, not Jedi.

96
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,679
It's overkill, Master.
Investigation is implied in our mandate.

97
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,917
We will do exactly
as the council has instructed.

98
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,198
And you will learn
your place, young one.

99
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,471
Perhaps with merely your presence...

100
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,398
the mystery surrounding
this threat will be revealed.

101
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,988
Now, if you'll excuse me...

102
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,878
I will retire.

103
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,156
I know I'll feel better
having you here.

104
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,316
I'll have an officer stationed
on every floor...

105
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,510
and I'll be in the control centre
downstairs.

106
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,958
Mesa busten wit happiness
seein yousa again, Ani.

107
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,072
She hardly even
recognized me,Jar Jar.

108
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,438
I've thought about her
every day since we parted and...

109
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,637
she's forgotten me completely.

110
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,318
Shesa happy.

111
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,715
Happier den mesa seein her
in a longo time.

112
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:53,469
You're focusing on the negative, Anakin.
Be mindful of your thoughts.

113
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:56,109
She was pleased to see us.

114
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,117
Now, let's check the security.

115
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,756
I hit the ship,
but they used a decoy.

116
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,030
We'll have to try something
more subtle this time, Zam.

117
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,071
My client is getting impatient.

118
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,919
Take these. Be careful.
They're very poisonous.

119
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:19,316
And, Zam, there can be
no mistakes this time.

120
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,830
Captain Typho has
more than enough men downstairs.

121
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,791
No assassin would try that way.

122
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,794
- Any activity up here?
- Quiet as a tomb.

123
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,999
I don't like just waiting here
for something to happen to her.

124
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,477
- What's going on?
- She covered the cameras.

125
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,111
I don't think she liked me
watching her.

126
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,037
What is she thinking?

127
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,038
She programmed R2 to warn us
if there is an intruder.

128
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:47,628
There are many other ways
to kill a senator.

129
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,912
I know, but we also want to catch
this assassin, don't we, Master?

130
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,951
You're using her as bait.

131
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,036
It was her idea.

132
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,594
Don't worry.
No harm will come to her.

133
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:03,553
I can sense everything
going on in that room.

134
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,830
Trust me.

135
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,757
It's too risky.

136
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,312
Besides, your senses aren't
that attuned, my young apprentice.

137
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,631
And yours are?

138
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,557
Possibly.

139
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,197
You look tired.

140
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,797
I don't sleep well any more.

141
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,309
Because of your mother?

142
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,953
I don't know
why I keep dreaming about her.

143
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,431
Dreams pass in time.

144
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,394
I'd much rather dream about Padmé.

145
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,513
Just being around her again is...
intoxicating.

146
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,995
Be mindful of your thoughts, Anakin.
They betray you.

147
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,315
You've made a commitment
to the Jedi order...

148
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,396
a commitment not easily broken.

149
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:08,159
And don't forget, she's a politician.
They're not to be trusted.

150
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,748
She's not like the others
in the senate, Master.

151
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,916
It is my experience
that senators focus...

152
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,793
only on pleasing those
who fund their campaigns...

153
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,910
and they're in no means scared of
forgetting the niceties of democracy...

154
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,110
- in order to get those funds.
- Not another lecture.

155
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,913
At least not
on the economics of politics.

156
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,874
And besides, you're generalizing.

157
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,956
The chancellor doesn't appear
to be corrupt.

158
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,638
Palpatine is a politician.

159
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:27,274
I have observed
that he is very clever...

160
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,188
in following the passions
and the prejudices of the senators.

161
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,117
I think he's a good man--

162
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,037
I sense it too.

163
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,440
Stay here!

164
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,591
Are you all right, milady?

165
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,789
What the--

166
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,672
Jedi poo doo!

167
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,150
- What took you so long?
- Oh, you know, Master.

168
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,033
- I couldn't find a speeder I liked...
- There he is.

169
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,391
with the open cockpit
and the right speed capabilities.

170
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:52,193
If you spent as long practising your
sabre techniques as you do your wit...

171
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,958
you would rival Master Yoda
as a swordsman.

172
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,672
I thought I already did.

173
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,394
Only in your mind,
my very young apprentice.

174
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,029
Pull up, Anakin. Pull up!

175
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,916
You know I don't like it
when you do that.

176
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,112
Sorry, Master.
I forgot you don't like flying.

177
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,913
I don't mind flying,
but what you're doing is suicide!

178
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:12,913
Anakin! How many times
have I told you...

179
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,116
stay away from power couplings!

180
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,994
That was good!

181
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:36,309
Where are you going?
He went that way.

182
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,351
Master, if we keep this chase
going any longer...

183
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,391
that creep is gonna end up deep-fried...

184
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:44,593
and, personally, I'd like to find out
who he is and who he's working for.

185
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,280
This is a short cut... I think.

186
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,712
Well, you've lost him.

187
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,196
I'm deeply sorry, Master.

188
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,117
That was some short cut, Anakin.

189
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,549
He went completely the other way.

190
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,636
- Once again you've proved--
- If you'll excuse me.

191
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,548
I hate it when he does that.

192
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,152
Anakin!

193
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,953
- She went into the club, Master.
- Patience.

194
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,436
- Use the Force. Think.
- Sorry, Master.

195
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,199
- He went in there to hide, not to run.
- Yes, Master.

196
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,993
- Next time, try not to lose it.
- Yes, Master.

197
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,874
- This weapon is your life.
- I try, Master.

198
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,560
Why do I get the feeling
you're going to be the death of me?

199
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,272
Don't say that, Master.

200
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,356
You're the closest thing
I have to a father.

201
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,232
Then why don't you listen to me?

202
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,873
I am trying.

203
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,351
Can you see him?

204
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,311
I think he is a she...

205
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,000
and I think she is a changeling.

206
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,114
In that case, be extra careful.

207
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,389
- Go and find her.
- Where are you going, Master?

208
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,919
For a drink.

209
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,832
Thank you.

210
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,836
-You wanna buy some death sticks?
-You don't want to sell me death sticks.

211
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,791
I don't want to
sell you death sticks.

212
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,911
You want to go home
and rethink your life.

213
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,270
I want to go home
and rethink my life.

214
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,708
Easy.

215
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,876
Jedi business.
Go back to your drinks.

216
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:07,754
Do you know who it was
you were trying to kill?

217
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,118
It was a senator from Naboo.

218
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,754
- And who hired you?
- It was just a job.

219
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,990
Who hired you? Tell us.

220
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,351
Tell us now!

221
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,032
It was a bounty hunter called--

222
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,398
Wee shahnit... sleemo.

223
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,352
Toxic dart.

224
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:56,239
Track down this bounty hunter
you must, Obi-Wan.

225
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:59,636
Most importantly,
find out who he's working for.

226
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,469
What about Senator Amidala?
She will still need protecting.

227
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,398
Handle that your Padawan will.

228
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,550
Anakin, escort the senator
back to her home planet of Naboo.

229
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,229
She'll be safer there.
And don't use registered transport.

230
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,237
Travel as refugees.

231
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,113
As the leader of the opposition,
it will be very difficult...

232
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,515
to get Senator Amidala
to leave the capital.

233
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,159
Until caught this killer is...

234
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,192
our judgement she must respect.

235
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,631
Anakin, go to the senate...

236
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,797
and ask Chancellor Palpatine
to speak with her about this matter.

237
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,191
I will talk with her.

238
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,278
Senator Amidala will not refuse
an executive order.

239
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,470
I know her well enough
to assure you of that.

240
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,556
Thank you, Your Excellency.

241
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,877
And so, they've finally
given you an assignment.

242
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,877
Your patience has paid off.

243
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,195
Your guidance
more than my patience.

244
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,550
You don't need guidance, Anakin.

245
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,718
In time, you will learn
to trust your feelings.

246
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:12,591
Then you will be invincible.

247
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,397
I have said it many times:

248
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,159
You are the most gifted Jedi
I have ever met.

249
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,077
Thank you, Your Excellency.

250
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:25,715
I see you becoming the greatest
of all the Jedi, Anakin...

251
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,274
even more powerful
than Master Yoda.

252
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,151
I am concerned for my Padawan.

253
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:37,874
He is not ready to be given
this assignment on his own yet.

254
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,072
The council is confident
in its decision, Obi-Wan.

255
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,077
The boy has exceptional skills.

256
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,509
But he still has much to learn, Master.

257
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,916
His abilities have made him,
well, arrogant.

258
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,917
Yes.

259
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:53,838
A flaw more and more common
among Jedi.

260
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,155
Too sure of themselves they are.

261
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,556
Even the older,
more experienced ones.

262
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:05,070
Remember, Obi-Wan,
if the prophecy is true...

263
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,670
your apprentice is the only one who can
bring the Force back into balance.

264
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,313
I'm taking
an extended leave of absence.

265
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:18,432
It will be your responsibility
to take my place in the senate.

266
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:21,313
Representative Binks,
I know I can count on you.

267
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:25,752
Mesa honoured to be taking on
dissa heavy burden.

268
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,193
Mesa accept this
with muy, muy humility and--

269
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,754
Jar Jar, I don't wish to hold you up.

270
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,757
I'm sure you have
a great deal to do.

271
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,598
Of course.

272
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,393
Milady.

273
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,597
I do not like this idea of hiding.

274
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,669
Don't worry.

275
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,916
Now that the council
has ordered an investigation...

276
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,600
it won't take Master Obi-Wan long
to find this bounty hunter.

277
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,473
I haven't worked for a year
to defeat the Military Creation Act...

278
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,556
to not be here
when its fate is decided.

279
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,636
Sometimes we must
let go of our pride...

280
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,194
and do what is requested of us.

281
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,629
Anakin, you've grown up.

282
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,749
Master Obi-Wan manages
not to see it.

283
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,873
Don't get me wrong.

284
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,719
Obi-Wan is a great mentor.

285
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,229
As wise as Master Yoda and...

286
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,396
as powerful as Master Windu.

287
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,989
I am truly thankful
to be his apprentice.

288
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,992
In some ways--
a lot of ways--

289
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,837
I'm really ahead of him.

290
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:39,312
I'm ready for the trials...

291
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,671
but he feels that
I'm too unpredictable.

292
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,631
He won't let me move on.

293
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,630
- That must be frustrating.
- It's worse.

294
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,433
He's overly critical.
He never listens.

295
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,790
He doesn't understand.

296
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,911
It's not fair!

297
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:59,636
All mentors have a way of seeing
more of our faults than we would like.

298
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,671
It's the only way we grow.

299
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,073
I know.

300
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,911
Anakin...

301
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,589
don't try to grow up too fast.

302
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,551
But I am grown up.

303
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,557
You said it yourself.

304
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,631
Please don't look at me like that.

305
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,999
Why not?

306
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,156
It makes me feel uncomfortable.

307
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,957
Sorry, milady.

308
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,279
- Be safe, milady.
- Thank you, Captain.

309
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,312
Take good care of Dormé.
The threat's on you two now.

310
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:52,317
He'll be safe with me.

311
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,118
You'll be fine.

312
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,277
It's not me, milady.
I worry about you.

313
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,630
What if they realize
you've left the capital?

314
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:07,911
Well, then my Jedi protector
will have to prove how good he is.

315
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,837
Anakin...

316
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,918
don't do anything without first
consulting either myself or the council.

317
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,871
Yes, Master.

318
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,389
I'll get to the bottom
of this plot quickly, milady.

319
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,351
You'll be back here in no time.

320
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,552
I'll be most grateful
for your speed, Master Jedi.

321
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,477
- It's time to go.
- I know.

322
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,989
Anakin, may the Force be with you.

323
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,076
May the Force be with you, Master.

324
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,877
Suddenly I'm afraid.

325
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:46,436
This is my first assignment on my own.
I am too.

326
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,796
Don't worry.
We have R2 with us.

327
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,394
I do hope he doesn't try
anything foolish.

328
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,430
I'd be more concerned about her
doing something than him.

329
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,991
Someone to see ya, honey!

330
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:27,237
Jedi, by the looks of him.

331
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,793
Obi-Wan!

332
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,068
Hello, Dex.

333
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:34,668
Take a seat.
I'll be right with ya.

334
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,833
- You wanna cup o' jawa juice?
- Oh, yes. Thank you.

335
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,390
Old buddy!

336
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,198
So, my friend, what can I do for ya?

337
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:00,072
You can tell me what this is.

338
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,592
Well, whattaya know!

339
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,995
I ain't seen one of these
since I was prospectin'...

340
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,192
on Subterrel, beyond the outer rim.

341
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,629
Can you tell me
where it came from?

342
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,593
This baby belongs to them cloners.

343
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:19,838
What you got here
is a Kamino sabredart.

344
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,793
I wonder why it didn't show up
in the analysis archives.

345
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,037
It's these funny little cuts on the side
that give it away.

346
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,914
Those analysis droids
only focus on symbols.

347
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,190
I should think that you Jedi
would have more respect...

348
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,550
for the difference
between knowledge and...

349
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,238
wisdom.

350
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,271
Well, if droids could think...

351
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,356
there'd be none of us here,
would there?

352
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,150
Kamino. I'm not familiar with it.
Is it in the Republic?

353
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:46,157
No, no. It's beyond the outer rim.

354
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:51,638
I'd say about 1 2 parsecs
outside the Rishi Maze.

355
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,117
Should be easy to find,
even for those droids in your archives.

356
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,556
These Kaminoans
keep to themselves.

357
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:04,433
They're cloners.
Damn good ones too.

358
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,518
- Cloners. Are they friendly?
- Depends.

359
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,751
Depends on what, Dex?

360
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,599
On how good your manners are...

361
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:17,838
and how big your... pocketbook is.

362
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,708
- Did you call for assistance?
- Yes, I did.

363
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,876
Are you having a problem,
Master Kenobi?

364
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,117
Yes, I'm looking for a planetary system
called Kamino.

365
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,390
It doesn't show up
on the archive charts.

366
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,638
Kamino. It's not a system
I'm familiar with.

367
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,990
Are you sure you have
the right coordinates?

368
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,953
According to my information, it should
appear in this quadrant here...

369
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,071
just south of the Rishi Maze.

370
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,917
I hate to say it, but it looks like
the system you're searching for...

371
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,837
doesn't exist.

372
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:05,077
Impossible.
Perhaps the archives are incomplete.

373
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,112
If an item does not appear
in our records...

374
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,231
it does not exist.

375
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,270
Hey, you! No droids!

376
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,437
Get outta here!

377
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,797
Thank you, R2.

378
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,313
Must be difficult,
having sworn your life to the Jedi...

379
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:51,149
not being able to visit the places
you like or do the things you like.

380
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,316
Or be with the people that I love.

381
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,151
Are you allowed to love?

382
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,032
I thought that was forbidden
for a Jedi.

383
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,635
Attachment is forbidden.

384
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,157
Possession is forbidden.

385
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,716
Compassion, which I would define
as unconditional love...

386
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,149
is central to a Jedi's life.

387
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:19,712
So you might say that
we are encouraged to love.

388
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,671
You've changed so much.

389
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,234
You haven't changed a bit.

390
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,079
You're exactly the way
I remember you in my dreams.

391
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,789
Reach out.
Sense the Force around you.

392
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,480
Use your feelings you must.

393
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:52,598
Younglings. Younglings!

394
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:55,029
A visitor we have.

395
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,913
Hello, Master Obi-Wan.

396
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,393
Hello.

397
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,953
I'm sorry to disturb you, Master.

398
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,310
What help can I be, Obi-Wan?

399
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,473
I'm looking for a planet
described to me by an old friend.

400
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,592
I trust him, but the systems don't show
on the archive maps.

401
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:14,839
Lost a planet Master Obi-Wan has.

402
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,837
How embarrassing!

403
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,071
Liam, the shades.

404
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,709
Gather round the map reader.

405
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,910
Clear your minds...

406
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:31,350
and find Obi-Wan's
wayward planet we will.

407
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,512
It ought to be here...

408
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,437
but it isn't.

409
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,836
Gravity is pulling all the stars
in the area towards this spot.

410
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,391
Gravity's silhouette remains...

411
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,318
but the star and all the planets...

412
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,351
disappeared they have.

413
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,516
How can this be?

414
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,238
A thought?

415
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,917
Anyone.

416
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,713
Master?

417
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,593
Because someone erased it
from the archive memory.

418
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:08,509
Truly wonderful the mind of a child is.

419
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,436
The Padawan is right.

420
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:16,472
Go to the centre of gravity's pull...

421
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,910
and find your planet you will.

422
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,998
The data must have been erased.

423
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,951
But who could empty information from
the archives? Isn't that impossible?

424
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,311
Dangerous and disturbing
this puzzle is.

425
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:40,592
Only a Jedi
could have erased those files.

426
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,996
But who and why, harder to answer.

427
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,759
Meditate on this I will.

428
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,795
I wasn't the youngest queen
ever elected...

429
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,356
but now that I think back on it,
I'm not sure I was old enough.

430
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,311
I'm not sure I was ready.

431
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,874
The people you served
thought you did a good job.

432
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,236
I heard they even tried
to amend the constitution...

433
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,316
so you could stay in office.

434
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,795
I was relieved
when my two terms were up.

435
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:32,435
But when the queen asked me
to serve as senator...

436
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,471
I couldn't refuse her.

437
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,957
I agree with her.
I think the Republic needs you.

438
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,036
I'm glad that you chose to serve.

439
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:52,150
If the senate votes to create an army,
it's sure to push us into a civil war.

440
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,032
It's unthinkable!

441
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,391
There hasn't been a full-scale war
since the formation of the Republic.

442
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,875
Do you see any way
through negotiations...

443
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,991
to bring the separatists
back into the Republic?

444
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,190
Not if they feel threatened.

445
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,517
They'll turn to the Trade Federations
or the Commerce Guilds for help.

446
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,517
It's outrageous...

447
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,790
but after four trials
in the Supreme Court...

448
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,549
Nute Gunray is still the viceroy
of the Trade Federation.

449
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,514
I fear the senate is powerless
to resolve this crisis.

450
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:23,630
We must keep our faith
in the Republic.

451
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,119
The day we stop believing democracy
can work is the day we lose it.

452
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,800
Let's pray that day never comes.

453
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:39,480
In the meantime,
we must consider your own safety.

454
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,430
What is your suggestion, Master Jedi?

455
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,757
Anakin's not a Jedi yet.
He's still a Padawan learner.

456
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,632
- But I was thinking--
- Hold on a minute.

457
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,954
Excuse me.

458
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,389
I was thinking I would stay
in the lake country.

459
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,636
There are some places up there
that are very isolated.

460
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,672
Excuse me. I'm in charge
of security here, milady.

461
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,273
And this is my home. I know it
very well. That is why we're here.

462
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,277
I think it would be wise...

463
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,675
if you took advantage
of my knowledge in this instance.

464
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,831
Sorry, milady.

465
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,956
Perfect. It's settled, then.

466
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,954
There it is, R4,
right where it should be.

467
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,832
Our missing planet Kamino.

468
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,237
Master Jedi.

469
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,550
The prime minister is expecting you.

470
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,035
- I'm expected?
- Of course.

471
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:19,070
He is anxious to meet you.

472
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,270
After all these years...

473
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,836
we were beginning to think
you weren't coming.

474
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,076
Now, please, this way.

475
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,715
May I present Lama Su...

476
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,796
prime minister of Kamino.

477
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,436
And this is Master Jedi--

478
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,477
Obi-Wan Kenobi.

479
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,751
I trust you're going
to enjoy your stay.

480
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,037
Please.

481
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,710
And now to business.

482
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:03,594
You will be delighted to hear
that we are on schedule.

483
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:06,477
200,000 units are ready...

484
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,830
with a million more
well on the way.

485
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,791
That's good news.

486
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,912
Please tell your Master Sifo-Dyas...

487
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:18,237
that his order will be met on time.

488
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:20,237
I'm sorry. Master--

489
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,794
Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas is still...

490
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,912
a leading member of the Jedi Council,
is he not?

491
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,669
Master Sifo-Dyas was killed
almost ten years ago.

492
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,470
I'm so sorry to hear that.

493
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:38,673
But I'm sure he would have been proud
of the army we've built for him.

494
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,030
The army?

495
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,630
Yes, a clone army, and I must say...

496
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:46,876
one of the finest we've ever created.

497
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,877
Tell me, Prime Minister...

498
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,355
when my master first contacted you
about the army...

499
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,516
did he say who it was for?

500
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,551
Of course he did.

501
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,240
This army is for the Republic.

502
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:02,516
But you must be anxious
to inspect the units for yourself.

503
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,996
That's why I'm here.

504
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,036
We used to come here
for school retreat.

505
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,711
We would swim
to that island every day.

506
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:34,877
I love the water.

507
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:42,910
We used to lie out on the sand
and let the sun dry us...

508
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,233
and try to guess the names
of the birds singing.

509
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,911
I don't like sand.

510
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:55,195
It's coarse and rough and irritating...

511
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,477
and it gets everywhere.

512
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,556
Not like here.

513
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,037
Here, everything is soft...

514
00:43:06,120 --> 00:43:08,190
and smooth.

515
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:44,872
No.

516
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,476
I shouldn't have done that.

517
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,037
I'm sorry.

518
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,638
Very impressive.

519
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:07,796
I'd hoped you would be pleased.

520
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,189
Clones can think creatively.

521
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,029
You will find that they are
immensely superior to droids.

522
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,829
We take great pride in our combat
education and training programmes.

523
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:29,157
This group was created
about five years ago.

524
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,236
You mentioned growth acceleration.

525
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:33,191
Oh, yes, it's essential.

526
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,198
Otherwise, a mature clone
would take a lifetime to grow.

527
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,788
Now we can do it in half the time.

528
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:41,434
I see.

529
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,357
They are totally obedient...

530
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:46,040
taking any order without question.

531
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,116
We modified their genetic structure...

532
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,312
to make them less independent
than the original host.

533
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,874
And who was the original host?

534
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,991
A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.

535
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:59,511
And where is this bounty hunter now?

536
00:44:59,640 --> 00:45:01,676
Oh, we keep him here.

537
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,959
Apart from his pay,
which is considerable...

538
00:45:07,080 --> 00:45:09,435
Fett demanded only one thing:

539
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,028
an unaltered clone for himself.

540
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,469
- Curious, isn't it?
-"Unaltered''?

541
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:16,989
Pure genetic replication.

542
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:20,112
No tampering with the structure
to make it more docile...

543
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,674
and no growth acceleration.

544
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,917
I should very much like
to meet this Jango Fett.

545
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,157
I would be very happy
to arrange it for you.

546
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,713
Magnificent, aren't they?

547
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,352
I don't know.

548
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,590
Sure you do.
You just don't want to tell me.

549
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:01,950
You gonna use one of your
Jedi mind tricks on me?

550
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:04,071
They only work on the weak-minded.

551
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,998
All right.

552
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:09,190
I was 1 2.
His name was Palo.

553
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:11,675
We were both
in the Legislative Youth Programme.

554
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:14,712
He was a few years older than I.
Very cute.

555
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,070
Dark, curly hair.
Dreamy eyes.

556
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,111
All right, I get the picture.

557
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,277
Whatever happened to him?

558
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,994
I went into public service.
He went on to become an artist.

559
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,076
Maybe he was the smart one.

560
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,350
You really don't like
politicians, do you?

561
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,516
I like two or three...

562
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:32,631
but I'm not really sure
about one of them.

563
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,471
I don't think the system works.

564
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,155
How would you have it work?

565
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:45,309
We need a system where the politicians
sit down and discuss the problem...

566
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,149
agree what's in the best interest
of all the people...

567
00:46:48,280 --> 00:46:50,032
and then do it.

568
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,832
That's exactly what we do.

569
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,871
The trouble is that people
don't always agree.

570
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:55,797
Well, then they should be made to.

571
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,832
- By whom? Who's gonna make them?
- I don't know. Someone.

572
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:00,916
- You?
- Of course not me.

573
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,873
- But someone.
- Someone wise.

574
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,629
Sounds an awful lot
like a dictatorship to me.

575
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,230
Well, if it works.

576
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,758
- You're making fun of me.
- No.

577
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,314
I'd be much too frightened
to tease a senator.

578
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:02,189
Ani, are you all right?

579
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,952
Boba, is your father here?

580
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,915
Yep.

581
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:43,996
May we see him?

582
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,791
Sure.

583
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,396
Dad, Taun We's here.

584
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,395
Jango, welcome back.

585
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,551
Was your trip productive?

586
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:09,511
Fairly.

587
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,269
This is Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.

588
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:16,073
He's come to check on our progress.

589
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,153
Your clones are very impressive.
You must be very proud.

590
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:22,158
I'm just a simple man trying
to make my way in the universe.

591
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:25,795
Ever made your way as far
into the interior as Coruscant?

592
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,676
- Once or twice.
- Recently?

593
00:49:30,760 --> 00:49:32,352
Possibly.

594
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:34,471
Then you must know
Master Sifo-Dyas.

595
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,831
Boba, rood eht so-heeck.

596
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,353
Master who?

597
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,233
Sifo-Dyas.

598
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,874
Is he not the Jedi
who hired you for this job?

599
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:54,517
Never heard of him.

600
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:59,069
Really?

601
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,433
I was recruited by a man called Tyranus
on one of the moons of Bogden.

602
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:04,913
Curious.

603
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,916
Do you like your army?

604
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,597
I look forward
to seeing them in action.

605
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,032
They'll do their job well.
I'll guarantee that.

606
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:20,196
Thank you for your time,Jango.

607
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,911
Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.

608
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,670
What is it, Dad?

609
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,911
Pack your things.
We're leaving.

610
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,758
And when I got to them,
we went into aggressive negotiations.

611
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:58,836
" Aggressive negotiations''?
What's that?

612
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:02,277
Well, negotiations with a lightsabre.

613
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,752
If Master Obi-Wan caught me
doing this, he'd be very grumpy.

614
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,036
From the moment I met you...

615
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,190
all those years ago...

616
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:54,478
not a day has gone by
when I haven't thought of you.

617
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,395
And now that I'm with you again...

618
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:02,031
I'm in agony.

619
00:52:05,320 --> 00:52:08,995
The closer I get to you,
the worse it gets.

620
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,429
The thought of not being with you--

621
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,111
I can't breathe.

622
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,671
I'm haunted by the kiss...

623
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,633
that you should never have given me.

624
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,275
My heart is beating...

625
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,198
hoping that that kiss
will not become a scar.

626
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,073
You are in my very soul...

627
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,156
tormenting me.

628
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,876
What can I do?
I will do anything that you ask.

629
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:54,836
If you are suffering
as much as I am, please, tell me.

630
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,437
I can't.

631
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:02,432
We can't.
It's... just not possible.

632
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,393
Anything is possible, Padmé.
Listen to me.

633
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,476
No, you listen.

634
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:11,516
We live in a real world.
Come back to it.

635
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:15,155
You're studying to become a Jedi.
I'm a senator.

636
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:19,355
If you follow your thoughts
through to conclusion...

637
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:21,835
it'll take us to a place
we cannot go...

638
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,196
regardless of the way
we feel about each other.

639
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:27,231
Then you do feel something.

640
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:30,238
I will not let you give up
your future for me.

641
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,430
You are asking me to be rational.

642
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,670
That is something
I know I cannot do.

643
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,237
Believe me, I wish that
I could just wish away my feelings...

644
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,271
but I can't.

645
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,794
I will not give in to this.

646
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,756
Well, you know...

647
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,553
it wouldn't have to be that way.

648
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:00,399
We could keep it a secret.

649
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,677
We'd be living a lie...

650
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:05,995
one we couldn't keep
even if we wanted to.

651
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,230
I couldn't do that.

652
00:54:09,360 --> 00:54:12,113
Could you, Anakin?
Could you live like that?

653
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,878
No. You're right.

654
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,197
It would destroy us.

655
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,109
Tell your council that
the first battalions are ready.

656
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,478
And remind them,
if they need more troops...

657
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,592
it will take more time to grow them.

658
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,392
I won't forget, and thank you.

659
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,272
Thank you.

660
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,911
R4!

661
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:02,191
Scramble code five to Coruscant,
care of the old folks' home!

662
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:11,671
I have successfully made contact
with the prime minister of Kamino.

663
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:15,509
They are using a bounty hunter named
Jango Fett to create a clone army.

664
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,995
I have a strong feeling
that this bounty hunter...

665
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:20,111
is the assassin we are looking for.

666
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,117
Do you think these cloners
are involved...

667
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,196
in the plot to assassinate
Senator Amidala?

668
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,073
No, Master.
There appears to be no motive.

669
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,953
Do not assume anything, Obi-Wan.

670
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:32,913
Clear your mind must be...

671
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,033
if you are to discover
the real villains behind this plot.

672
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:38,912
Yes, Master.

673
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:41,952
They say Master Sifo-Dyas placed
an order for a clone army...

674
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:45,516
at the request of the senate
almost ten years ago.

675
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,999
I was under the impression
he was killed before that.

676
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:54,476
Did the council ever authorize
the creation of a clone army?

677
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,397
No. Whoever placed that order...

678
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,670
did not have the authorization
of the Jedi Council.

679
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:02,270
Bring him here.
Question him we will.

680
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:06,313
Yes, Master.
I will report back when I have him.

681
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:11,350
Blind we are if creation
of this clone army...

682
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,516
we could not see.

683
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:18,830
I think it is time
we informed the senate...

684
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:20,916
that our ability to use
the Force has diminished.

685
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,912
Only the dark lord of the Sith
knows of our weakness.

686
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,190
If informed the senate is...

687
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,675
multiply our adversaries will.

688
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,798
No.

689
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:38,997
Mom, no.

690
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,556
Don't go.

691
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,397
I don't want to disturb you.

692
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,557
Your presence is soothing.

693
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,351
You had another nightmare last night.

694
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,795
Jedi don't have nightmares.

695
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,231
I heard you.

696
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:32,871
I saw my mother.

697
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:37,751
She is suffering, Padmé.

698
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:43,192
I saw her as clearly as I see you now.

699
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:56,474
She is in pain.

700
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,751
I know I'm disobeying my mandate
to protect you, Senator...

701
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,791
but I have to go.

702
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,551
I have to help her.

703
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,031
I'll go with you.

704
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:13,310
I'm sorry.
I don't have a choice.

705
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,757
Dad, look!

706
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,669
Boba, get on board!

707
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,478
Oh, not good.

708
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:49,113
Wait right there.

709
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,151
Okey-okey.

710
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:55,032
Chut-chut, Watto.

711
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,110
Let me help you with that.

712
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:03,391
What? What do you want?

713
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:05,875
Wait! You're a Jedi!

714
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,037
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.

715
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:16,590
I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.

716
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:20,838
Ani?

717
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,352
Little Ani?

718
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,077
Nahhh.

719
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,394
You are Ani! It is you!

720
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:37,877
You sure sprouted, huh?

721
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:41,114
AJedi! Whattaya know!

722
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:47,949
Maybe you could help with some
deadbeats who owe me a lot of money.

723
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,479
My mother.

724
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,989
Oh, yeah. Shmi.

725
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:56,472
She's not mine-a no more-a.
I sold her.

726
01:02:56,600 --> 01:02:58,795
- You sold her?
- Years ago.

727
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,878
Sorry, Ani, but you know,
business is business.

728
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,555
I sold her to a moisture farmer
named Lars.

729
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:08,591
At least I think it was Lars.

730
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,076
Believe it or not, I heard
he freed her and married her!

731
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,395
Can ya beat that, eh?

732
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:18,756
Do you know where they are now?

733
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:21,631
Long way from here.

734
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:26,038
Someplace over on the other side
of Mos Eisley, I think.

735
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:28,071
I'd like to know.

736
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:32,319
Sure. Absolutely!

737
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,316
Let's go look at my records, huh?

738
01:04:02,560 --> 01:04:05,472
Dad!
I think we're being tracked!

739
01:04:05,600 --> 01:04:08,876
He must have put
a homing device on our hull.

740
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:11,150
Hang on, son.
We'll move into the asteroid field...

741
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,999
and we'll have
a couple of surprises for him.

742
01:04:24,560 --> 01:04:26,437
Seismic charges!

743
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:27,834
Stand by.

744
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,680
He doesn't seem
to take a hint, this guy.

745
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:13,719
Watch out!

746
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:35,274
Get him, Dad! Fire!

747
01:05:37,120 --> 01:05:39,554
Blast! This is why I hate flying!

748
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,233
We got him!

749
01:06:00,360 --> 01:06:02,271
We'll just have to finish him.

750
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:30,550
R4, prepare to jettison
the spare part canisters.

751
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,039
Fire them now!

752
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,075
We won't be seeing him again.

753
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,120
Well, R4, I think
we've waited long enough.

754
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,629
There's an unusual concentration
of Federation ships over there, R4.

755
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,151
Stay with the ship, R2.

756
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:43,909
Hello. How might I be
of service? I am C--

757
01:08:44,040 --> 01:08:45,837
3PO?

758
01:08:47,640 --> 01:08:49,392
The maker!

759
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:51,078
Master Ani!

760
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:53,873
I knew you would return.
I knew it!

761
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,638
And Miss Padmé. Oh, my.

762
01:08:55,760 --> 01:08:57,273
Hello, 3PO.

763
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:01,109
Bless my circuits!
I'm so pleased to see you both.

764
01:09:01,240 --> 01:09:03,117
I've come to see my mother.

765
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:06,836
I think perhaps
we'd better go indoors.

766
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:13,992
Master Owen, might I present
two most important visitors.

767
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:16,315
I'm Anakin Skywalker.

768
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:19,078
Owen Lars.

769
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,270
- This is my girlfriend, Beru.
- Hello.

770
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:23,311
I'm Padmé.

771
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:25,955
I guess I'm your stepbrother.

772
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,833
I had a feeling
you might show up someday.

773
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,238
Is my mother here?

774
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:32,998
No, she's not.

775
01:09:34,160 --> 01:09:35,798
Cliegg Lars.

776
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,831
Shmi is my wife.

777
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,798
We should go inside.
We have a lot to talk about.

778
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:52,078
It was just before dawn.
They came out of nowhere.

779
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:54,953
A hunting party of Tusken Raiders.

780
01:09:55,920 --> 01:09:58,673
Your mother had gone out early,
like she always did...

781
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:02,031
to pick mushrooms
that grow on the vaporators.

782
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:06,110
From the tracks,
she was about halfway home...

783
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:08,037
when they took her.

784
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:11,556
Those Tuskens walk like men...

785
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:16,071
but they're vicious, mindless monsters.

786
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:20,752
Thirty of us went out after her.
Four of us came back.

787
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:25,639
I'd be out there with them,
but after I lost my leg...

788
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:31,153
I just couldn't ride any more
until I heal.

789
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,877
I don't want to give up on her...

790
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,719
but she's been gone a month.

791
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,718
There's little hope
she's lasted this long.

792
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,197
Where are you going?

793
01:10:46,680 --> 01:10:48,636
To find my mother.

794
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:52,519
Your mother's dead, son.
Accept it.

795
01:11:13,800 --> 01:11:16,633
You're gonna have to stay here.

796
01:11:16,760 --> 01:11:19,320
These are good people, Padmé.
You'll be safe.

797
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:33,317
I won't be long.

798
01:13:17,840 --> 01:13:19,751
We must persuade
the Commerce Guild...

799
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:22,155
and the Corporate Alliance
to sign the treaty.

800
01:13:22,280 --> 01:13:24,953
What about the senator
from Naboo?

801
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:27,516
Is she dead yet?

802
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,954
I am not signing your treaty
until I have her head on my desk.

803
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:34,275
I am a man of my word, Viceroy.

804
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:37,312
With these new battle droids
we've built for you...

805
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:40,477
you'll have the finest army
in the galaxy.

806
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,757
As I explained to you earlier...

807
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:55,952
I am quite convinced
that 1 0,000 more systems...

808
01:13:56,080 --> 01:13:58,753
will rally to our cause
with your support, gentlemen.

809
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,478
What you are proposing
could be construed as treason.

810
01:14:03,400 --> 01:14:05,038
The Techno Union army...

811
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,799
is at your disposal, Count.

812
01:14:11,640 --> 01:14:14,996
The Banking Clan will sign your treaty.

813
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:16,917
Good. Very good.

814
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,276
Our friends from the Trade Federation
have pledged their support...

815
01:14:21,640 --> 01:14:23,995
and when their battle droids
are combined with yours...

816
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:27,152
we shall have an army
greater than any in the galaxy.

817
01:14:27,960 --> 01:14:30,554
The Jedi will be overwhelmed.

818
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:35,229
The Republic will agree
to any demands we make.

819
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,511
Mom?

820
01:15:37,840 --> 01:15:39,717
Ani?

821
01:15:40,920 --> 01:15:42,638
Ani?

822
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,398
Is it you?

823
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,956
I'm here, Mom. You're safe.

824
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:57,913
You look so handsome.

825
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:03,191
My son.

826
01:16:03,320 --> 01:16:05,959
My grown-up son.

827
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,590
I'm so proud of you, Ani.

828
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,551
I missed you.

829
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,191
Now I am complete.

830
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:24,878
I love y--

831
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:29,032
Stay with me, Mom. Everything--

832
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:31,116
I love--

833
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:34,955
I love--

834
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,676
Anakin!

835
01:17:32,200 --> 01:17:33,599
No!

836
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:54,718
What is it?

837
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:59,070
Pain, suffering...

838
01:17:59,640 --> 01:18:01,551
death I feel.

839
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,912
Something terrible has happened.

840
01:18:11,480 --> 01:18:14,358
Young Skywalker is in pain...

841
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:16,277
terrible pain.

842
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:24,350
The transmitter is working,
but we're not receiving a return signal.

843
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:27,074
Coruscant's too far.
R4, can you boost the power?

844
01:18:28,600 --> 01:18:30,511
We'll have to try something else.

845
01:18:33,320 --> 01:18:35,993
Maybe we can contact Anakin
on Naboo.

846
01:18:36,320 --> 01:18:37,912
It's much closer.

847
01:18:39,640 --> 01:18:41,870
Anakin, do you copy?

848
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:44,833
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi. Anakin?

849
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:47,190
He's not on Naboo, R4.

850
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,750
I'm going to try and widen the range.

851
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,917
I do hope nothing's happened to him.

852
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:04,917
That's Anakin's tracking signal,
all right...

853
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:07,395
but it's coming from Tatooine.

854
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:11,388
What in the blazes is he doing there?

855
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,397
I told him to stay on Naboo.

856
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:18,349
We haven't got much time.

857
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,436
Anakin, do you copy?

858
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,516
This is Obi-Wan Kenobi.

859
01:19:30,120 --> 01:19:31,951
Retransmit this message--

860
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:36,474
Anakin, do you copy?

861
01:19:36,600 --> 01:19:38,830
My long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

862
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,190
Retransmit this message to Coruscant.

863
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,831
I brought you something.

864
01:20:25,960 --> 01:20:27,996
Are you hungry?

865
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:31,557
The shifter broke.

866
01:20:33,360 --> 01:20:36,033
Life seems so much simpler
when you're fixing things.

867
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,756
I'm good at fixing things.
Always was.

868
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:45,877
But I couldn't--

869
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:51,551
Why'd she have to die?

870
01:20:54,920 --> 01:20:56,911
Why couldn't I save her?

871
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:58,996
I know I could have!

872
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:04,154
Sometimes there are things
no one can fix.

873
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:08,320
- You're not all-powerful, Ani.
- Well, I should be!

874
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:12,871
Someday I will be.

875
01:21:13,200 --> 01:21:15,714
I will be the most powerful Jedi ever.

876
01:21:17,360 --> 01:21:19,316
I promise you.

877
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:22,270
I will even learn
to stop people from dying.

878
01:21:25,920 --> 01:21:29,708
It's all Obi-Wan's fault!
He's jealous!

879
01:21:29,840 --> 01:21:31,796
He's holding me back!

880
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,956
What's wrong, Ani?

881
01:21:48,280 --> 01:21:50,157
I killed them.

882
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:53,717
I killed them all.

883
01:21:55,480 --> 01:21:57,277
They're dead.

884
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:59,391
Every single one of them.

885
01:22:01,480 --> 01:22:03,357
And not just the men...

886
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:07,151
but the women...

887
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:09,111
and the children too.

888
01:22:10,040 --> 01:22:11,996
They're like animals...

889
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:14,350
and I slaughtered them like animals!

890
01:22:15,920 --> 01:22:17,831
I hate them!

891
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:36,837
To be angry is to be human.

892
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:38,757
I'm a Jedi.

893
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:41,637
I know I'm better than this.

894
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:59,392
I know wherever you are
it's become a better place.

895
01:22:59,800 --> 01:23:04,430
You were the most loving partner
a man could ever have.

896
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,236
Goodbye, my darling wife.

897
01:23:13,080 --> 01:23:14,911
And thank you.

898
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,270
I wasn't strong enough
to save you, Mom.

899
01:23:45,680 --> 01:23:47,477
I wasn't strong enough.

900
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,077
But I promise I won't fail again.

901
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:07,556
I miss you...

902
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,711
so much.

903
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,960
R2? What are you doing here?

904
01:24:22,760 --> 01:24:26,799
It seems that he is carrying
a message from an Obi-Wan Kenobi.

905
01:24:27,760 --> 01:24:30,752
Master Ani, does that name
mean anything to you?

906
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,149
Anakin, my long-range transmitter
has been knocked out.

907
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:37,430
Retransmit this message
to Coruscant.

908
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,876
I have tracked the bounty hunter,
Jango Fett...

909
01:24:44,000 --> 01:24:46,036
to the droid foundries on Geonosis.

910
01:24:46,160 --> 01:24:49,630
The Trade Federation is
to take delivery of a droid army here...

911
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:51,671
and it is clear that Viceroy Gunray...

912
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,110
is behind the assassination attempts
on Senator Amidala.

913
01:24:55,240 --> 01:24:57,276
The Commerce Guilds
and the Corporate Alliance...

914
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,915
have both pledged their armies
to Count Dooku and are forming--

915
01:25:01,040 --> 01:25:02,996
Wait.

916
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:17,837
More happening on Geonosis, I feel,
than has been revealed.

917
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,632
I agree.

918
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:23,150
We will deal with Count Dooku.

919
01:25:23,280 --> 01:25:26,670
The most important thing for you
is to stay where you are.

920
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:29,394
Protect the senator at all costs.

921
01:25:29,520 --> 01:25:31,954
That is your first priority.

922
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:35,277
Understood, Master.

923
01:25:35,400 --> 01:25:37,311
They'll never get there
in time to save him.

924
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:40,352
They have to come halfway
across the galaxy. Look.

925
01:25:42,480 --> 01:25:44,471
Geonosis is less than a parsec away.

926
01:25:44,600 --> 01:25:46,477
If he's still alive.

927
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,834
Are you just gonna sit here
and let him die?

928
01:25:50,960 --> 01:25:53,349
- He's your friend, your mentor.
- He's like my father!

929
01:25:54,520 --> 01:25:58,035
But you heard Master Windu.
He gave me strict orders to stay here.

930
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:01,232
He gave you strict orders
to protect me...

931
01:26:01,360 --> 01:26:03,476
and I'm going to help Obi-Wan.

932
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:08,190
If you plan to protect me,
you'll just have to come along.

933
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:15,117
I'm not worried, R2.
It's just I've never flown before.

934
01:26:25,000 --> 01:26:27,798
The Commerce Guilds are preparing
for war. There can be no doubt of that.

935
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:29,797
Count Dooku must have made
a treaty with them.

936
01:26:29,920 --> 01:26:33,151
The debate is over.

937
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:36,113
Now we need that clone army.

938
01:26:36,240 --> 01:26:39,038
Unfortunately,
the debate is not over.

939
01:26:39,160 --> 01:26:41,469
The senate will never approve
the use of clones...

940
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:43,272
before the separatists attack.

941
01:26:43,400 --> 01:26:45,197
This is a crisis.

942
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:48,278
The senate must vote the chancellor
emergency powers.

943
01:26:48,400 --> 01:26:51,358
He can then approve
the creation of an army.

944
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,750
But what senator would have
the courage...

945
01:26:53,880 --> 01:26:56,314
to propose such a radical amendment?

946
01:26:56,440 --> 01:27:00,353
If only Senator Amidala were here.

947
01:27:20,880 --> 01:27:22,632
Traitor.

948
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,157
Oh, no, my friend.
This is a mistake, a terrible mistake.

949
01:27:26,280 --> 01:27:28,236
They have gone too far.
This is madness.

950
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:30,828
I thought you were
the leader here, Dooku.

951
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,428
This had nothing to do with me,
I assure you.

952
01:27:33,560 --> 01:27:36,836
I will petition immediately
to have you set free.

953
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:40,430
Well, I hope it doesn't take too long.
I have work to do.

954
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:44,189
May I ask why a Jedi knight...

955
01:27:44,320 --> 01:27:46,629
is all the way out here on Geonosis?

956
01:27:46,760 --> 01:27:49,513
I've been tracking a bounty hunter
named Jango Fett.

957
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,437
Do you know him?

958
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,994
There are no bounty hunters here
that I am aware of.

959
01:27:54,120 --> 01:27:55,951
The Geonosians don't trust them.

960
01:27:56,080 --> 01:27:58,833
Who can blame them?
But he is here, I can assure you.

961
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:03,913
It's a great pity our paths
have never crossed before, Obi-Wan.

962
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:06,915
Qui-Gon always spoke
very highly of you.

963
01:28:11,600 --> 01:28:13,556
I wish he were still alive.

964
01:28:14,960 --> 01:28:17,554
I could use his help right now.

965
01:28:18,640 --> 01:28:20,756
Qui-Gon Jinn would never join you.

966
01:28:22,560 --> 01:28:25,233
Don't be so sure, my young Jedi.

967
01:28:25,360 --> 01:28:27,794
You forget that he was once
my apprentice...

968
01:28:27,920 --> 01:28:29,876
just as you were once his.

969
01:28:30,800 --> 01:28:32,916
He knew all about the corruption
in the senate...

970
01:28:33,040 --> 01:28:35,918
but he wouldn't have gone along with
it if he had learned the truth as I have.

971
01:28:36,040 --> 01:28:38,679
- The truth?
- The truth.

972
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:47,991
What if I told you that the Republic
was now under the control...

973
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,076
of the dark lord of the Sith?

974
01:28:50,200 --> 01:28:52,919
No, that's not possible.
The Jedi would be aware of it.

975
01:28:53,040 --> 01:28:57,113
The dark side of the Force
has clouded their vision, my friend.

976
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,634
Hundreds of senators
are now under the influence...

977
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:05,151
of a Sith lord called Darth Sidious.

978
01:29:06,240 --> 01:29:07,753
I don't believe you.

979
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:10,110
The viceroy of the Trade Federation...

980
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,312
was once in league
with this Darth Sidious...

981
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:17,835
but he was betrayed
ten years ago by the dark lord.

982
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:20,918
He came to me for help.
He told me everything.

983
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:24,836
You must join me, Obi-Wan...

984
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,788
and together we will destroy the Sith!

985
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,675
I will never join you, Dooku.

986
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:45,598
It may be difficult
to secure your release.

987
01:29:53,120 --> 01:29:55,873
It's-a clear
desa separatists made a pact...

988
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,514
wesa desa Federation du Trade.

989
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:02,758
Senators, "dellow felagates'':

990
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:06,714
In response to this direct threat
to the Republic...

991
01:30:06,840 --> 01:30:10,355
mesa propose that the senate...

992
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:13,950
give immediately emergency powers...

993
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,594
to the supreme chancellor.

994
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,556
Palpatine! Palpatine!

995
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:28,637
Order! We shall have order!

996
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:33,431
It is with great reluctance...

997
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,551
that I have agreed to this calling.

998
01:30:36,880 --> 01:30:40,668
I love democracy.
I love the Republic.

999
01:30:41,520 --> 01:30:43,590
The power you give me...

1000
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:48,032
I will lay down
when this crisis has abated.

1001
01:30:52,360 --> 01:30:56,956
And as my first act
with this new authority...

1002
01:30:57,080 --> 01:31:01,278
I will create
a grand army of the Republic...

1003
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:04,995
to counter the increasing threats
of the separatists.

1004
01:31:06,320 --> 01:31:08,117
It is done, then.

1005
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:16,715
I will take what Jedi we have left
and go to Geonosis and help Obi-Wan.

1006
01:31:16,840 --> 01:31:20,549
Visit I will the cloners on Kamino...

1007
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,109
and see this army
they have created for the Republic.

1008
01:31:44,920 --> 01:31:46,876
See those columns of steam
straight ahead?

1009
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:48,956
They're exhaust vents of some type.

1010
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,677
That'll do.

1011
01:32:00,760 --> 01:32:03,558
Look, whatever happens
out there, follow my lead.

1012
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,671
I'm not interested
in getting into a war here.

1013
01:32:05,800 --> 01:32:07,597
As a member of the senate...

1014
01:32:07,720 --> 01:32:10,439
maybe I can find
a diplomatic solution to this mess.

1015
01:32:10,800 --> 01:32:12,677
Don't worry.

1016
01:32:12,920 --> 01:32:15,115
I've given up
trying to argue with you.

1017
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,752
My obtuse little friend,
if they had needed our help...

1018
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:24,677
they would have asked for it.

1019
01:32:24,800 --> 01:32:27,792
You obviously have a great deal
to learn about human behaviour.

1020
01:32:52,640 --> 01:32:55,677
For a mechanic, you seem to do
an excessive amount of thinking.

1021
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,148
I am programmed
to understand humans!

1022
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,397
"What does that mean?''

1023
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:08,114
That means I am in charge here!

1024
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:09,798
Where are you going now?

1025
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:13,276
You don't know what's out there.
Have you no sense at all?

1026
01:33:13,640 --> 01:33:15,232
Idiot!

1027
01:33:17,360 --> 01:33:19,032
Please wait.

1028
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:21,631
Do you know where you're going?

1029
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,318
Wait.

1030
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:49,638
Oh, my goodness!

1031
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,239
Shut me down!

1032
01:34:52,320 --> 01:34:54,197
Machines making machines.

1033
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:55,719
How perverse!

1034
01:34:56,640 --> 01:34:57,993
Calm down, R2!

1035
01:34:58,120 --> 01:35:00,475
I almost fell.

1036
01:35:00,600 --> 01:35:02,477
You'll get your chance--

1037
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:06,152
I'm scrap.

1038
01:35:07,200 --> 01:35:09,475
It's a nightmare!

1039
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,077
I want to go home!

1040
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:16,357
What did I do to deserve this?

1041
01:35:54,680 --> 01:35:56,796
I wonder what happened
to poor little R2.

1042
01:35:56,920 --> 01:35:59,195
He's always getting himself
into trouble.

1043
01:36:00,520 --> 01:36:02,033
Oh, no!

1044
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:12,638
Uh-oh.

1045
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,997
I'm so confused.

1046
01:38:09,160 --> 01:38:10,912
Not again!

1047
01:38:11,240 --> 01:38:13,117
Obi-Wan's gonna kill me.

1048
01:38:21,880 --> 01:38:23,233
Don't move,Jedi!

1049
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,793
Take him away.

1050
01:38:43,040 --> 01:38:44,792
Don't be afraid.

1051
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:48,391
I'm not afraid to die.

1052
01:38:53,040 --> 01:38:56,999
I've been dying a little bit each day
since you came back into my life.

1053
01:38:58,240 --> 01:39:00,674
What are you talking about?

1054
01:39:02,120 --> 01:39:04,076
I love you.

1055
01:39:07,720 --> 01:39:09,597
You love me?

1056
01:39:13,880 --> 01:39:16,997
I thought we had decided
not to fall in love...

1057
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,558
that we would be forced
to live a lie...

1058
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:25,278
and that it would destroy our lives.

1059
01:39:26,160 --> 01:39:28,310
I think our lives are about
to be destroyed anyway.

1060
01:39:33,240 --> 01:39:34,992
I truly...

1061
01:39:35,960 --> 01:39:38,269
deeply love you...

1062
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,908
and before we die,
I want you to know.

1063
01:40:36,720 --> 01:40:39,234
I was beginning to wonder
if you'd got my message.

1064
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:42,272
I retransmitted it
just as you had requested, Master.

1065
01:40:44,560 --> 01:40:46,357
Then we decided
to come and rescue you.

1066
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:48,759
Good job.

1067
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:03,512
Settle down. Settle down.

1068
01:41:07,360 --> 01:41:10,909
Let the executions begin.

1069
01:41:42,360 --> 01:41:45,158
I've got a bad feeling about this.

1070
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:12,069
-Just relax. Concentrate.
- What about Padmé?

1071
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:14,236
She seems to be on top of things.

1072
01:43:14,640 --> 01:43:16,278
She can't do that!

1073
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,231
Shoot her... or something!

1074
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,193
Jump!

1075
01:44:58,320 --> 01:45:01,710
This isn't how it's supposed to be!

1076
01:45:01,840 --> 01:45:03,398
Jango! Finish her off!

1077
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:06,592
Patience, Viceroy, patience.
She will die.

1078
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:37,599
Master Windu.

1079
01:45:37,720 --> 01:45:39,915
How pleasant of you to join us.

1080
01:45:40,040 --> 01:45:41,951
This party's over.

1081
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:57,150
Brave...

1082
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,510
but foolish, my old Jedi friend.

1083
01:45:59,640 --> 01:46:01,392
You're impossibly outnumbered.

1084
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:03,750
I don't think so.

1085
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:05,233
We'll see.

1086
01:46:42,400 --> 01:46:44,868
My legs aren't moving.
I must need maintenance.

1087
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:25,355
What's all this noise?
A battle!

1088
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:27,550
There's been some terrible mistake!

1089
01:47:27,680 --> 01:47:30,274
I'm programmed for etiquette,
not destruction!

1090
01:48:54,240 --> 01:48:55,992
Die,Jedi dogs!

1091
01:48:56,120 --> 01:48:57,792
Oh! What did I say?

1092
01:49:06,520 --> 01:49:09,671
Oh, dear.
I'm terribly sorry about all this.

1093
01:49:15,120 --> 01:49:17,918
Excuse me. I'm trapped.
I can't get up.

1094
01:49:31,800 --> 01:49:35,156
- You call this a diplomatic solution?
- No, I call it aggressive negotiations.

1095
01:49:40,080 --> 01:49:41,957
- Uh-oh.
- Roger, roger.

1096
01:49:59,400 --> 01:50:01,550
R2, what are you doing here?

1097
01:50:04,640 --> 01:50:05,914
What are you doing?

1098
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:08,554
Stop that!
You're going to strain something.

1099
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:10,352
My neck!

1100
01:50:12,560 --> 01:50:15,472
Now where are you taking me?
This is such a drag!

1101
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:22,236
I'm quite beside myself.

1102
01:50:30,600 --> 01:50:33,672
R2, please be careful!
You're singeing my circuits!

1103
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:37,469
Yes, but is my head on straight?

1104
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:00,878
Master Windu...

1105
01:51:01,000 --> 01:51:03,116
you have fought gallantly...

1106
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:08,119
worthy of recognition
in the archives of the Jedi order.

1107
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:11,228
Now...

1108
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:14,475
it is finished.

1109
01:51:14,600 --> 01:51:16,352
Surrender...

1110
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,194
and your lives will be spared.

1111
01:51:20,040 --> 01:51:22,998
We will not be hostages
to be bartered, Dooku!

1112
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:24,109
Then...

1113
01:51:25,520 --> 01:51:27,511
I'm sorry, old friend.

1114
01:51:37,760 --> 01:51:39,113
Look!

1115
01:51:50,640 --> 01:51:54,428
Around the survivors
a perimeter create.

1116
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:51,558
I've had the most peculiar dream!

1117
01:53:01,760 --> 01:53:03,637
If Dooku escapes...

1118
01:53:03,760 --> 01:53:07,309
rally more systems
to his cause he will.

1119
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,432
Hold on!

1120
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,677
Aim right above the fuel cells!

1121
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:27,910
Good call, my young Padawan.

1122
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,795
The Jedi have amassed a huge army.

1123
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:45,911
That doesn't seem possible.

1124
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:48,589
How could the Jedi
come up with an army so quickly?

1125
01:53:48,880 --> 01:53:51,952
We must send
all available droids into battle.

1126
01:53:52,080 --> 01:53:53,911
There are too many.

1127
01:53:54,840 --> 01:53:57,479
Our communications have been jammed.

1128
01:54:05,360 --> 01:54:08,158
Pilot, land in that assembly area!

1129
01:54:08,280 --> 01:54:09,508
Yes, sir.

1130
01:54:17,280 --> 01:54:18,474
Sir...

1131
01:54:18,600 --> 01:54:21,114
I have five special commando units
awaiting your orders, sir.

1132
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:25,231
To the forward command centre
take me.

1133
01:54:47,600 --> 01:54:50,239
Attack those Federation starships,
quickly!

1134
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:04,389
Master Yoda,
all forward positions are advancing.

1135
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:06,272
Very good.

1136
01:55:06,920 --> 01:55:08,478
Very good.

1137
01:55:35,520 --> 01:55:37,511
This is not looking good at all!

1138
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:41,877
We must get the starships
back into space.

1139
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:48,554
We have to order a retreat.

1140
01:55:48,680 --> 01:55:50,910
My master will never allow
the Republic...

1141
01:55:51,040 --> 01:55:53,235
to get away with this treachery.

1142
01:55:53,400 --> 01:55:56,472
I'm sending my warriors
to hide in the catacombs.

1143
01:55:56,600 --> 01:56:00,479
The Jedi must not find
our designs for the ultimate weapon.

1144
01:56:02,800 --> 01:56:07,874
If they find out what we are planning
to build, we're doomed.

1145
01:56:11,000 --> 01:56:13,309
I will take the designs
with me to Coruscant.

1146
01:56:14,240 --> 01:56:16,834
They will be much safer there
with my master.

1147
01:57:09,160 --> 01:57:13,711
Concentrate all your fire
on the nearest starship.

1148
01:57:13,840 --> 01:57:15,592
Yes, sir.

1149
01:57:15,720 --> 01:57:19,030
Move all quadrants to sector 51 5.

1150
01:57:57,520 --> 01:57:58,919
Look over there!

1151
01:58:02,280 --> 01:58:04,555
It's Dooku! Shoot him down!

1152
01:58:04,680 --> 01:58:06,477
We're out of rockets, sir.

1153
01:58:06,600 --> 01:58:09,319
- Follow him!
- We're gonna need some help!

1154
01:58:09,640 --> 01:58:13,315
There isn't time!
Anakin and I can handle this!

1155
01:58:35,840 --> 01:58:38,308
Put the ship down!

1156
01:58:38,440 --> 01:58:40,237
Don't let your personal feelings
get in the way!

1157
01:58:40,360 --> 01:58:42,032
Follow that speeder!

1158
01:58:47,880 --> 01:58:50,110
- Lower the ship!
- I can't take Dooku alone!

1159
01:58:50,240 --> 01:58:53,550
I need you! If we catch him,
we can end this war right now!

1160
01:58:53,680 --> 01:58:56,558
- We have a job to do!
- I don't care! Put the ship down!

1161
01:58:56,680 --> 01:58:58,830
You will be expelled
from the Jedi order!

1162
01:58:58,960 --> 01:59:02,032
- I can't leave her!
- Come to your senses!

1163
01:59:02,160 --> 01:59:04,674
What do you think Padmé would do
were she in your position?

1164
01:59:09,160 --> 01:59:11,071
She would do her duty.

1165
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:21,676
The droid army is in full retreat.

1166
01:59:21,800 --> 01:59:24,758
Well done, Commander.
Bring me a ship.

1167
01:59:50,640 --> 01:59:53,632
You're gonna pay for all the Jedi
that you killed today, Dooku.

1168
01:59:53,760 --> 01:59:55,352
We'll take him together.

1169
01:59:55,480 --> 01:59:57,357
- I'm taking him now!
- No, Anakin! No!

1170
02:00:05,200 --> 02:00:08,556
As you see, my Jedi powers
are far beyond yours.

1171
02:00:08,680 --> 02:00:10,511
Now... back down.

1172
02:00:16,120 --> 02:00:17,872
I don't think so.

1173
02:00:30,320 --> 02:00:32,754
Master Kenobi, you disappoint me.

1174
02:00:32,880 --> 02:00:35,838
Yoda holds you in such high esteem.

1175
02:00:38,120 --> 02:00:40,429
Surely you can do better.

1176
02:00:51,160 --> 02:00:52,957
Are you all right?

1177
02:00:53,080 --> 02:00:54,672
Uh-huh.

1178
02:00:55,280 --> 02:00:57,430
We'd better get back
to the forward command centre.

1179
02:00:57,560 --> 02:00:59,073
No.

1180
02:00:59,200 --> 02:01:02,556
Gather what troops you can.
We've got to get to that hangar.

1181
02:01:02,680 --> 02:01:04,557
Get a transport. Hurry!

1182
02:01:04,680 --> 02:01:05,669
Right away.

1183
02:01:29,800 --> 02:01:31,552
Brave of you, boy.

1184
02:01:32,800 --> 02:01:34,916
But I would have thought
you had learned your lesson.

1185
02:01:35,040 --> 02:01:36,553
I am a slow learner.

1186
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:38,152
Master Yoda.

1187
02:02:38,280 --> 02:02:41,192
Count Dooku.

1188
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:44,517
You have interfered with our affairs
for the last time.

1189
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:17,358
Powerful you have become, Dooku.

1190
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:20,798
The dark side I sense in you.

1191
02:03:20,920 --> 02:03:23,593
I've become more powerful
than any Jedi.

1192
02:03:24,680 --> 02:03:26,238
Even you.

1193
02:03:41,000 --> 02:03:43,912
Much to learn you still have.

1194
02:03:44,040 --> 02:03:47,077
It is obvious that this contest
cannot be decided...

1195
02:03:47,200 --> 02:03:49,350
by our knowledge of the Force...

1196
02:03:51,320 --> 02:03:53,788
but by our skills with a lightsabre.

1197
02:04:33,880 --> 02:04:36,952
Fought well you have,
my old Padawan.

1198
02:04:37,080 --> 02:04:38,752
This is just the beginning.

1199
02:07:05,680 --> 02:07:08,035
The Force is with us, Master Sidious.

1200
02:07:08,400 --> 02:07:10,994
Welcome home, Lord Tyranus.

1201
02:07:12,800 --> 02:07:15,030
You have done well.

1202
02:07:15,480 --> 02:07:17,391
I have good news for you, my lord.

1203
02:07:18,840 --> 02:07:21,752
- The war has begun.
- Excellent.

1204
02:07:22,320 --> 02:07:24,914
Everything is going as planned.

1205
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:38,268
Do you believe what Count Dooku said
about Sidious controlling the senate?

1206
02:07:38,800 --> 02:07:40,711
It doesn't feel right.

1207
02:07:41,040 --> 02:07:43,873
Joined the dark side Dooku has.

1208
02:07:45,160 --> 02:07:46,798
Lies, deceit...

1209
02:07:46,920 --> 02:07:50,515
creating mistrust are his ways now.

1210
02:07:50,640 --> 02:07:51,993
Nevertheless..

1211
02:07:52,120 --> 02:07:54,759
I feel we should keep
a closer eye on the senate.

1212
02:07:55,120 --> 02:07:57,076
I agree.

1213
02:07:58,160 --> 02:07:59,957
Where is your apprentice?

1214
02:08:00,080 --> 02:08:03,789
On his way to Naboo,
escorting Senator Amidala home.

1215
02:08:05,520 --> 02:08:08,751
I have to admit that without the clones,
it would not have been a victory.

1216
02:08:09,120 --> 02:08:11,076
Victory?

1217
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:14,195
Victory, you say?

1218
02:08:14,320 --> 02:08:17,869
Master Obi-Wan, not victory.

1219
02:08:19,360 --> 02:08:22,432
The shroud of the dark side has fallen.

1220
02:08:24,040 --> 02:08:27,396
Begun the Clone War has.

EXT. NABOO LAKE RETREAT, LODGE, GARDEN - LATE DAY
In a rose-covered arbor overlooking the sparkling late, ANAKIN and PADME stand before a NABOO HOLY MAN.

THREEPIO and ARTOO stand by, watching, as the HOLY MAN blesses the happy couple and, amid gently falling rose petals, ANAKIN and PADME kiss.

EXT. CORUSCANT, MILITARY STAGING AREA, BALCONY - LATE DAY
PALPATINE, JAR JAR, BAIL ORGANA and the OTHER SENATORS, with TWO ROYAL GUARDS, stand looking down at the square below.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS are drawn up in a strict formation or move forwards in near files to climb the ramps of the Military Assault Ships.

On the balcony, PALPATINE'S expression is deeply sad. Everyone watches comberly as, in the square, loaded Assault Ships take off. Other land immediately in their place. The sky above is thick with transports. CLONE TROOPS march and board the Ships.

The Great Clone War has begun...

FADE OUT:

THE END

STAR WARS EPISODE 3: REVENGE OF THE SITH SCRIPT

George Lucas


1 EXT. SPACE

A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.

A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity.

          War! The Republic is crumbling
          under attacks by the ruthless
          Sith Lord, Count Dooku.
          There are heroes on both sides.
          Evil is everywhere.

          In a stunning move, the
          fiendish droid leader, General
          Grievous, has swept into the
          Republic capital and kidnapped
          Chancellor Palpatine, leader of
          the Galactic Senate.

          As the Separatist Droid Army
          attempts to flee the besieged
          capital with their valuable
          hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a
          desperate mission to rescue the
          captive Chancellor....

PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet.

2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently.

3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER.

ANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . .

OBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . .

4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE

The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame.

5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship.

OBI-WAN: We've got to split them up.

ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower.

OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow.

OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait?

ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you.

OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me!

ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES.

ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo!

ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning.

ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo.

OBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck.

ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver.

OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on!

ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER.

OBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this!

OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch!

R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down.

ANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . .

ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo.

OBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ...

R-4 BEEPS a blue streak.

ANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead.

ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit.

ANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids.

6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

OBI-WAN: I see it. Oh, this is going to be easy.

Ahead is a TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER with batlike DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS stalking around on the hull. The VULTURE FIGHTERS transform into flight configuration, lift off the CRUISER, and attack the JEDI STARFIGHTERS.

ANAKIN: Come on, Master.

OBI-WAN: Not this time. There's too much at stake. We need help. Odd Ball, do you copy?

ODD BALL: (OS) Copy, Red Leader.

OBI-WAN: Mark my position and form your squad up behind me . . .

7 INT. ODD BALL'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ODD BALL: We're on your tail, General Kenobi. Set S-foils in attack position.

The protective ray shield lowers on the main hangar of the TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER, and six new DROID TRI-FIGHTERS emerge and join the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS heading toward the Jedi. The JEDI STARFIGHTERS extend the stability foils on the ends of their wings.

8 INT. ANAKIN'S FIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE

ANAKIN: This is where the fun begins. Ten Vulture Droids straight ahead, coming down the left side.

ARTOO BEEPS a worried message.

OBI-WAN: Add five Tri-fighters on the right . . .

ANAKIN: I'm going head to head. See you.

OBI-WAN: Take it easy, Anakin.

Four Clone Fighters move into formation behind the Jedi.

ODD BALL: I'm on your right, Red Leader.

ANAKIN: Incoming!!

ARTOO SQUEALS as five DROID TRI-FIGHTERS pass by at high speed on the right.

OBI-WAN: Five more on the right!

Four more VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS pass at high speed from the left. All hell breaks loose. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue to fly in unison, backing up each other. ARTOO SQUEALS.

ANAKIN: Here we go.

The Jedi ships split up and make a quick loop around the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, ending up behind them. BLASTING away. The DROID TRI-FIGHTERS EXPLODE.

OBI-WAN: I'm going high and right.

ANAKIN: Hang on. There are four more of them.

OBI-WAN: Stay with me . . . swing back and right . . . help me engage. Back off ... Let them pass between us.

ANAKIN: I'm coming around. I'm coming around on your tail.

OBI-WAN: All right, engage . . . and hurry. These droids are all over me like a rash.

In one incredible move, ANAKIN swings in behind the DROID TRI-FIGHTERS, blowing them away one by one until there is only one left. ARTOO CHIRPS.

ARTOO lets out a HOWL as ANAKIN accelerates past the last DROID TRI-FIGHTER, slams on his brakes, flips the Fighter around, and BLASTS the Fighter from the front. ARTOO BEEPS frantically as they fly through the debris of the destroyed ships. ANAKIN looks behind him.

ANAKIN: How many back there. Artoo? (Artoo beeps) Three . . . (continuing) Four . . . that's not good.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, you have four on your tail.

ANAKIN: I know. I know!

OBI-WAN: Four more closing from your left.

ANAKIN: I know. I know!

OBI-WAN: Break right and go high.

ANAKIN: I'm going low and left.

Obi-Wan shakes his head.

OBI-WAN: (to himself) He still has much to learn.

ANAKIN swoops low and skims across a TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIP, dodging flack as ARTOO bounces along, trying to get out a sentence.

ANAKIN: Hang on, Artoo. Obi-Wan, do you copy? I'm going to pull them through the needle . . .

OBI-WAN: Too dangerous. First Jedi rule: "Survive."

ANAKIN: Sorry, no choice. Come down here and thin them out a little.

OBI-WAN drops in behind the DROID VULTURE FIGHTERS chasing Anakin. ARFOUR BEEPS to OBI-WAN.

OBI-WAN: Just keep me steady . . . hold on ... not yet. . . now break left.

OBI-WAN fires as he swings across the back of the VULTURE DROIDS, BLASTING four of them away. ANAKIN heads for a trench along the surface of one of the Trade Federation Battleships. He flies into the trench, which ends in a conning tower with a small slit between two main struts.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) You'll never get through there, Anakin. It's too tight.

ARTOO BEEPS nervously.

ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo . . . we've done this before.

OBI-WAN: Use the Force, think yourself through, the ship will follow.

ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT."

ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo.

ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through.

OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION.
A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space.
Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS.

ODD BALL: There are too many of them.

CLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . .

ANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out!

OBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship!

Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them.

ANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up!

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot.

OBI-WAN: They overshot us . . .

The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wans Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them.

ANAKIN: They're coming around!

OBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy.

ANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters.

ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide.

ANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo!

Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN: Flying is for droids.

Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin?

ANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids.

The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR.

OBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . .

ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away.

OBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls.

ANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them.

OBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here.

ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wans Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ...

ANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here.

ANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . .

OBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin.

ANAKIN: Move to the right.

OBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do.

ANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master.

ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view.

ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID.

OBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone.

ANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out!

OBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye.

ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship.

ANAKIN: Yeah, you got him!

OBI-WAN: Great, Artoo.

ANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar.

OBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up?

ANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master.

ANAKIN streaks ahead of OBI-WAN's disintegrating Jedi Fighter and blasts the shield generator. It SPARKS and EXPLODES.

OBI-WAN: Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.

9 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The shield door drops away, and OBI-WAN crashes on the deck of the hangar bay, engulfed in a FANTAIL OF SPARKS. A set of blast doors starts SLAMMING shut across the hangar opening, as material is sucked into space.

ANAKIN maneuvers around the oncoming junk and flies into the hangar just as the blast doors SLAM shut.
OBI-WAN ignites his light saber and cuts his way out of the cockpit. He jumps dear just as his ship EXPLODES. BATTLE DROIDS rush at him from all directions.

ANAKIN jumps out of his ship and cuts his way through the BATTLE DROIDS to where OBI-WAN is fighting. ARTOO pops out of the ship and follows ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: Artoo, locate the Chancellor.

ANAKIN: Tap into the ship's computers.

They cut down the last of the droids and follow ARTOO over to a computer wall socket. The two JEDI fight off FOUR MORE DROIDS as ARTOO tries to find the Chancellor. Finally, a HOLOGRAM of the Trade Federation ship appears.

OBI-WAN: The Chancellor's signal is coming from right there. The observation platform at the top of that spire.

ANAKIN: I sense Count Dooku . . .

OBI-WAN: I sense a trap.

ANAKIN: Next move?

OBI-WAN: Spring the trap.

The JEDI start to leave; ARTOO follows. The JEDI stop and turn to ARTOO.

ANAKIN: Artoo, go back. I need you to stay with the ship.

OBI-WAN: Here, take this, and wait for orders.

OBI-WAN tosses the comlink to ARTOO.

10 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the bridge of the TRADE FEDERATION cruiser followed by his TWO BODYGUARDS. He walks to the front of the bridge and stands in front of the NEIMOIDIAN CAPTAIN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: What's the situation, Captain?

CAPTAIN: TWO Jedi have landed in the main hangar bay.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Just as Count Dooku predicted.

11 INT. HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN head for the elevator. A door opens in the hallway and two of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS confront the JEDI.

BODYGUARD I: General Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker. We've been waiting for you.

OBI-WAN: We are here to relieve you of Chancellor Palpatine, not join him.

As a dozen more droids join the group, the JEDI ignite their lightsabers and stand back-to-back.

OBI-WAN: Anakin. . .

ANAKIN: Ready.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN use their lightsabers and cut a large circle in the floor.

12 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI cut their way down several floors into a large generator room. Huge EXPLOSIONS outside the ship have caused several large pipes overhead to break, and fluid is spewing everywhere. The Jedi get up and turn off their light sabers. ANAKIN dips his hand into the fluid and sniffs it.

OBI-WAN: . . . fuel. The slightest charge from our sabers will send this ship into oblivion. That's why they've stopped shooting.

ANAKIN: Well then, we're safe for the time being.

OBI-WAN: Your idea of safe is not the same as mine.

They run, EXPLOSIONS rattle the ship, and pipes continue to burst around them, spilling more fuel into the hallway. At the far end, SIX SUPER BATTLE DROIDS drop into the fuel. The SOUNDS OF SHIELD DOORS CLOSING AND LOCKING ECHO throughout the hallway. They pass several large power generators, which are topped with SPARKING excess power dischargers.

ANAKIN: They're sealing this section off.

OBI-WAN: Six droids coming our way!

The last of the DOORS CAN BE HEARD CLOSING in the distance.

ANAKIN: Keep moving. There must be vents . . . This way.

They move along a wall. ANAKIN climbs up the side to a small vent. The fuel gets closer to the SPARKING dischargers.

OBI-WAN: We'll never get through that. It's too small!

They move toward a second vent. OBI-WAN is swimming in the fuel as it reaches to within a couple yards of the ceiling. ANAKIN feels along the ceiling and finds another smaller vent. He closes his eyes and tries to sense an opening, then he moves on. OBI-WAN is forced into hand-to-hand combat with one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. It pulls the Jedi under the fuel. Just before he is about to drown, OBI-WAN disables the SUPER BATTLE DROID by pushing him into an exhaust pipe.

The fuel is up to the Jedi's chins. ANAKIN finds a very, very small metal grate, then pounds on it until the tiny grate breaks loose.

ANAKIN: I found our escape vent.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, this is no time for jokes. We're in serious trouble here.

ANAKIN: Only in your mind. My Master. Look, no structure. . . .

ANAKIN grabs the side of the tiny hole and gives it a big yank, ripping a large panel loose revealing a "man-sized" work shaft. They scramble through it as the DROIDS swim closer.

13 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube.

ANAKIN: Here's a way out.

As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch.

14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end.

15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword.

OBI-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers.

ANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized.

OBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin.

16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger.

SUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this.

17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION.

18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE

A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser.

19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed.

OBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go!

ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway.

20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times.

ANAKIN: Destroyers!!

Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them.

BATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em.

The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS.

21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

R2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter.

22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop.

OBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button?

ANAKIN: No, did you?

OBI-WAN: No!

ANAKIN: Well, there's more than one way out of here.

ANAKIN ignites his laser sword.

OBI-WAN: We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . .

ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling.

23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What's that?

SUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It's nothing.

24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN: Artoo?

ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move.

OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply.

25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface.

OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo.

26 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Suddenly, the elevator plummets down the shaft. ANAKIN quickly jumps and grabs onto the hallway entry door. He watches as the elevator recedes down the shaft and disappears. ANAKIN struggles to keep his grip on the closed door as SPARKING wires rain down on him.

27 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator starts to descend rapidly.

OBI-WAN: Stop, stop! Artoo, we need to be going up.

28 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Anakin struggles to hang on to the narrow edge of the elevator shaft. The door to the elevator shaft is pried open, and TWO BATTLE DROIDS appear in the doorway and look down at ANAKIN. They point their guns at him.

DROID 1: Hands up, Jedi! Don't move.

DROID 2: Roger, roger.

29 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS overhear OBI-WAN's comlink messages to ARTOO.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: There it is again.

OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, do you copy? Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we need to be going up, not down.

30 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator races down as OBI-WAN holds on.

OBI-WAN: Stop. Artoo! We need to go up! Stop, stop!

The elevator stops with a jolt. OBI-WAN falls to the floor.

31 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS see ARTOO and walk toward the little droid.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: Hey you!

ARTOO plugs into the interface again and the elevator shoots up.

32 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN stands up after having fallen in the elevator.

OBI-WAN: Now, that's better . . .

33 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO is held up by TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS, who chuckle as the little Astro Droid curses and swings at them.

SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: You stupid little astro droid!

34 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN looks down and sees the elevator heading toward him at a high rate of speed. He looks at the BATTLE DROIDS leaning over him with their guns pointed at him. He calculates for a moment, then gives himself a push and flips himself up into the elevator shaft.

Before ANAKIN can arc into a descent down the shaft, the elevator races up through the shaft, cutting the DROIDS in two. ANAKIN lands on the elevator and quickly drops back through the hole in the ceiling. OBI-WAN is startled and ignites his lightsaber.

OBI-WAN: Oh, it's you . . .

35 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO activates his oil hose and sprays the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip on the oil.

36 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN: What was that all about?

OBI-WAN: Well, Artoo has been . . .

ANAKIN: No loose wire jokes . . . He's doing the best he can.

OBI-WAN: Did I say anything?

ANAKIN: He's trying!

OBI-WAN: I didn't say anything!

37 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO ignites his arm rockets and shoots out of their grip, spraying them both with oil and setting them on fire. The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS slip and slide until they fall, smoldering. ARTOO rolls away.

38 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTER'S-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

The elevator door opens and the TWO JEDI carefully make their way into the main room of the General's Quarters.
At the far end sits SUPREME CHANCELLOR PALPATINE. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move toward the CHANCELLOR.
As they get closer to PALPATINE, they see a very distressed look on the Chancellor's face.

OBI-WAN: (bows) Chancellor.

ANAKIN: Are you all right?

PALPATINE: (quietly) Count Dooku.

PALPATINE makes a small gesture with his hand. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN turn around. The elevator DOORS CAN BE HEARD OPENING AND CLOSING as COUNT DOOKU strides into the room. He is above the Jedi, standing on a balcony, with two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. The Jedi turn to see him. He looks down on the Jedi.

OBI-WAN: (quietly to Anakin) This time we will do it together.

ANAKIN: I was about to say that.

COUNT DOOKU jumps down to the main level.

PALPATINE: Get help! You're no match for him. He's a Sith Lord.

OBI-WAN: Chancellor Palpatine, Sith Lords are our specialty.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN throw off their cloaks and ignite their lightsabers.

COUNT DOOKU: Your swords, please, Master Jedi. We don't want to make a mess of things in front of the Chancellor.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN move toward DOOKU.

OBI-WAN: You won't get away this time, Dooku.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN charge COUNT DOOKU. A great sword fight ensues.

COUNT DOOKU: I've been looking forward to this.

ANAKIN: My powers have doubled since the last time we met, Count.

COUNT DOOKU: Good. Twice the pride, double the fall.

DOOKU lunges at the JEDI and they fall back . . .

COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) Your moves are clumsy, Kenobi . . . too predictable. You'll have to do better.

As the battle proceeds, OBI-WAN and COUNT DOOKU are tired. ANAKIN is stronger as he becomes angry. ANAKIN continues to drive the attack on DOOKU. COUNT DOOKU throws OBI-WAN back using the Force.
ANAKIN and COUNT DOOKU move up the stairs. As they reach the upper landing of the General's Quarters, ANAKIN leaps over COUNT DOOKU. OBI-WAN reaches the top of the stairs, destroying TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS. COUNT DOOKU holds OBI-WAN in the air using the Force as he turns and kicks ANAKIN out of frame. OBI-WAN is choking.
ANAKIN hits the archway.
DOOKU sends OBI-WAN flying. The Jedi tumbles to the lower level unconscious. COUNT DOOKU spins around again and, using the Force, causes a section of the balcony to drop onto OBI-WAN. ANAKIN spins and kicks COUNT DOOKU, sending him over the balcony. ANAKIN Jumps, following him down to the main floor. COUNT DOOKU and ANAKIN continue the fight.

COUNT DOOKU: (continuing) I sense great fear in you, Skywalker. You have hate, you have anger, but you dont use them.

Anakin regains his composure and attacks COUNT DOOKU as the Dark Lord continues his spin to meet him head on. Their fighting becomes even more intense.
Anakin attacks COUNT DOOKU with a new ferociousness.

39 INT. GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Anakin and Dooku continue their fight. It is intense! Finally, in one last energized charge, ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's hands. The Jedi catches the lightsaber as it drops from the severed Sith Lord's hand. COUNT DOOKU stumbles to the floor as ANAKIN puts the two lightsabers to his neck. PALPATINE is grinning as he watches COUNT DOOKU's defeat.

PALPATINE: Good, Anakin, good. I knew you could do it. Kill him. Kill him now!

ANAKIN: I shouldn't . . .

PALPATINE: Do it!!

ANAKIN cuts off COUNT DOOKU's head. A huge EXPLOSION somewhere deep in the ship rattles everything.

ANAKIN: ... I couldn't stop myself.

PALPATINE: You did well, Anakin. He was too dangerous to be kept alive.

ANAKIN drops COUNT DOOKU's lightsaber, moving to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: Yes, but he was an unarmed prisoner.

ANAKIN raises his hands toward PALPATINE, who is strapped in the Admiral's Chair. The Chancellor's restraints pop loose.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I shouldn't have done that, Chancellor. It's not the Jedi way.

PALPATINE stands up, rubbing his wrists.

PALPATINE: It is only natural. He cut off your arm, and you wanted revenge. It wasn't the first time, Anakin. Remember what you told me about your mother and the Sand People. Now, we must leave before more security droids arrive.

The ship begins to list to one side. ANAKIN rushes over to OBI-WAN, lifts the control console from on top of him, and pulls him free. He kneels down and checks out his unconscious friend. PALPATINE heads for the elevators.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, there is no time. We must get off the ship before it's too late.

ANAKIN: He seems to be all right. No broken bones, breathing's all right.

PALPATINE: Leave him, or we'll never make it.

ANAKIN: His fate will be the same as ours.

ANAKIN picks up OBI-WAN, slings him over his shoulder, and heads for the elevators.

40 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare for attack.

PILOT: All batteries fire! Fire!

41 INT. BATTLESTATIONS-REPUBLIC CRUISER

Clone gunners fire on the Trade Federation cruiser and take fire in return. Gun emplacements are destroyed. Clone troopers go flying.

42 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN carries OBI-WAN to the elevator doors and hits the button. PALPATINE joins him.

ANAKIN: The elevator's not working, (into his comlink) Artoo . . .

ARTOO BEEPS a response to ANAKIN.

ANAKIN: (continuing) . . . Activate Elevator 3224.

Suddenly the ship shifts to its side as the elevator doors open. PALPATINE is thrown to the ground. ANAKIN jumps to the door frame of the elevator. ANAKIN looks into the elevator shaft.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Artoo ... do you copy? Artoo, come in!

43 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

Windows are blown out, droids and equipment are sucked into space.

PILOT: Reverse stabilizers.

44 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the ship rolls, spacecraft and equipment CRASH from one side of the ship to the other.
Several objects break through the metal blast doors, causing objects to be sucked into space. ARTOO starts to slide toward one of the small holes.

45 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the elevator shaft rotates, it has become a long hallway.
ANAKIN clings to the doorframe with OBI-WAN on his shoulder, as the Chancellor struggles to join him.

46 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO continues to skid and slide toward open space. He swerves around boxes and wrecked fighters. One of the BATTLE DROIDS stumbles and is consumed by the electronic shield in a zap. ARTOO BEEPS a reply as he dodges the laser blasts of the BATTLE DROIDS. One bolt hits very near him, and he SCREAMS in terror.

47 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

PILOT: Magnetize! Magnetize!

48 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ARTOO is about to be overtaken by a starfighter sliding behind him. He falls into a heap of broken battle droid parts and the fighter bounces over him.

49 EXT. SPACE-CORUSCANT

The TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER heads straight down toward the planet.

50 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-GENERAL'S QUARTERS-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN jumps into the horizontal elevator shaft with OBI-WAN still on his shoulder.

ANAKIN: We can't wait. Come on, we have to be fast.

PALPATINE climbs into the elevator shaft also. They start running. The ship begins to roll again, and the Jedi and the Chancellor are forced to jump from one side of the elevator to the other.

51 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Fire the emergency booster engines.

PILOT: Leveling out, sir.

52 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT ON SIDE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN still carrying OBI-WAN on his back, and PALPATINE run down the elevator shaft as it starts to move upright. ANAKIN cuts a control box on one of the doors, but before the doors can open, the ship moves to an angle, causing ANAKIN and PALPATINE to start sliding down the shaft. ANAKIN grabs some wires in the control box with one hand. PALPATINE grabs onto the Jedi's leg. As the ship rights itself, they are left hanging in the bottomless elevator shaft.

53 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT, VERTICAL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE hang precariously on the side of the bottomless elevator shaft. OBI-WAN regains consciousness and tries to look around.

ANAKIN: Easy. . . . We're in a bit of a situation.

OBI-WAN: Did I miss something?

OBI-WAN looks down and sees PALPATINE and the bottomless pit. They hear ARTOO BEEPING on Obi-Wan's comlink. The ship begins to roll, causing the vertical shaft to move into a forty-five-degree angle. They hear the elevator brakes release and look up to see the elevator heading toward them.

ANAKINN: Hold on.

OBI-WAN: What is that?

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN look up to watch the elevator approach them at high speed, then OBI-WAN turns to ANAKIN.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Oops.

ANAKIN: Artoo, Artoo, shut down the elevator!

OBI-WAN: Too late! Jump!

They fall about three hundred feet before the tilt of the ship catches up with them, and they hit the side of the shaft and slide at great speed just ahead of the elevator. The shaft continues to rotate until it is completely horizontal.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN take out and throw grappling hooks. The hooks catch and they continue to fall. All the doors in the elevator shaft open up, and the group swings through the open door into a hallway. The elevator roars by.

54 INT. ELEVATOR LOBBY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

ANAKIN, OBI-WAN, and PALPATINE fly through the elevator door and land.

OBI-WAN: Let's see if we can find something in the hangar bay that's still flyable. Come on.

ANAKIN: Artoo, get down here. Artoo, do you copy?

55 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

As the Federation Cruiser continues to rotate, ARTOO SQUEALS and pokes a periscope out of a pile of broken BATTLE DROID PARTS. He looks around then rockets up out of the debris.

56 INT. HALLWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lead PALPATINE down a hallway toward the hangar bay.

57 INT. DOORWAY TO HANGAR BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

It is extremely windy as bits and pieces are continually sucked into space. The hangar bay doors are closed, but great stresses are being exerted as the ship twists, re-entering the atmosphere of Coruscant. They stop in a doorway leading into the hangar bay.

OBI-WAN: None of those ships will get us anywhere.

ANAKIN: I agree.

PALPATINE: What are we going to do?

ANAKIN: I don't know.

OBI-WAN: Don't look at me. I don't know.

ANAKIN and PALPATINE both look to OBI-WAN. He shrugs his shoulders. Anakin's Fighter has been sucked out of the hangar bay and is totaled. Suddenly, the ship turns on its side.

ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on.

OBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod.

ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes.

58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them.

59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath.

ANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close.

They laugh.

60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

BODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields.

61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway.

ANAKIN: Ray shields!

OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment.

OBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this.

ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted.

OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault.

ANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero.

OBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here.

PALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release.

The Jedi look at each other in disbelief.

ANAKIN: I say . . . patience.

OBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it?

ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . .

ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself.

ANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem.

Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS.
ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over.

SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this.

OBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B?

62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue.

A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers.

OBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older.

ANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection.

OBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape.

ANAKIN: Artoo.

ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around.
OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer!

ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand.

The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS.

CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations.

OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge.
OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away.
ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor.
OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces.
ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

PILOT: Sir, we are falling out of orbit. All aft control cells are dead.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay on course . . . Don't bother with them. Keep the ship in orbit.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN destroy the remaining DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS retrieves one of the BODYGUARD'S staffs and faces OBI-WAN. ANAKIN leaps over a console and lands behind GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You lose, General Kenobi.

One of the PILOTS stands next to the General.

PILOT: The ship is breaking up!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: We've run out of time.

OBI-WAN tries to get at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. ANAKIN runs at the General from the opposing side. GENERAL GRIEVOUS turns and throws his electrified staff at the window. It breaks, causing chaos as everything that is not nailed down is sucked into space. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is the first one sucked out into space. He fires a cable from his arm that attaches to the ship. He swings in and lands firmly on the side of the ship.
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN, and PALPATINE hold on for dear life. A blast shield closes around where the window used to be.

63 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN continues to fight the BATTLE DROIDS. The DROIDS have backed him into a corner. OBI-WAN hides behind a control panel as the DROIDS blast away at him. He jumps up and over the DROIDS, cutting most of them down before he lands. He destroys the DROIDS and joins ANAKIN.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN cut through the rest of the DROIDS as if they were made of butter. PALPATINE stands in shock as he watches the carnage. Droid parts are firing everywhere. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN stand back to back and cut down the last of the DROIDS just as there is a huge shudder, followed by more alarms. SPARKS begin to fly outside the windows.

PALPATINE: The hull is burning up!

64 EXT. HULL-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS detaches his cable and crawls along the exterior hull of the Federation Cruiser, using his magnetized hands and feet. He reaches a row of escape pods and enters an airlock.

65 INT. POD BAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-SPACE

GENERAL GRIEVOUS enters the escape pod bay through the hatch. The Droid General goes to a control panel and opens an escape pod.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Time to abandon ship.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls a row of switches, and one by one the escape pods are jettisoned.

66 INT. ESCAPE POD-SPACE

He gets in one, the hatch closes, and the escape pod blasts away from the damaged Cruiser.

67 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN go over to the navigator's chair.

ANAKIN: All the escape pods have been launched.

OBI-WAN: Grievous. Can you fly a cruiser like this?

ANAKIN: You mean, do I know how to land what's left of this thing?

ANAKIN sits in the pilot's chair and sees on a screen the back half of the ship break away. There is a great jolt, and the ship tilts forward.

OBI-WAN: Well?

ANAKIN: Under the circumstances, I'd say the ability to pilot this thing is irrelevant. Strap yourselves in.

OBI-WAN and PALPATINE strap themselves into chairs. ANAKIN struggles with the controls of the ship. The ship starts to glow, and pieces break off. ARTOO moves in on Palpatine 's controls and assists in flying the cruiser.

OBI-WAN: Steady . . . Attitude . . . eighteen degrees.

ARTOO beeps.

ANAKIN: Pressure rising. We've got to slow this wreck down. Open all hatches, extend all flaps, and drag fins.

OBI-WAN: Temp steady. Hatches open, flaps extended, drag fins . . .

A large part of the ship breaks away.

ANAKIN: We lost something.

OBI-WAN: Not to worry, we're still flying half the ship.

ANAKIN: Now we're really picking up speed . . . I'm going to shift a few degrees and see if I can slow us down.

OBI-WAN: Careful . . . we're heating up-twelve thousand . . . thirteen thousand . . .

ANAKIN: What's our speed?

OBI-WAN: Eight plus sixty-forty. Eight plus sixty-twenty. Eight plus sixty. Temp ten thousand, nine thousand . . . we're in the atmosphere . . .

ANAKIN points to one of the controls. ARTOO beeps madly.

ANAKIN: Grab that . . . Keep us level.

OBI-WAN: Steady. Steady.

ANAKIN: Easy, Artoo. Hang on, this may get a little rough. We lost our heat shields.

OBI-WAN: Five thousand. Three thousand . . . two thousand. Fireships on the left and the right.

FlRESHIP PILOT: We'll take you in.

OBI-WAN: Copy that. Landing strip's straight ahead.

ANAKIN: We're coming in too hot.

OBI-WAN: Easy-easy.

The ship leaves a contrail as it streaks across the Coruscant skyline. PALPATINE and OBI-WAN hold on for dear life as the ship shakes and rattles toward an industrial landing platform.

68 EXT. CORUSCANT-INDUSTRIAL LANDING PLATFORM-AFTERNOON

A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing.

OBI-WAN: Another happy landing.

69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON

The small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle.

ANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master?

OBI-WAN: Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy.

ANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time.

OBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . .

ANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness.

OBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians.

ANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . .

OBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing.

ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN.
The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE.

MACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right?

PALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again.

MACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward.

PALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive.

MACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority.

BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway.

BAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough.

ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway.

ANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of.

ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd.

C-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that.

ARTOO beeps.

C-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself.

70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them.

BAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures.

ANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that.

Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure.

BAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate.

ANAKIN: Excuse me.

BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.

ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss.

PADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back.

ANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so.

PADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread.

ANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges.

ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back.

PADME: Wait, not here . . .

He grabs her again.

ANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married.

PADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . .

ANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you.

PADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later.

ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her.

ANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on?

PADME: I'm just excited to see you.

ANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it?

PADME: Nothing . . . nothing . . .

ANAKIN: You're frightened. (a little angry) Tell me what's going on!

PADME begins to cry.

PADME: You've been gone five months . . . it's been very hard for me. I've never felt so alone. There's . . .

ANAKIN: . . . Is there someone else?

PADME: (peeved, angry) No! Why do you think that? Your jealousy upsets me so much, Anakin. I do nothing to betray you, yet you still don't trust me. Nothing has changed.

ANAKIN: (sheepish) I'm afraid of losing you, Padme . . . that's all.

PADME: I will never stop loving you, Anakin. My only fear is losing you.

ANAKIN: It's just that I've never seen you like this . . .

PADME: Something wonderful has happened.

They look at each other for a long moment.

PADME: (continuing) I'm . . . Annie, I'm pregnant.

ANAKIN is stunned. He thinks through all of the ramifications of this. He takes her in his arms.

ANAKIN: That's . . . that's wonderful.

PADME: What are we going to do?

ANAKIN: We're not going to worry about anything right now, all right? This is a happy moment. The happiest moment of my life.

71 EXT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A small NEIMOIDIAN SHUTTLE lands. BATTLE DROIDS surround the ramp as GENERAL GRIEVOUS descends onto the platform. SUPER BATTLE DROID G21 approaches.

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: The planet is secure, sir. The population is under control.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Good. Where is the Separatist Council?

SUPER BATTLE DROID G21: This way, sir ...

GENERAL GRIEVOUS takes the elevator to an upper level. He enters a conference room and presses a series of buttons on the table, and bows.

72 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

A hologram of Darth Sidious appears.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Yes, Lord Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: General Grievous, I suggest you move the Separatist leaders to Mustafar.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SlDIOUS: The end of the war is near, General, and I promise you, victory is assured.

The hologram of Sidious talks to GRIEVOUS about the death of Count Dooku.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: But the loss of Count Dooku?

DARTH SlDIOUS: His death was a necessary loss, which will ensure our victory. Soon I will have a new apprentice . . . one far younger and more powerful than Lord Tyranus.

73 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-TWILIGHT

PADME stands in the balcony brushing her hair. ANAKIN leans against the wall, watching her lovingly.

ANAKIN: . . . every second I was thinking of you. Protecting the endless, nameless Outer Rim settlements became a torture . . . the battles were easy, the longing became unbearable . . . I've never been so happy as I am at this moment.

PADME: Annie, I want to have our baby back home on Naboo. We could go to the lake country where no one would know . . . where we would be safe. I could go early-and fix up the baby's room. I know the perfect spot, right by the gardens.

ANAKIN: You are so beautiful!

PADME: It's only because I'm so in love . . .

ANAKIN: No, it's because I'm so in love with you.

PADME: So love has blinded you?

ANAKIN: Well, that's not exactly what I meant . . .

PADME: But it's probably true!

They laugh.

ANAKIN: I haven't laughed in so long . . .

PADME: Neither have I.

74 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

The view is strangely distorted and disorienting. PADME is on a table in an alien medical chamber. She is giving birth and is screaming.

PADME: Anakin, help me! Help, Anakin! Anakin, I love you. I love you.

She screams and dies.

75 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-BEDROOM-NIGHT

ANAKIN awakens in a panic. He is covered in sweat. He looks over in the bed and sees PADME sound asleep next to him. ANAKIN gets out from under the sheets and sits on the side of the bed. He is breathing heavily. He puts his head in his hands and weeps. He regains his composure and leaves the room down a set of stairs. PADME awakens, realizes Anakin is gone.

PADME: Anakin??

She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him.

76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT

ANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught.
PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her.

PADME: What's bothering you?

ANAKIN: Nothing . . .

ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you.

PADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other?

ANAKIN: It was a dream.

PADME: Bad?

ANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died.

PADME: And?

ANAKIN: It was about you.

They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them.

PADME: Tell me.

ANAKIN: It was only a dream.

PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath.

ANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . .

PADME: And the baby?

ANAKIN: I don't know.

PADME: It was only a dream.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN: . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme.

They embrace, then part.

PADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order.

ANAKIN: I know .

PADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us?

ANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything?

PADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something.

ANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything!

PADME: I won't, Anakin.

ANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem.

77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY

YODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought.

YODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . .

ANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . .

YODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know?

ANAKIN: Someone . . .

YODA: . . . close to you?

ANAKIN: Yes.

YODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side.

ANAKIN: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda.

YODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is.

ANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda?

YODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose.

78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY

ANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting.

79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps.

OBI-WAN: You missed the report on the Outer Rim sieges.

ANAKIN: I'm sorry, I was held up. I have no excuse.

OBI-WAN: In short, they are going very well. Saleucami has fallen, and Master Vos has moved his troops to Boz Pity.

ANAKIN: What's wrong then?

OBI-WAN: The Senate is expected to vote more executive powers to the Chancellor today.

ANAKIN: Well, that can only mean less deliberating and more action. Is that bad? It will make it easier for us to end this war.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, be careful of your friend Palpatine.

ANAKIN: Be careful of what?

OBI-WAN: He has requested your presence.

ANAKIN: What for?

OBI-WAN: He would not say.

ANAKIN: He didn't inform the Jedi Council? That's unusual, isn't it?

OBI-WAN: All of this is unusual, and it's making me feel uneasy. You're probably aware that relations between the Council and the Chancellor are stressed.

ANAKIN: I know the Council has grown wary of the Chancellor's power, mine also for that matter. Aren't we all working together to save the Republic? Why all this distrust?

OBI-WAN: The Force grows dark, Anakin, and we are all affected by it. Be wary of your feelings.

80 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-DAY

ANAKIN stands with PALPATINE at his window overlooking the vastness of Coruscant. Several buildings have been destroyed. A brown haze hangs over the landscape.

PALPATINE: Anakin, this afternoon the Senate is going to call on me to take direct control of the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN: The Jedi will no longer report to the Senate?

PALPATINE: They will report to me . . . personally. The Senate is too unfocused to conduct a war. This will bring a quick end to things.

ANAKIN: I agree, but the Jedi Council may not see it that way.

PALPATINE: There are times when we must all endure adjustments to the constitution in the name of security.

ANAKIN: With all due respect, sir, the Council is in no mood for more constitutional amendments.

PALPATINE: Thank you, my friend, but in this case I have no choice . . . this war must be won.

ANAKIN: Everyone will agree on that.

PALPATINE: Anakin, I've known you since you were a small boy. I have advised you over the years when I could ... I am very proud of your accomplishments. You have won many battles the Jedi Council thought were lost . . . and you saved my life. I hope you trust me, Anakin.

ANAKIN: Of course.

PALPATINE: I need your help, son.

ANAKIN: What do you mean?

PALPATINE: I fear the Jedi. The Council keeps pushing for more control. They're shrouded in secrecy and obsessed with maintaining their autonomy . . . ideals. I find simply incomprehensible in a democracy.

ANAKIN: I can assure you that the Jedi are dedicated to the values of the Republic, sir.

PALPATINE: Nevertheless, their actions will speak more loudly than their words. I'm depending on you.

ANAKIN: For what? I don't understand.

PALPATINE: To be the eyes, ears, and voice of the Republic . . .

ANAKIN thinks about this.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin . . . I'm appointing you to be my personal representative on the Jedi Council.

ANAKIN: Me? A Master? I am overwhelmed, sir, but the Council elects its own members. They will never accept this.

PALPATINE: I think they will . . . they need you more than you know.

81 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S OFFICE-DAY

PADME, BAIL ORGANA, and SENATORS MON MOTHMA, FANG ZAR, TERR TANEEL, and GIDDEAN DANU sit in Senator Organa 's office.

BAIL ORGANA: Now that he has control of the Jedi Council, the Chancellor has appointed Governors to oversee all star systems in the Republic.

FANG ZAR: When did this happen?

BAIL ORGANA: The decree was posted this morning.

PADME: Do you think he will dismantle the Senate?

MON MOTHMA: Why bother? As a practical matter, the Senate no longer exists.

GIDDEAN DANU: The constitution is in shreds. Amendment after amendment . . . executive directives, sometimes a dozen in one day.

BAIL ORGANA: We can't let a thousand years of democracy disappear without a fight.

EVERYONE looks at each other, a little worried at the implications of what was just said.

TERR TANEEL: What are you suggesting?

BAIL ORGANA: I apologize. I didn't mean to sound like a Separatist.

MON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic.

BAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy.

PADME: I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen.

GlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate.

MON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it.

BAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . .

PADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid.

BAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing.

MON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told.

They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment.

PADME: Agreed.

82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens.

83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY

ANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI.

MACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative.

ANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order.

YODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine.

ANAKIN: I understand.

MACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master.

Anakin reacts with anger.

ANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master?

MACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker.

ANAKIN: Forgive me, Master.

ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous.

YODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep.

OBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare.

MACE: We cannot take ships from the front line.

OBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup.

YODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees?

MACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately!

OBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant.

ANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet.

MACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous.

YODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.

MACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all.

ANAKIN is disappointed.

84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious.

ANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting!

OBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs.

ANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . .

OBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off.

ANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation.

ANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties.

OBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it.

ANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve.

OBI-WAN: No, it is not. Anakin, I worry when you speak of jealousy and pride. Those are not Jedi thoughts. They're dangerous, dark thoughts.

ANAKIN: Master, you of all people should have confidence in my abilities. I know where my loyalties lie.

OBI-WAN: I hope so . . .

ANAKIN: I sense there's more to this talk than you're saying.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, the only reason the Council has approved your appointment is because the Chancellor trusts you.

ANAKIN: And?

OBI-WAN: Anakin, look, I am on your side. I didn't want to see you put in this situation.

ANAKIN: What situation?

OBI-WAN: (takes a deep breath) The Council wants you to report on all of the Chancellor's dealings. They want to know what he's up to.

ANAKIN: They want me to spy on the Chancellor? That's treason!

OBI-WAN: We are at war, Anakin. The Jedi Council is sworn to uphold the principles of the Republic, even if the Chancellor does not.

ANAKIN: Why didn't the Council give me this assignment when we were in session?

OBI-WAN: This assignment is not to be on record. The Council asked me to approach you on this personally.

ANAKIN: The Chancellor is not a bad man, Obi-Wan. He befriended me. He's watched out for me ever since I arrived here.

OBI-WAN: That is why you must help us, Anakin. Our allegiance is to the Senate, not to its leader who has managed to stay in office long after his term has expired.

ANAKIN: Master, the Senate demanded that he stay longer.

OBI-WAN: Yes, but use your feelings, Anakin. Something is out of place.

ANAKIN: You're asking me to do something against the Jedi Code. Against the Republic. Against a mentor . . . and a friend. That's what's out of place here. Why are you asking this of me?

OBI-WAN: The Council is asking you.

85 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

A JEDI GUNSHIP heads for the huge Clone landing platform.

86 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI GUNSHIP-DAY

YODA, MACE, and OBI-WAN ride in the GUNSHIP as it heads for the Clone landing platform. Mace and Obi-Wan are sitting.

OBI-WAN : Anakin did not take to his assignment with much enthusiasm.

YODA: Too much under the sway of the Chancellor, he is. Much anger there is in him. Too much pride in his powers.

MACE: It's very dangerous, putting them together. I don't think the boy can handle it. I don't trust him.

OBI-WAN: He'll be all right. I trust him with my life.

MACE:I wish I did.

OBI-WAN: With all due respect, Master, is he not the Chosen One? Is he not to destroy the Sith and bring balance to the Force?

MACE: So the prophecy says.

YODA: A prophecy . . . that misread could have been.

OBI-WAN: He will not let me down. He never has.

YODA: I hope right you are. And now destroy the Droid armies on Kashyyyk, I will. May the Force be with you.

The GUNSHIP lands and the ramp lowers. YODA exits the GUNSHIP. MACE and OBI-WAN stand and give him a brief bow then take off in the GUNSHIP.


PADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you.

ANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master.

PADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills.

ANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem.

PADME: Anakin . . .

ANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic.

PADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?

ANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean?

PADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy?

ANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist!

PADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume.

ANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy!

PADME: What is it?

ANAKIN: Nothing.

PADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you.

ANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you.

They look in each other's eyes.

ANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me.

PADME is startled at this.

PADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me.

PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed.

PADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war.

88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT

ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits.
ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House.
ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Mon Calamari Ballet doing "Squid Lake."

ANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor.

PALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system.

ANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war.

PALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far  but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing.

ANAKIN: They try.

PALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us.

ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will.

ANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand.

PALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me.

ANAKIN: I don't think . . .

PALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you?

ANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . .

PALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter.

ANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken.

PALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they?

ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down.

PALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they?

ANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say.

PALPATINE: Remember back to your early teachings. Anakin. "All those who gain power are afraid to lose it." Even the Jedi.

ANAKIN: The Jedi use their power for good.

PALPATINE: Good is a point of view, Anakin. And the Jedi point of view is not the only valid one. The Dark Lords of the Sith believe in security and justice also, yet they are considered by the Jedi to be. . .

ANAKIN: . . . evil.

PALPATINE: . . . from a Jedi's point of view. The Sith and the Jedi are similar in almost every way, including their quest for greater power. The difference between the two is the Sith are not afraid of the dark side of the Force. That is why they are more powerful.

ANAKIN: The Sith rely on their passion for their strength. They think inward, only about themselves.

PALPATINE: And the Jedi don't?

ANAKIN: The Jedi are selfless . . . they only care about others.

PALPATINE smiles.

PALPATINE: Or so you've been trained to believe. Why is it, then, that they have asked you to do something you feel is wrong?

ANAKIN: I'm not sure it's wrong.

PALPATINE: Have they asked you to betray the Jedi code? The Constitution? A friendship? Your own values? Think. Consider their motives. Keep your mind clear of assumptions. The fear of losing power is a weakness of both the Jedi and the Sith.

ANAKIN is deep in thought.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Did you ever hear the tragedy of Darth Plagueis "the wise"?

ANAKIN: No.

PALPATINE: I thought not. It's not a story the Jedi would tell you. It's a Sith legend. Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midi-chlorians to create life ... He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying.

ANAKIN: He could actually save people from death?

PALPATINE: The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural.

ANAKIN: What happened to him?

PALPATINE: He became so powerful . . . the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. (smiles) Plagueis never saw it coming. It's ironic he could save others from death, but not himself.

ANAKIN: Is it possible to learn this power?

PALPATINE: Not from a Jedi.

89 EXT. KASHYYYK-DAY

A WOOKIEE CATAMARAN flanked by WOOKIEE HELICOPTERS approaches the tree housing the HOLOGRAM AREA.

90 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA and various JEDI speak via hologram. The discussion includes OBI-WAN, MACE, AGEN KOLAR, YODA- KI-ADI-MUNDI and PLO KOON.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: (holo) Palpatine thinks General Grievous is on Utapau. We have had no reports of this from our agents.

MACE: (holo) How could the Chancellor have come by this information and we know nothing about it? We have had contact with Baron Papanoida and he said no one was there.

ANAKIN: A partial message was intercepted in a diplomatic packet from the Chairman of Utapau.

YODA: Act on this, we must. The capture of General Grievous will end this war. Quickly and decisively we should proceed.

OBI-WAN: Does everyone agree?

All the JEDI concur.

ANAKIN: The Chancellor has requested that I lead the campaign.

They all look at ANAKIN a bit disturbed.

MACE: (a little peeved) The Council will make up its own mind who is to go, not the Chancellor.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: Yes, this decision is ours to make.

ANAKIN is embarrassed and becomes sullen.

YODA: A Master is needed, with more experience.

MACE: Given our resources, I recommend we send only one Jedi . . . Master Kenobi.

ANAKIN: He was not so successful the last time he met Grievous.

OBI-WAN throws ANAKIN a dirty look.

ANAKIN: (continuing) No offense, my Master, but I'm only stating a fact.

OBI-WAN: Oh no, you're quite right, but I do have the most experience with his ways of combat.

YODA: Obi-Wan, my choice is.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: I concur. Master Kenobi should go.

YODA: I agree.

All the JEDI concur.

MACE: Very well. Council is adjourned.

ANAKIN is angry.

MACE: (continuing) Obi-Wan, prepare two clone brigades as quickly as you can. If this report is true, there's no telling how many battle droids he may have with him.

91 INT. KASHYYYK-HOLOGRAM AREA-DAY

YODA gets out of his chair and walks to the edge of the platform.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: The droids have started up their main power generators.

YODA: Then now the time is, Commander.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: Yes, sir.

The battle begins.

92 EXT. KASHYYYK-BEACH HEAD-DAY

A WOOKIEE CHIEFTAIN lets out a roar as the Wookiee army rushes to face the DROID ARMY. CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS race across the water against the WOOKIEES and CLONE TROOPERS on the beach. DROID GUNSHIPS provide air support, while a SPIDER DROID emerges from the watery depths. A brave WOOKIEE places an explosive on a SEPARATIST TANK and jumps off just before the TANK EXPLODES. From the Hologram Area, Yoda observes the ongoing battle.

93 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING

Padme's apartment building is surrounded by the smog-shrouded city of Coruscant.

94 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LIVING ROOM-EARLY MORNING

PADME and OBI-WAN sit on one of the couches.

OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been to see you?

PADME: Several times . . . I was so happy to hear he was accepted on the Jedi Council.

OBI-WAN: I know ... he deserves it. He is impatient, strong willed, very opinionated, but truly gifted.

They laugh.

PADME: You're not just here to say hello. Something is wrong, isn't it?

OBI-WAN: You should be a Jedi, Padme.

PADME: You're not very good at hiding your feelings.

OBI-WAN: It's Anakin . . . He's becoming moody and detached. He's been put in a difficult position as the Chancellor's representative . . . but I think it's more than that. I was hoping he may have talked to you.

PADME: Why would he talk to me about his work?

OBI-WAN studies her.

OBI-WAN: Neither of you is very good at hiding your feelings either.

PADME: Don't give me that look.

OBI-WAN: I know how he feels about you.

PADME: (nervous) What did he say?

OBI-WAN: Nothing. He didn't have to.

PADME is a little flustered. She stands and Obi-Wan follows. She walks to the balcony.

PADME: I don't know what you're talking about.

OBI-WAN: I know you both too well. I can see you two are in love. Padme, I'm worried about him.

PADME looks down and doesn't answer.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I fear your relationship has confused him. He's changed considerably since we returned . . .

They stand on the balcony and look off at the early morning city. OBI-WAN starts to leave. PADME stays looking off into the distant city.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Padme, I'm not telling the Council about any of this. I ... I hope I didn't upset you. We're all friends, I care about both of you . . .

PADME: Thank you, Obi-Wan.

OBI-WAN: Please do what you can to help him.

95 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-DAY

PADME, MON MOTHMA, and five other Senators (BANA BREEMU, FANG ZAR. CHI EEKWAY, GIDDEAN DANU, BAIL ORGANA) sit in Padme's living room. C-3PO serves drinks to the guests.

PADME: We cannot let this turn into another war.

BAIL ORGANA: Absolutely, that is the last thing we want.

MON MOTHMA: We are hoping to form an alliance in the Senate to stop the Chancellor from further subverting the constitution, that's all.

PADME: I know a Jedi I feel it would be wise to consult.

BANA BREEMU: That would be dangerous.

MON MOTHMA: We don't know where the Jedi stand in all this.

PADME: I only wish to discuss this with one . . . one I trust.

GiDDEAN DANU: Going against the Chancellor without the support of the Jedi is risky.

PADME: The Jedi aren't any happier with the situation than we are . . .

CHI EEKWAY: Patience, Senator.

FANG ZAR: We have so many Senators on our side, surely that will pursuade the Chancellor.

BANA BREEMU: When you present the "petition of the two thousand" to the Chancellor, things may change.

BAIL ORGANA: Let us see what we can accomplish in the Senate, before we include the Jedi.

PADME takes a deep breath in frustration and disappointment.

96 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk onto a landing platform overlooking a docking bay where THOUSANDS OF CLONE TROOPS and armored weapons, tanks, etc., are being loaded onto a massive REPUBLIC ASSAULT SHIP.

ANAKIN: You're going to need me on this one, Master.

OBI-WAN: Oh, I agree. However it may turn out just to be a wild bantha chase.

OBI-WAN starts to turn and leave.

ANAKIN: Master!

OBI-WAN stops and ANAKIN walks over to him.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Master, I've disappointed you. I have not been very appreciative of your training . . . I have been arrogant and I apologize . . . I've just been so frustrated with the Council. Your friendship means everything to me.

OBI-WAN: You are strong and wise, Anakin, and I am very proud of you. I have trained you since you were a small boy. I have taught you everything I know. And you have become a far greater Jedi than I could ever hope to be, and you have saved my life more times than I can remember. But be patient, Anakin. It won't be long before the Council makes you a Jedi Master.

OBI-WAN starts down the ramp, then turns back.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't worry. I have enough clones with me to take three systems the size of Utapau. I think I'll be able to handle the situation . . . even without your help.

ANAKIN: Well, there's always a first time.

OBI-WAN laughs.

They talk for a few more minutes before ANAKIN watches OBI-WAN depart.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan, may the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN: Good-bye, old friend. May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN heads down a ramp toward the waiting Republic cruiser.

97 EXT. CORUSCANT-CLONE LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The Republic cruiser lifts off and heads for space.

98 INT. REPUBLIC BATTLE CRUISER-HANGAR-SPACE

CLONE TROOPERS stand at attention in rows on the floor of the hangar deck, waiting to board landing craft. OBI-WAN stands next to his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER- talking to SEVERAL CLONE COMMANDERS with their helmets off. A hologram of the planet Utapau is projected by R4-G9 into the middle of the hangar.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Fortunately, most of the cities are concentrated on this small continent here . . . on the far side.

OBI-WAN: I'll keep them distracted until you get there. Just don't take too long.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Come on, boss, when have I ever let you down?

They laugh.

OBI-WAN: (laughing) Cato Nemoidia . . . for starters.

OBI-WAN climbs into his Jedi Fighter.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: That was Anakin who was late. I believe.

OBI-WAN: Very well, the burden is on me not to destroy all the droids before you get there.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: I'm counting on you.

99 EXT. JEDI FIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN blasts the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER out of the Republic Battle Cruiser and into the hyperspace ring. He heads for the planet Utapau.

100 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-CHANCELLOR'S TRANSPORT-DAY

The Chancellor's Transport races through the city and heads for the Senate Office Building landing platform. Waiting on the landing platform is a LONE JEDI. The Transport lands, and CHANCELLOR PALPATINE emerges with FOUR ROYAL GUARDS and MAS AMEDDA. The FOUR ROYAL GUARDS move off in another direction as PALPATINE greets ANAKIN, who has been waiting for him.

PALPATINE: Well, Anakin, did you see your friend off?

ANAKIN: He will soon have Grievous's head.

PALPATINE: We can only hope the Council didn't make a mistake.

ANAKIN: The Council was very sure in its decision.

They exit the landing platform.

101 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-DAY

They enter the main hallway of the Senate Office Building. They pass SEVERAL SENATORS, including REPRESENTATIVE JAR JAR BINKS from Naboo.

JAR JAR: Helloo Annie. Good en to see yousa . . .

The Gungan waves to Anakin.

ANAKIN: Hi, Jar Jar.

JAR JAR: Oopsin da Chancellor!! So sorry, Your Highness, sir.

Anakin turns back to the Chancellor.

PALPATINE: There are rumors in the Senate about Master Kenobi. Many believe he is not fit for this assignment.

ANAKIN: Not fit? Why would anyone think that?

PALPATINE: They say his mind has become fogged by the influence of a certain female Senator.

ANAKIN: That's ridiculous. Who?!?

PALPATINE: (slyly) No one knows who she is ... only that she is a Senator.

ANAKIN: That's impossible. I would know.

PALPATINE: Sometimes the closest are the ones who cannot see.

ANAKIN becomes worried.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Idle Senate gossip is rarely true and never accurate. I'm sure your Master will do fine.

102 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-DREAM

PADME calls out in pain. OBI-WAN is near her and softly speaks to her.

OBI-WAN: Save your energy.

PADME: I can't!

OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme. Don't give up . . .

103 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-LANDING ROOM-DAY

ANAKIN is in the living room, working. He sits on the couch where Obi-Wan was sitting. PADME enters and crosses behind him.

ANAKIN: I sense someone familiar . . . Obi-Wan's been here, hasn't he?

PADME: He came by this morning.

ANAKIN: What did he want?

PADME looks at him for a moment. ANAKIN seems tense.

PADME: He's worried about you.

ANAKIN: You told him about us, didn't you?

She continues to walk to the bedroom, he follows.

PADME: He's your best friend, Anakin. He says you're under a lot of stress.

ANAKIN: And he's not?

PADME: You have been moody lately.

ANAKIN: I'm not moody . . .

PADME: Anakin! Don't do this again.

ANAKIN: I don't know ... I feel . . . lost.

PADME: Lost? What do you mean? You're always so sure of yourself. I don't understand.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan and the Council don't trust me.

PADME: They trust you with their lives. Obi-Wan loves you as a son.

ANAKIN: Something's happening . . . I'm not the Jedi I should be. I am one of the most powerful Jedi, but I'm not satisfied ... I want more, and I know I shouldn't.

PADME: You expect too much of yourself.

They stop in front of the window in the bedroom. ANAKIN puts his hand on her belly.

ANAKIN: I have found a way to save you.

PADME: Save me?

ANAKIN: From my nightmares.

PADME: Is that what's bothering you?

ANAKIN: I won't lose you, Padme.

PADME: I'm not going to die in childbirth, Annie. I promise you.

ANAKIN: No, I promise you! I am becoming so powerful with my new knowledge of the Force, I will be able to keep you from dying.

PADME looks ANAKIN in the eye.

PADME: You don't need more power, Anakin. I believe you can protect me against anything, just as you are.

They embrace and kiss.

104 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN blasts out of the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER's hyperspace ring and heads for the planet Utapau. The BLUE FIGHTER skims over the planet's surface, flat except for a few giant sinkholes.

105 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN lands his ship on a Platform projecting out of the side of a giant sinkhole. All is quiet. A local administrator, TION MEDON, comes out to greet the ship. OBI-WAN climbs out of his Fighter as a SHORT GROUND CREW looks over his ship. On a ledge above the landing platform, GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS watch as OBI-WAN talks to TION MEDON.

TlON MEDON: Greetings, young Jedi. What brings you to our remote sanctuary?

OBI-WAN: Unfortunately, the war.

TlON MEDON: There is no war here unless you've brought it with you.

OBI-WAN: With your kind permission, I should like some fuel and to use your city as a base as I search nearby systems for General Grievous.

A GROUND CREW rushes out and refuels Obi-Wans Fighter. TION MEDON leans close to OBI-WAN and speaks quietly.

TlON MEDON: He is here! We are being held hostage. They are watching us.

OBI-WAN: I understand.

TlON MEDON: The tenth level . . . thousands of Battle Droids . . .

OBI-WAN: Tell your people to take shelter. If you have warriors, now is the time.

OBI-WAN starts back toward his Starfighter as TION MEDON leaves the Landing Platform. GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS retreat from the overhead platform. OBI-WAN climbs back into his BLUE JEDI FIGHTER. His Astro Unit (R4-G9) turns to him:

OBI-WAN: (continuing) Geenine, take the Fighter back to the ship. I'm staying here. Tell Cody I've made contact.

The little Astro Droid BEEPS a reply.

106 EXT. UTAPAU-OBSERVATION DECK-DAY

On a high balcony, TION MEDON looks down on the landing platform. A few steps behind him stands one of GENERAL GRIEVOUS's BODYGUARDS. They watch the canopy lower.

TlON MEDON: I told you, all he wanted was fuel.

BODYGUARD: What was his name?

TlON MEDON: He didn't say.

They watch as the BLUE JEDI FIGHTER takes off.

107 INT. UTAPAU-LANDING PLATFORM-HALLWAY-DAY

OBI-WAN also watches his ship take off. He is hiding in the hallway. He quietly moves farther into the city.

108 EXT. UTAPAU STAIRWAY-SINKHOLE RIM-DAY

OBI-WAN quickly rushes up a stairway cut into the side of the sinkhole. It's hard to see him. In an alcove, he carefully surveys the city, then quickly moves on.

109 INT. UTAPAU-CITY-DRAGON CORRAL-DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way through the city, looking up at the tenth level with electro-binoculars from his utility belt. He tries to figure out how he is going to get up there. He hears strange bellowing cries and he investigates.
He comes across a corral filled with about half a dozen DRAGON-LIKE LIZARDS. SEVERAL WRANGLERS are standing around.
OBI-WAN walks up to the WRANGLERS and uses the Force with his slight hand movements.

OBI-WAN: I need transportation.

WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) You need transportation.

OBI-WAN: Get it for me.

WRANGLER: (subtitled, in native tongue) I will get it for you.

One of the WRANGLERS turns to the others and chatters away in his strange tongue. OBI-WAN walks along the line of DRAGON/LIZARDS, checking out each one. He looks at their teeth, legs, etc. Finally he pats one on the neck.

OBI-WAN: This one.

The WRANGLER brings the chosen one over to him.

WRANGLER: Boga. She answers to Boga.

OBI-WAN: Good girl, Boga.

OBI-WAN swings onto the back of the LIZARD. The beast rears up and scurries outside to the edge of the sinkhole.

110 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LIZARD-DAY

The LIZARD BOGA rears up on her hind legs again, then climbs the wall of the sheer cliff and starts moving up toward the tenth level. The city appears to be deserted. OBI-WAN is alert to any movement.

111 INT. UTAPAU-CONFERENCE ROOM-GRAND CHAMBER-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS stands before the COUNCIL OF SEPARATISTS, including NUTE GUNRAY, RUNE HAAKO. POGGLE THE LESSER, SHU MAI, SAN HILL PO NUDO, WAT TAMBOR, and PASSEL ARGENTE. OBI-WAN hides above the assembly and watches intently.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: It won't be long before the armies of the Republic track us here. I am sending you to the Mustafar system in the Outer Rim. It is a volcanic planet which generates a great deal of scanning interference. You will be safe there.

NUTE GUNRAY: Safe? Chancellor Palpatine managed to escape your grip, General, without Count Dooku. I have doubts about your ability to keep us safe.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Be thankful, Viceroy, you have not found yourself in my grip . . . Your ship is waiting.

OBI-WAN is deep in thought.

112 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

The JEDI removes his cloak and jumps down behind the GENERAL.

OBI-WAN: Hello, there!

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: General Kenobi, you are a bold one. I find your behavior bewildering . . . Surely you realize you're doomed, (to droids) Kill him!

About a HUNDRED BATTLE DROIDS surround OBI-WAN, GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and his BODYGUARDS. OBI-WAN looks around, then walks right up to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.
They stare at each other for a moment.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Enough of this.

The BODYGUARDS raise their power staffs to knock OBI-WAN away, but OBI-WAN ducks as the deadly staffs whistle over his head. The Jedi's lightsaber ignites, and OBI-WAN deftly cuts one BODYGUARD in two. His staff flies into the air and is caught by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. The other THREE BODYGUARDS attack OBI-WAN with an intense fury.
OBI-WAN uses the Force to release apiece of equipment from the ceiling. It drops on the BODYGUARDS, smashing them. OBI-WAN walks toward GRIEVOUS, slashing the last BODYGUARD to pieces. BATTLE DROIDS move toward OBI-WAN.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Back away. I will deal with this Jedi slime myself.

OBI-WAN: Your move.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: You fool. I have been trained in your Jedi arts by Count Dooku himself. Attack, Kenobi.

His arms separate and grab all four lightsabers on his belt. His four arms create a flashing display of swordsmanship.

OBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku!

OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies.

OBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed.

OBI-WAN: I don't think so.

TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him.

113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY

More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS.
The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on.

114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga.

115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET

The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red.

116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET

PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate.

PADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution?

PALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . .

PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then.

PALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here.

FANGZAR: But surely . . .

The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR.

PALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee.

PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor.

PALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator.

PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN.

PALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us.

ANAKIN: What do you mean?

PALPATINE: They are not to be trusted.

ANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . .

PALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes.

ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken.

PALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things.

ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala.

PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look.

PALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin.

117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING

KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we
have begun our attack.

MACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his
intentions.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears.

MACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor.

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from
office.

MACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . .

Kl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption.

YODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take.

118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

ANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous.

PALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge.

ANAKIN: I should be there with him.

PALPATINE: It is upsetting to me to see that the Council doesn't seem to fully appreciate your talents. Don't you wonder why they won't make you a Jedi Master?

ANAKIN: I wish I knew. More and more I get the feeling that I am being excluded from the Council. I know there are things about the Force that they are not telling me.

PALPATINE: They don't trust you, Anakin. They see your future. They know your power will be too strong to control. Anakin, you must break through the fog of lies the Jedi have created around you. Let me help you to know the subtleties of the Force.

They walk into the hallway.

ANAKIN: How do you know the ways of the Force?

PALPATINE: My mentor taught me everything about the Force . . . even the nature of the dark side.

They stop.

ANAKIN: You know the dark side?!?

PALPATINE: Anakin, if one is to understand the great mystery, one must study all its aspects, not just the dogmatic, narrow view of the Jedi. If you wish to become a complete and wise leader, you must embrace a larger view of the Force. Be careful of the Jedi, Anakin. (pausing) They fear you. In time they will destroy you. Let me train you.

ANAKIN: I won't be a pawn in your political game. The Jedi are my family.

PALPATINE: Only through me can you achieve a power greater than any Jedi. Learn to know the dark side of the Force, Anakin, and you will be able to save your wife from certain death.

ANAKIN: What did you say?

PALPATINE: Use my knowledge, I beg you . . .

ANAKIN: You're a Sith Lord!

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.

PALPATINE: I know what has been troubling you . . . Listen to me. Don't continue to be a pawn of the Jedi Council! Ever since I've known you, you've been searching for a life greater than that of an ordinary Jedi . . . a life of significance, of conscience.

ANAKIN: You're wrong!

PALPATINE: Are you going to kill me?

ANAKIN: I would certainly like to.

PALPATINE: I know you would. I can feel your anger. It gives you focus, makes you stronger.

ANAKIN raises his lightsaber to PALPATINE's throat. There is a tense moment, then ANAKIN relaxes, and then turns off his lightsaber.

ANAKIN: I am going to turn you over to the Jedi Council.

PALPATINE: Of course you should. But you're not sure of their intentions, are you? What if I am right and they are plotting to take over the Republic?

ANAKIN: I will quickly discover the truth of all this.

PALPATINE: You have great wisdom, Anakin. Know the power of the dark side. The power to save Padme.

ANAKIN stares at him for a moment.
PALPATINE turns and moves to his office.

PALPATINE: (continuing) I am not going anywhere. You have time to decide my fate. Perhaps you'll reconsider and help me rule the galaxy for the good of all . . .

PALPATINE sits behind his desk.

119 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

OBI-WAN gives the LIZARD a swift kick with the heel of his boot, and they take off down the vertical side of the sheer cliff. As GENERAL GRIEVOUS reaches the landing platform where his shuttle is waiting. OBI-WAN drops onto the top of the starship with his LIZARD. GENERAL GRIEVOUS spins his scooter around and takes off up the vertical cliff face with OBI-WAN and his LIZARD in hot pursuit. The sinkhole is engulfed in a great battle between CLONES and DROIDS. The PEOPLE OF UTAPAU cower in whatever shelter they can find.

120 EXT. UTAPAU-MAIN CITY PLAZA-DAY

A LARGE GROUP OF UTAPAUAN TROOPS on LIZARDS attack the DROID ARMY.

OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race through the city at breakneck speed. Passing through battle zones, narrowly escaping EXPLOSIONS, laser bolts, and TROOPS from both sides.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS lays the Scooter down as he goes around sharp turns. Obi-Wan's LIZARD breathes hard as she tries to keep up. They destroy droids, equipment, and clone troops as the JEDI and the GENERAL cut a swath of destruction through the city.

121 EXT. UTAPAU-WINDMILLS-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS works his way out onto the rim of the sinkhole, passing some wind blades. The evil Droid General releases the brakes on the lethal blades, and they begin to spin, cutting off Obi-Wan's access to the General. Obi-Wan's LIZARD pulls up short in front of the blades. GENERAL GRIEVOUS laughs and talks into a comlink.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Prepare to move out of orbit. I will be up in a few moments.

OBI-WAN sizes up the situation, looking for a way to get to GENERAL GRIEVOUS.

The GENERAL accelerates off the edge, activating his claws, drops, and clings to another nearby grouping of windmills. Obi-Wan's LIZARD attempts to jump to follow and barely makes it, almost falling into the precipice below.

122 INT. UTAPAU-CITY TUNNEL SYSTEM-DAY

GENERAL GRIEVOUS roars through the stone block tunnel system, riding up on the curved walls as he goes around corners or passes oncoming traffic. OBI-WAN races after the Droid, his LIZARD moving onto the ceiling as they pass traffic. OBI-WAN catches up with GENERAL GRIEVOUS, and they charge through the tunnel, side by side. OBI-WAN grabs the Droid's electronic staff.

123 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

Extending from the wall of a small sinkhole is a secret landing platform with a small Federation Fighter sitting in the middle of it. OBI-WAN and GENERAL GRIEVOUS race out of the tunnel system and onto the landing platform.

OBI-WAN yanks on the staff, then jumps off his LIZARD onto the General's scooter, knocking both warriors to the ground. GENERAL GRIEVOUS pulls out a laser pistol and fires at OBI-WAN. The Jedi reaches out his hand, grabs the General's electro-staff and spins the staff, blocking the laser bolts.

OBI-WAN charges GENERAL GRIEVOUS, swinging the staff and hitting the Droid in the stomach, knocking the gun away. GENERAL GRIEVOUS is hit by the staff, and the Force bends his forearm. He pulls OBI-WAN close to him, and they engage in a furious fight. The electro-staff is knocked away. The two engage in hand-to-hand combat. OBI-WAN struggles to avoid the deadly blows of the brutal, unstoppable Droid.

GENERAL GRIEVOUS's stomachplate is loose. OBI-WAN grabs it and rips it off, revealing the alien life form's guts encased in a bag in the Droid's chest. GENERAL GRIEVOUS grabs OBI-WAN, hoists him over his head, and tosses him across the platform. OBI-WAN dangles off the edge of the platform. He clutches the rim, trying to hold on. The DROID then grabs the staff and charges OBI-WAN. At the last second, OBI-WAN reaches out his hand and uses the Force to retrieve the Droid's laser pistol.

The JEDI fires several blasts in the stomach area of the alien Droid, and he EXPLODES from the inside out. The smoldering Droid falls to the ground. OBI-WAN has killed GENERAL GRIEVOUS. He pulls himself up onto the platform and walks by the destroyed carcass.

OBI-WAN: So uncivilized . . .

OBI-WAN brushes himself off. He throws the pistol onto the platform, picks up the electro-staff, and jumps on BOGA. The trusty beast rears up and takes off into the tunnel system.

124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

MACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR's office. ANAKIN enters the hangar.

ANAKIN: Master Windu, I must talk to you.

MACE WiNDU: What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate.

ANAKIN: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord.

MACE WINDU: A Sith Lord?

ANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for.

MACE WiNDU: How do you know this?

ANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side.

MACE WiNDU: Are you sure?

ANAKIN: Absolutely.

MACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive.

ANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him.

MACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment.

ANAKIN: I must go, Master.

MACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

MACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return.

ANAKIN: Yes, Master.

ANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship.

125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING

(INTERCUT)

PADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME.

PALPATINE: (V.O.) You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost.

PADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know.

C-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right?

ANAKIN: I can't do this ... I can't let her die.

ANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off.

126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING

The sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform.
FOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across.

127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

The FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor's aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor's office.

128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORS OFFICE-EARLY EVENING

MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE.

PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected.

MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor.

MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers.

PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi?

MACE: The Senate will decide your fate.

PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate!

MACE: Not yet!

PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI.

PALPATINE: It's treason, then.

A close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight.

Jedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down.

ANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office.

In the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting.

They stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other.

MACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord.

PALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over.

MACE WlNDU: You old fool. The oppression of the Sith will never return. Your plot to regain control of the Republic is over . . . you have lost . . .

PALPATINE: No! No! You will die!

PALPATINE raises his hands, and lightning bolts shoot out. They are blocked by MACE's lightsaber. PALPATINE is pushed back against the window sill.

PALPATINE: He is a traitor, Anakin.

MACE WlNDU: He's the traitor. Stop him!

PALPATINE: Come to your senses, boy. The Jedi are in revolt. They will betray you, just as they betrayed me.

MACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .

PALPATINE: You are not one of them, Anakin. Don't let him kill me.

MACE WlNDU: Aarrrrggghhhhh . . .

PALPATINE: I am your pathway to power. I have the power to save the one you love. You must choose. You must stop him.

MACE WlNDU: Don't listen to him, Anakin.

PALPATINE: Help me! Don't let him kill me. I can't hold on any longer. Ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . . ahhhhhhh . . .

MACE pushes PALPATINE out to the edge of the ledge. As the Jedi moves closer, the bolts from Palpatine's hands begin to arch back on him. The Chancellor's face begins to twist and distort. His eyes become yellow as he struggles to intensify his powers.

PALPATINE: I can't ... I give up. Help me. I am weak ... I am too weak. Don't kill me. I give up. I'm dying. I can't hold on any longer.

MACE WlNDU: You Sith disease. I am going to end this once and for all.

ANAKIN: You can't kill him, Master. He must stand trial.

MACE WlNDU: He has too much control of the Senate and the Courts. He is too dangerous to be kept alive.

PALPATINE: I'm too weak. Don't kill me. Please.

ANAKIN: It is not the Jedi way . . .

MACE raises his sword to kill the CHANCELLOR.

ANAKIN: (continuing) He must live . . .

PALPATINE: Please don't, please don't . . .

ANAKIN: I need him . . .

PALPATINE: Please don't . . .

ANAKIN: NO!!!

Just as MACE is about to slash PALPATINE, ANAKIN steps in and cuts off the Jedi's hand holding the lightsaber.

As MACE stares at ANAKIN in shock, PALPATINE springs to life.
The full force of Palpatine's powerful Bolts blasts MACE. He attempts to deflect them with his one good hand, but the force is too great. As blue rays engulf his body, he is flung out the window and falls twenty stories to his death. No more screams. No more moans. PALPATINE lowers his arm.

PALPATINE: Power! Unlimited power!

His face has changed into a horrible mask of evil. ANAKIN looks on in horror. PALPATINE cackles.

ANAKIN: What have I done?

ANAKIN sits.

PALPATINE: You are fulfilling your destin, Anakin. Become my apprentice. Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

ANAKIN: I will do whatever you ask.

PALPATINE: Good.

ANAKIN: Just help me save Padme's life. I can't live without her. I won't let her die. I want the power to stop death.

PALPATINE: To cheat death is a power only one has achieved, but if we work together, I know we can discover the secret.

ANAKIN kneels before PALPATINE.

ANAKIN: I pledge myself to your teachings. To the ways of the Sith.

PALPATINE: Good. Good. The Force is strong with you. A powerful Sith you will become. Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth . . . Vader.

ANAKIN: Thank you. my Master.

PALPATINE: Rise, Darth Vader.

Palpatine moves over to his desk.

129 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL-DAY

YODA winces, closes his eyes, and holds his head. He feels a disturbance in the Force.

130 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EVENING

PALPATINE is putting on his dark cloak: he is now fully DARTH SIDIOUS.

PALPATINE: Because the Council did not trust you, my young apprentice, I believe you are the only Jedi with no knowledge of this plot. When the Jedi learn what has transpired here, they will kill us, along with all the Senators.

ANAKIN: I agree. The Jedi's next move will be against the Senate.

PALPATINE: Every single Jedi, including your friend Obi-Wan Kenobi, is now an enemy of the Republic. You understand that, don't you?

ANAKIN: I understand, Master.

PALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme.

ANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy?

PALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace.

131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT

ANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers.

132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY

The battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY.

OBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this.

He hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up.

OBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir!

OBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole.
The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord.

The HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper.

CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him!

The battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him.
OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole.

133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN

The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . .

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir.

DARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He's killed before he can defend himself.

134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY

A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush.

AAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . .

They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi.

AAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids?

BLY: No.

BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground.

DABTH SIDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six.

142 EXT. KASHYYYK-MEETING HALL BALCONY-DAY

A vista of waterways, high green mesas, and giant tree cities serves as a backdrop for the fierce battle, CLONES AND WOOKIEES against TRADE FEDERATION DROID ARMIES, with treaded tank-like vehicles. CLONE COMMANDER GREE holds his comlink.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE: It will be done, My Lord.

CLONE COMMANDER GREE snaps his comlink shut.

YODA watches from the balcony. The battle rages as CLONES and WOOKIEES attack DROIDS coming across the water on CORPORATE ALLIANCE TANK DROIDS. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL stand on either side of the Jedi Master as he watches the battle below. CLONE COMMANDER GREE and ONE OFFICER walk onto the balcony toward YODA. YODA stands looking over the battlefield below. When they are close enough, the CLONES reveal their weapons and fire.

But faster than the CLONES can reveal their weapons, YODA ignites his lightsaber, leaps in the air, and beheads both CLONES. CHEWBACCA and TARFFUL fire their weapons as more CLONES enter the hall. The Wookiees call out to YODA to follow them. CHEWBACCA picks YODA up and carries him away.

146 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

C-3PO and PADME look out the apartment window.

C-3PO: The Chancellor's office indicated Master Anakin returned to the Jedi Temple. Don't worry, My Lady. I am sure he will be all right.

PADME bursts into tears.

147 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN

The city planet is covered in a hazy glow. A column of black smoke can be seen rising in the distance. BAIL ORGANA's Speeder flies overhead, straight toward the smoke.

148 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LANDING PLATFORM-PRE-DAWN

The Jedi Temple is on fire. Large plumes of smoke billow toward the sky as BAIL ORGANA lands his Speeder on a Jedi Temple platform. FOUR CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance to the Temple. They lower their guns as BAIL gets out of his Speeder and walks toward them.

BAIL ORGANA: What's going on here?!?

CLONE SERGEANT: There's been a rebellion. Don't worry, sir, the situation is under control.

The CLONES bar the Senator from entering the Temple.

CLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) I'm sorry, sir. No one is allowed entry.

The CLONES point their guns at BAIL and cock them.

CLONE SERGEANT: (continuing) It's time for you to leave, sir.

BAIL ORGANA: And so it is.

BAIL reluctantly heads hack toward his Speeder. Suddenly, several SHOTS RING OUT. BAIL turns and sees a ten-year-old Jedi, ZETT JUKASSA, fighting the CLONES. Several more CLONES join in the fight, followed by CLONE COMMANDER APPO (1119), who points at BAIL.

CLONE COMMANDER APPO: Get him! Shoot him!

SEVERAL CLONES start firing at BAIL. The Senator jumps for cover behind his Speeder, starting the engines and pulling out his laser
pistol.

The YOUNG JEDI cuts down several CLONES, including APPO, before he is overrun and shot.

The Speeder takes off with BAIL clinging to the side. The CLONES fire at it as it disappears into the cityscape.

149 EXT. CORUSCANT-CITYSCAPE-PRE-DAWN

BAIL ORGANA struggles to pull himself into the Speeder as it races along through the cityscape. Finally, he climbs in, just as the Speeder is about to hit a building. BAIL steers clear of the building and races away.

150 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER SINKHOLE-DAY

The Jedi dives below the surface amid a barrage of laser fire. He dives deeper under the water, fumbling in his utility belt for a breathing device. He finds it and puts it in his mouth. He swims underwater until the CLONE TROOPS give up and stop filing.

151 EXT. UTAPAU-UNDERWATER CAVES-DAY

OBI-WAN removes the breathing apparatus after coming up from underwater. He starts to climb the rock wall.

OBI-WAN climbs the wall to the second cave just as TWO LITTLE SEEKER DRONES pop out of the water with their searchlights glowing. OBI-WAN presses himself against the wall of the smaller cave as the TWO SEEKER DRONES search the grotto. One of the SEEKERS begins to enter the cave in which OBI-WAN is hiding. OBI-WAN presses further into the wall. The light shines on the opposite wall and moves to the back of the cave, illuminating a huge NOS MONSTER. OBI-WAN holds his breath. The SEEKER is confused for a moment, then the NOS MONSTER lunges at the SMALL DROID and consumes it in one bite.

The NOS MONSTER'S lunge takes him past OBI-WAN, out of the cave, and into the water.

The SECOND SEEKER shines its light on the NOS MONSTER as the evil creature tries to grab the LITTLE DRONE. OBI-WAN slinks off toward the back of the cave. He comes upon a nest of BABY NOS MONSTERS. They SCREECH and make horrible sounds. OBI-WAN jumps over them and continues on his way through the tunnel system.

152 EXT. KASHYYYK-LAKE ON VILLAGE EDGE-DUSK

CLONES in modified one-man AT-ST's and Swamp Speeders flash their searchlights across the gloomy lake. The light of one of the AT-ST's spots something floating in the water. It is what's left of a Wookiee catamaran. The body of a dead Wookiee (TARFFUL) is lying across the stern of the wreckage of the flying boat. There is some movement on the boat. The CLONE SERGEANT on the AT-ST fires a warning shot past the boat.

AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there!

A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions.

CREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh)

CLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something?

CREATURE: It's nothing, nothing. (laughs)

CLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east.

CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.

Suddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS.

CREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be.

TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda.

YODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me.

YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on.

YODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . .

YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp.

153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK

The AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches.
The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod.

YODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have.

The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky.

154 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND STARSHIP LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

BAIL ORGANA walks out of a tunnel onto a huge underground platform with two of his AIDES. He is stopped by TWO ROYAL GUARDS.

ROYAL GUARD: Identification . . .

BAIL ORGANA: Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan.

BAIL and his AIDES hand them their ID cards. The ROYAL GUARDS check them over and give them back, then BAIL and his CREW walk on board his Starship.

155 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-UNDERGROUND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The platform rises to the surface of the Office Building. The ALDERAAN STARCRUISER takes off and disappears into the crisp morning sky.

156 INT ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS.

BAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon?

CAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command.

BAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe.

157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi?

CLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall.

He watches them pass.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship.

CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir.

OBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs.

158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous's secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky.

159 EXT. UTAPAU-SPACE

OBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous's tiny Starfighter.

160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S STARFIGHTER-SPACE

OBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink.

OBI-WAN: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . .

A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears.

BAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . .

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I've locked on. Repeat.

The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA.

BAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi??

OBI-WAN: Senator Organa! My Clone Troops turned on me ... I need help.

BAIL ORGANA: We have just rescued Master Yoda. It appears this ambush has happened everywhere. We're sending you our coordinates.

161 INT. CORUSCANT-PADMESAPARTMENT-PRE-DAWN

PADME stands before the window of her living room, watching the plume of smoke from the Jedi Temple. C-3PO enters from the bedroom.

C-3PO: My Lady, there's a Jedi fighter docking on the veranda.

PADME turns and rushes to the bedroom.

162 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-PRE-DAWN

THREEPIO walks out to ANAKIN's ship and talks with ARTOO. ARTOO beeps.

THREEPIO: Hush! Not so loud!

PADME rushes onto the veranda as ANAKIN exits his GREEN JEDI FIGHTER. They embrace.

PADME: Are you all right? I heard there was an attack on the Jedi Temple . . . you can see the smoke from here.

ANAKIN: I'm fine. I'm fine. I came to see if you and the baby are safe.

PADME: Captain Typho's here, we're safe. What's happening?

C-3PO continues to talk to R2-D2 on the GREEN FIGHTER.

C-3PO: What is going on?

ARTOO SQUEAKS and BEEPS.

C-3PO: (continuing) You can't be anymore confused than I am.

ANAKIN: The situation is not good. The Jedi have tried to overthrow the Republic . . .

PADME: I can't believe that!

ANAKIN: I couldn't either at first, but it's true. I saw Master Windu attempt to assassinate the Chancellor myself.

C-3PO leans over and whispers to ARTOO.

C-3PO: Something important is going on! I heard a rumor they are going to banish all droids.

ARTOO BEEPS rather loudly. C-3PO puts his fingers to his lips.

C-3PO: (continuing) Shhhhhh . . . not so loud.

ARTOO BEEPS quietly.

C-3PO: (continuing) Whatever it is, we'll be the last to know.

PADME: Anakin, what are you going to do?

ANAKIN looks down for a moment and then walks away from Padme.

ANAKIN: I will not betray the Republic . . . my loyalties lie with the Chancellor and with the Senate . . . and with you.

ANAKIN turns and walks back to Padme.

PADME: What about Obi-Wan?

ANAKIN: I don't know . . . Many Jedi have been killed. We can only hope that he's remained loyal to the Chancellor.

PADME: How could this have happened?

ANAKIN: The Republic is unstable, Padme. The Jedi aren't the only ones trying to take advantage of the situation. There are also traitors in the Senate.

PADME stands and reacts ever so slightly.

PADME: What are you saying?

ANAKIN: You need to distance yourself from your friends in the Senate. The Chancellor said they will be dealt with when this conflict is over.

PADME: What if they start an inquisition? I've opposed this war. What will you do if I become a suspect?

ANAKIN: That won't happen. I won't let it.

PADME: Oh, Anakin, I'm afraid.

ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms.

ANAKIN: Have faith, my love. Everything will soon be set right. The Chancellor has given me a very important mission. The Separatists have gathered in the Mustafar system. I'm going there to end this war. Wait for me until I return . . . things will be different, I promise.

They kiss.

ANAKIN: (continuing) Please, wait for me.

PADME: I will.

ANAKIN gets into his Fighter as THREEPIO backs away.

C-3PO: (to Artoo) Well, he is under a lot of stress, Artoo.

ARTOO beeps.

C-3PO: (continuing) Take care, my little friend.

ARTOO BEEPS a good-bye, and the fighter takes off. PADME is left alone on the veranda. She starts to cry. THREEPIO comes up to her.

C-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do?

PADME: No thank you, Threepio.

G-3PO: A snack, perhaps?

PADME: No.

THREEPIO starts to move off.

C-3PO: I feel so helpless.

163 EXT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-SPACE

OBI-WAN's ship docks with Bail Organa's Starcruiser.

164 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

The door to the main hallway slides open. OBI-WAN enters and is greeted by YODA and BAIL ORGANA. The three walk down the hallway.

BAIL ORGANA: You made it.

YODA: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is.

OBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also?

YODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did.

OBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive?

YODA: Heard from no one, have we.

BAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda.

OBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple?

YODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have.

BAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . .

OBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed.

BAIL ORGANA: It's too dangerous to return.

YODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you?

OBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened.

YODA: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way.

165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY

Workers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward.

166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

A HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS.

NUTE GUNRAY: The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord.

DARTH SIDIOUS: You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you.

The hologram disappears.

167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT

The Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit.

PILOT: We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir.

BAIL ORGANA: Send it through.

PILOT: Yes, sir.

The PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen.

MAS AMEDDA: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress.

BAIL ORGANA: Tell the Chancellor I will be there.

MAS AMEDDA: Very well. He will be expecting you.

MAS AMEDDA's image disappears from the screen.

BAIL ORGANA: It could be a trap.

OBI-WAN: No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact.

YODA: If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be.

168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY

OBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out.

GUARD: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance?

BAIL ORGANA: Certainly.

GUARD: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi.

OBI-WAN: It would be better if we stayed with the Senator.

GUARD: It would be better if they stayed with you.

BAIL and his AIDES go into the Senate. YODA and OBI-WAN head for the Jedi Temple.

169 EXT. MUSTAFAR-JEDI STARFIGHTER-SPACE

ANAKIN's Jedi Starfighter heads for the hazy blood-red planet of Mustafar.

170 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN flies over the volcanoes of Mustafar and lands his Jedi Starfighter on a complex of Landing Platforms. His cockpit opens as R2-D2 pops from the ship with a happy BEEP.

ANAKIN: Artoo . . . stay with the ship.

ARTOO lets out a sad little BEEP and moves back toward the ship.

171 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

ANAKIN, putting on his hood, walks across a walkway upon arriving on Mustafar.

172 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN appears in the doorway of the control center.

NUTE GUNRAY: Welcome, Lord Vader. We've been expecting you.

Everyone in the room looks to him as he raises his hand toward a control panel, and all the exits close. The confused SEPARATISTS look around in bewilderment.

173 EXT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-LATE DAY

Smoke from the smoldering shell of the Jedi Temple fills the air with a brown haze.

174 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MAIN ENTRANCE-LATE DAY

A DOZEN CLONE TROOPERS stand guard at the entrance of the Jedi Temple. Suddenly there is a flash of a lightsaber, a flurry of confusion, and all of the Clone Troopers are dead on the floor. YODA and OBI-WAN stand in the middle of the carnage.

OBI-WAN: There are several battalions of Clone Troopers on every level. Many are dressed as Jedi.

YODA: Dismantle the coded signal quickly. That group back there, soon discovered will be.

175 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE BUILDING-SUNSET

The awesome Senate Building looms over the city. The endless traffic continues to clutter the skyline.

176 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

The Chancellor is in the podium in the center of the vast arena giving a speech. MAS AMEDDA stands to the right of SIDIOUS. BAIL ORGANA walks through the hallway of the Main Senate Chamber. He enters the Senate Pod of Naboo and sits next to PADME. JAR JAR, CAPTAIN TYPHO and TWO HANDMAIDENS are in the pod also.

PALPATINE: . . . and the Jedi Rebellion has been foiled.

BAIL ORGANA: I was held up. What's happening?

PADME: The Chancellor has been elaborating on a plot by the Jedi, to overthrow the Senate.

BAIL ORGANA: That's not true!

PADME: He's been presenting evidence all afternoon.

BAIL ORGANA: And the Senate will go along with it, just like they always do.

PALPATINE: The remaining Jedi will be hunted down and defeated. (applause) Any collaborators will suffer the same fate.

(applause)

These have been trying times, but we have passed the test.

177 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-SUNSET

YODA and OBI-WAN make their way through the Temple, avoiding the HUNDREDS OF CLONE TROOPERS. They use the Force to distract the CLONES when they can.
YODA and OBI-WAN walk through the ruins of the Temple until they come across the bodies of some students.

OBI-WAN: Not even the younglings survived.

YODA: Killed not by clones, this Padawan. By a lightsaber, he was.

OBI-WAN: . . .Who?? Who could have done this?

178 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber, NUTE and the OTHERS panic. The DROIDS at the controls and the GUARDS grab their weapons, but it is too late. They are cut down in a flash. The Separatists bang on the doors, and NUTE and RUNE HAAKO flee under a table.

ANAKIN, stone-faced, moves through the room like the grim reaper. Bodies drop everywhere. SCREAMS are cut short as the head of the Banking Clan dies.

Then POGGLE THE LESSER loses his head; WAT TAMBOR, SHU MAI, and the REST OF THE SEPARATISTS run into the conference room.

179 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

PALPATINE: The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed, but I assure you my resolve has never been stronger.

Applause.

180 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

In the hallway, ANAKIN cuts down DROIDS and SEPARATISTS alike. He is unstoppable. ANAKIN turns his head-his eyes are yellow.

181 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-SUNSET

PALPATINE continues his speech at the podium.

PALPATINE:
"In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society."

There is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded.

PADME: 
"So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause."

182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY

After everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances.

RUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right!

RUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them.

183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY

NUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.

NUTE GUNRAY: The war is over. Lord Sidious promised us peace ... we only want . . .

NUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence.

184 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT

OBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center.

OBI-WAN: I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away.

YODA: Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry.

185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT

OBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area.

OBI-WAN: Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . .

YODA: If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find.

OBI-WAN: I must know the truth, Master.

OBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) It can't be . . . It can't be . . .

As ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him.

ANAKIN: The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing?

ANAKIN: Yes, My Master.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire.

OBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes.

OBI-WAN: I can't watch any more.

OBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments.

YODA: Destroy the Sith, we must.

OBI-WAN: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin.

YODA: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not.

OBI-WAN: He is like my brother ... I cannot do it.

YODA: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader.

OBI-WAN: How could it have come to this?

YODA: To question, no time there is.

OBI-WAN: I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look.

YODA: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you.

OBI-WAN: May the Force be with you, Master Yoda.

186 INT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-AFTERNOON

A DC0052 Intergalactic Speeder pulls up to the veranda landing of Padme's apartment.

187 EXT. CORUSCANT -PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-AFTERNOON

The cockpit of the sleek yellow Galactic Speeder opens, and a HOODED FIGURE emerges and walks onto the veranda. An ALARM GOES OFF deep in the apartment. The FIGURE stops before a security curtain that protects the veranda. C-3PO enters the veranda and approaches the FIGURE.

C-3PO: Hello, might I help you . . . Oh, it's you, Master Kenobi. Come in, quickly.

The security curtain disappears, and the FIGURE lifts his hood. It is OBI-WAN. The alarm stops sounding.

OBI-WAN: Has Anakin been here . . . ?

C-3PO: Yes . . . right after the attack on the Jedi Temple.

PADME comes down the stairs in a robe. THREEPIO leaves.

PADME: Master Kenobi . . .

She embraces Obi-Wan.

PADME: (continuing) Oh, Obi-Wan, thank goodness . . . you're alive.

OBI-WAN: The Republic has fallen. Padme . . . The Jedi Order is no more . . .

PADME: I know, it's hard to believe everything to which we've dedicated our lives is gone.

OBI-WAN: I believe we have been part of a plot hundreds of years in the making.

PADME: The Senate is still intact, there is some hope.

OBI-WAN: No. Padme . . . It's over . . . The Sith now rule the galaxy as they did before the Republic.

PADME: The Sith!?!

OBI-WAN: I'm here looking for Anakin . . . When was the last time you saw him?

PADME: Yesterday.

OBI-WAN: And do you know where he is now?

PADME: (looks down) No.

OBI-WAN: Padme, I need your help. He's in grave danger.

PADME: From the Sith?

OBI-WAN: From himself . . . Padme, Anakin has turned to the dark side.

PADME: You're wrong! How could you even say that?

OBI-WAN: I have seen a security hologram of him killing younglings.

PADME: Not Anakin! He couldn't!

OBI-WAN: He was deceived by a lie. We all were. It appears that the Chancellor is behind everything, including the war. Palpatine is the Sith Lord we've been looking for. After the death of Count Dooku, Anakin became his new apprentice.

PADME: I don't believe you ... I can't.

OBI-WAN: Padme, I must find him.

PADME: You're going to kill him, aren't you?

OBI-WAN: He has become a very great threat.

As PADME moves to sit down, she reveals her pregnancy.

PADME: I can't . . .

OBI-WAN: Anakin is the father, isn't he?

PADME looks away.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm so sorry.

OBI-WAN turns and leaves as PADME stares transfixed, not knowing what to do. She is worried and tormented. OBI-WAN takes off in the Speeder. She studies the japor snippet that is hanging around her neck.

188 INT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

R2-D2 waits forlornly for his Master in front of the Jedi Starfighter.

189 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN surveys the slaughter with a crazed look in his eyes.

190 INT. MUSTAFAR-CONTROL CENTER-BALCONY-DAY

ANAKIN stares out at Mustafar, standing on the control room balcony.

191 EXT. CORUSCANT-LANDING PLATFORM-SUNSET

A small Naboo Skiff rests on a landing platform in the vast congestion of Coruscant. PADME gets out of her Speeder, followed by CAPTAIN TYPHO and C-3PO.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: My Lady, let me come with you.

PADME: There is no danger. The fighting is over, and . . . this is personal.

TYPHO bows.

CAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree.

PADME: I'll be all right, Captain.

He goes to the speeder and gets in.

PADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me.

C-3PO: Oh, dear.

TYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off.

192 INT. NABOO SKIFF

THREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in.

C-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business.

OBI-WAN stows away on Padme's ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes.

193 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET

A HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena.

DARTH VADER: The Separatists are taken care of, My Master.

DARTH SlDIOUS: It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader.

DARTH VADER: Thank you, My Master.

194 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY

A Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately.

DARTH VADER: Very good, My Lord.

ANAKIN sees Padme's ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her.

195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

The sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin's GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him.

ANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . .

They embrace.

PADME: Oh, Anakin!

ANAKIN: It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here?

PADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things.

ANAKIN: What things?

PADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings.

ANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me.

PADME: He cares about us.

ANAKIN: Us??!

PADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you.

ANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough.

PADME: Anakin, all I want is your love.

ANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that.

PADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this.

ANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you.

PADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can.

ANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be.

PADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed.

ANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me.

PADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I
can't follow.

ANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan?

PADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you.

ANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar!

PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser.

PADME: No!

ANAKIN: You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me!

PADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ...

ANAKIN reaches out, and PADME grabs her throat as she starts to choke.

OBI-WAN: Let her go, Anakin.

ANAKIN: What have you and she been up to?

OBI-WAN: Let her go!

ANAKIN releases his grip on the unconscious PADME and she crumples to the ground.

ANAKIN: You turned her against me.

OBI-WAN: You have done that yourself.

ANAKIN: You will not take her from me.

ANAKIN throws off his cloak.

OBI-WAN: Your anger and your lust for power have already done that.

OBI-WAN flings off his cloak.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) You have allowed this Dark Lord to twist your mind until now . . . until now you have become the very thing you swore to destroy.

They circle each other until OBI-WAN is near PADME. He places his hand on her.

ANAKIN: Don't lecture me, Obi-Wan. I see through the lies of the Jedi. I do not fear the dark side as you do. I have brought peace, justice, freedom, and security to my new Empire.

OBI-WAN: Your new Empire?

ANAKIN: Don't make me kill you.

OBI-WAN: Anakin, my allegiance is to the Republic ... to democracy.

ANAKIN: If you're not with me, you're my enemy.

OBI-WAN: Only a Sith Lord deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.

(ignites his lightsaber)

ANAKIN: You will try.

ANAKIN ignites his lightsaber.

ANAKIN lashes out at OBI-WAN, and they begin a ferocious sword fight. ANAKIN throws CONTAINERS at OBI-WAN using the Force.
They work their way off the landing platform and into the main entry hallway. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN, and OBI-WAN drops to a lower level.
ARTOO BEEPS his concern and rushes to the unconscious PADME's aid.

196 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT

YODA enters, using the Force to throw two RED GUARDS against the wall, knocking them unconscious. DARTH SIDIOUS turns his chair toward YODA. MAS AMEDDA stands behind SIDIOUS's desk.

YODA: I hear a new apprentice, you have. Emperor, or should I call you Darth Sidious.

DARTH SlDIOUS: Master Yoda, you survived.

YODA: Surprised?

DARTH SlDIOUS: Your arrogance blinds you, Master Yoda. Now you will experience the full power of the dark side.

The Dark Lord raises his arms, and LIGHTNING BOLTS shoot out, surrounding YODA.
YODA is picked up and thrown across the room, hitting the wall and sliding down in a crumpled heap. DARTH SIDIOUS chuckles.

197 INT. MUSTAFAR-PASSAGES TO MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN move their fight toward the main control center. As the laser swords fly, bits of the hallway are cut up. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump and use every trick in the Jedi book.

198 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO CRUISER-DAY

C-3PO starts down the ramp.

199 INT. CORRIDOR-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-NIGHT

MAS AMEDDA leaves the room. PALPATINE approaches a stunned YODA.

DARTH SlDIOUS: I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend. At last, the Jedi are no more.

YODA: Not if anything I have to say about it, Lord Sidious.

YODA uses the Force to throw DARTH SIDIOUS back, knocking him clear over his desk and onto the floor in a heap.

YODA: (continuing) At an end your rule is and not short enough it was, I must say.

DARTH SIDIOUS flies through the air, cape flapping, heading toward the exit. At the last second, YODA flies into the exit and stops the Dark Lord.

YODA: (continuing) If so powerful you are, why leave??

YODA ignites his lightsaber.

DARTH SlDIOUS: You will not stop me. Darth Vader will become more powerful than either of us.

DARTH SIDIOUS ignites his lightsaber.

YODA: Faith in your new apprentice, misplaced may be, as is your faith in the dark side of the Force.

Their swords CLASH. The battle is extremely fast and furious.


200 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY

View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room.

ANAKIN: Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side.

OBI-WAN: I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you.

ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKINs lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same.

The battle intensifies.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance.

OBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment.

ANAKIN: You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN.
Both combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels.
They regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN away.

203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

YODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord's lightning bolts.

The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed.

YODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy.

YODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another.

YODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment.

YODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA.

The balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava.

ANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel.
ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN.

They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant.

208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT

A Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda 's body.

CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: There is no sign of his body, sir.

MAS AMEDDA: Then he is not dead.

PALPATINE: Double your search.

CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: Yes sir. Right away, sir.

PALPATINE: (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff.

MAS AMEDDA: Yes, Master.

PALPATINE: I sense Lord Vader is in danger.

PALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods.

209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover.
Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river.

It bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava.

210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT

BAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights.

YODA: Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.

YODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city.

212 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

OBI-WAN realizes he is getting very close to the edge of the lava falls. He grabs a rope and leaps from the collection arm. ANAKIN follows.
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN continue their sword fight hanging from cables as they swing past each other.

214 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY

From their cables, ANAKIN and OBI-WAN both spot something that causes them to stop fighting. The lava river ahead drops off in a tremendous lava fall.

SNAPPING AND METAL GROANS are heard as the main part of the collector starts to break away and move toward the lava fall. OBI-WAN looks around and sees a small floating platform making its way toward the tower.

OBI-WAN does a double hack-flip and lands squarely on the floating platform. He immediately leans to one side and moves away from the tower.

ANAKIN realizes he is doomed as the entire tower heads for the falls. In the distance he sees some CONSTRUCTION DROIDS. He swings back to the tower, climbs up and makes a running leap and miraculously lands on A WORKER DROID. The DROID is confused and chatters to his CO-WORKER. The giant collector goes over the lava flow and disappears in the mist of sparks below.

OBI-WAN heads for the bank of the lava river, but Anakin's DROID is faster. He catches up with his old Master.

OBI-WAN and ANAKIN continue the swordfight. They battle away, balancing on the tiny platform and puzzled DROID. ANAKIN, standing on the Droid, approaches OBI-WAN on the work platform.

OBI-WAN: I have failed you, Anakin. I was never able to teach you to think.

ANAKIN and OBI-WAN confront each other on the lava river.

ANAKIN: I should have known the Jedi were plotting to take over . . .

OBI-WAN: 
"From the Sith!!! Anakin, Chancellor Palpatine is evil."

ANAKIN: 
"From the Jedi point of view! From my point of view, the Jedi are evil."

OBI-WAN: 
"Well, then you are lost!"

ANAKIN: 
"This is the end for you, My Master."

ANAKIN jumps and flips onto OBI- WAN's platform. The fighting continues again until OBI-WAN jumps toward the safety of the black sandy edge of the lava river. He yells at Anakin.

OBI-WAN: 
"It's over, Anakin. I have the high ground."

ANAKIN: 
"You underestimate my power!"

OBI-WAN: 
"Don't try it."

ANAKIN follows, and OBI-WAN cuts his young apprentice at the knees, then cuts off his left arm in the blink of an eye. ANAKIN tumbles down the embankment and rolls to a stop near the edge of the lava.

ANAKIN struggles to pull himself up the embankment with his mechanical hand. His thin leather glove has been burned off. He keeps sliding down in the black sand.

OBI-WAN: (continuing) . . . You were the Chosen One! It was said that you would, destroy the Sith, not join them. It was you who would bring balance to the Force, not leave it in Darkness.

OBI-WAN picks up Anakin's light saber and begins to walk away. He stops and looks back.

ANAKIN: I hate you!

OBI-WAN: You were my brother, Anakin. I loved you.

ANAKIN'S clothing blows into the lava river and ignites. Suddenly ANAKIN bursts into flames and starts SCREAMING.

215 INT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

OBI-WAN looks in horror as ANAKIN becomes engulfed in flames. OBI-WAN can't watch him as he struggles to climb the embankment, covered in flames.

He runs back to Padme's ship as ANAKIN drops, smoldering, near the top of the lava pit.

216 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

OBI-WAN makes his way to the SKIFF. He looks for Padme. THREEPIO sticks his head out the door of the SKIFF.

C-3PO: Master Kenobi! We have Miss Padme on board. Please, please hurry. We should leave this dreadful place.

OBI-WAN runs on board the Naboo Skiff.

217 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-NABOO SKIFF-DAY

PADME lies on a cot or bed inside the ship. OBI-WAN walks over and checks on her.

PADME: Obi-Wan? Is Anakin all right?

OBI-WAN looks at her sadly and does not answer. He brushes her hair back. Padme drops back into unconsciousness. ARTOO watches over her.
OBI-WAN rides in the co-pilot's station. He sits looking pensive. THREEPIO drives.

218 EXT. MUSTAFAR-VOLCANO EDGE-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS discovers what remains of ANAKIN and checks him out. He turns to the CLONES.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately.

CLONE CAPTAIN: Yes sir. Right away.

Several of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN's forehead.

222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT

On the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates.

YODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ...

QUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith.

YODA: Eternal consciousness.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed.

YODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is.

QUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self.

YODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become.

YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation.

BAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact.

223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY

POLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting.

MEDICAL DROID: Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her.

OBI-WAN: She's dying?

MEDICAL DROID: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies.

BAIL ORGANA: Babies??!!

MEDICAL DROID: She's carrying twins.

YODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope.

The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS.

C-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think.

227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

The TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand.

OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme.

PADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY.

MEDICAL DROID: It's a boy.

PADME: Luke . . .

PADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead.

MEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl.

PADME: . . . Leia.

R2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space.

OBI-WAN: You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on.

PADME: I can't . . .

PADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN's hand. She is holding Anakin's japor snippet.

OBI-WAN: Save your energy.

PADME: Obi-Wan . . . there . . . is good in him. I know there is ... still . . .

A last gasp, and she dies. Obi-Wan studies the necklace.

231 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY

DARTH SIDIOUS hovers around the periphery of a group of MEDICAL DROIDS who are working on ANAKIN. DARTH SIDIOUS paces in the foreground. A DROID approaches the Dark Lord.

MEDICAL DROID: My Lord, the construction is finished ... he lives.

DARTH SIDIOUS: Good. Good.

The DROID moves back to the table where DARTH VADER lies. The table begins to move upright. DARTH SIDIOUS moves in next to DARTH VADER.

DARTH SIDIOUS: (continuing) Lord Vader, can you hear me?

DARTH VADER, with his dark mask and helmet, moves up into the frame until he is in a CLOSEUP.

DARTH VADER: Yes, My Master.

DARTH VADER looks around the room.

DARTH VADER: (continuing) Where is Padme? Is she safe, is she all right?

DARTH SIDIOUS moves closer to the half droid/half man.

DARTH SIDIOUS: I'm afraid she died. ... it seems in your anger, you killed her.

A LOW GROAN emanates from Vader's mask. Suddenly everything in the room begins to implode, including some of the DROIDS.

DARTH VADER: I couldn't have! She was alive! I felt her! She was alive! It's impossible! No!!!

VADER SCREAMS, breaks his bonds to the table, and steps forward, waving his hands, causing objects to fly around the room. SIDIOUS deflects the objects, but some of the DROIDS aren't so lucky. VADER'S PAINFUL SCREAMS echo throughout the Center.

YODA: Split up, they should be.

BAIL ORGANA: My wife and I will take the girl. We've always talked of adopting a baby girl. She will be loved with us.

OBI-WAN: And what of the boy?

YODA: To Tatooine. To his family, send him.

OBI-WAN: I will take the child and watch over him. Master Yoda, do you think Anakin's twins will be able to defeat Darth Sidious?

YODA: Strong the Force runs, in the Skywalker line. Hope, we can . . . Done, it is. Until the time is right, disappear we will.

BAIL leaves the conference room. YODA stops OBI-WAN.

YODA: (continuing) Master Kenobi, wait a moment. In your solitude on Tatooine, training I have for you.

OBI-WAN: Training??

YODA: An old friend has learned the path to immortality.

OBI-WAN: Who?

YODA: One who has returned from the netherworld of the Force to train me . . . your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.

OBI-WAN: Qui-Gon? But, how could he accomplish this?

YODA: The secret of the Ancient Order of the Whills, he studied. How to commune with him. I will teach you.

OBI-WAN: I will be able to talk with him?

YODA: How to join the Force, he will train you. Your consciousness you will retain, when one with the Force. Even your physical self, perhaps.

OBI-WAN leaves as OWEN, BERU, and the BABY watch the twin suns set.

                             ----------------------


A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...


        A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the main
        title. War drums echo through the heavens as a rollup 
        slowly crawls into infinity.


          It is a period of civil war.
          Rebel spaceships, striking
          from a hidden base, have won
          their first victory against
          the evil Galactic Empire.

          During the battle, Rebel
          spies managed to steal secret
          plans to the Empire's
          ultimate weapon, the DEATH
          STAR, an armored space
          station with enough power
          to destroy an entire planet.

          Pursued by the Empire's
          sinister agents, Princess
          Leia races home aboard her
          starship, custodian of the
          stolen plans that can save her
          people and restore
          freedom to the galaxy....


        The awesome yellow planet of Tatooine emerges from a total
        eclipse, her two moons glowing against the darkness. A tiny
        silver spacecraft, a Rebel Blockade Runner firing lasers from
        the back of the ship, races through space. It is pursed by a
        giant Imperial Stardestroyer. Hundreds of deadly laserbolts
        streak from the Imperial Stardestroyer, causing the main solar
        fin of the Rebel craft to disintegrate.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- MAIN PASSAGEWAY.

        An explosion rocks the ship as two robots, Artoo-Detoo (R2-D2)
        and See-Threepio (C-3PO) struggle to make their way through the
        shaking, bouncing passageway. Both robots are old and battered. 
        Artoo is a short, claw-armed tripod. His face is a mass of
        computer lights surrounding a radar eye. Threepio, on the
        other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. He
        has a gleaming bronze-like metallic surface of an Art Deco
        design. 
           Another blast shakes them as they struggle along their
        way.

THREEPIO: Did you hear that? They've shut down the main reactor. We'll
be destroyed for sure. This is madness!

           Rebel troopers rush past the robots and take up positions
        in the main passageway. They aim their weapons toward the door.

THREEPIO: We're doomed!

           The little R2 unit makes a series of electronic sounds that
        only another robot could understand.

THREEPIO: There'll be no escape for the Princess this time.

           Artoo continues making beeping sounds. Tension mounts as
        loud metallic latches clank and the scream of heavy equipment
        are heard moving around the outside hull of the ship.

THREEPIO: What's that?

EXTERIOR: SPACECRAFT IN SPACE.

        The Imperial craft has easily overtaken the Rebel Blockade
        Runner. The smaller Rebel ship is being drawn into the
        underside dock of the giant Imperial starship.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.

        The nervous Rebel troopers aim their weapons. Suddenly a
        tremendous blast opens up a hole in the main passageway and a
        score of fearsome armored spacesuited stormtroopers make their
        way into the smoke-filled corridor.
           In a few minutes the entire passageway is ablaze with
        laserfire. The deadly bolts ricochet in wild random patterns
        creating huge explosions. Stormtroopers scatter and duck
        behind storage lockers. Laserbolts hit several Rebel soldiers
        who scream and stagger through the smoke, holding shattered
        arms and faces.
           An explosion hits near the robots.

THREEPIO: I should have known better than to trust the logic of a
half-sized thermocapsulary dehousing assister...

           Artoo counters with an angry rebuttal as the battle rages
        around the two hapless robots.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT WASTELAND -- DAY.

        A death-white wasteland stretches from horizon to horizon. The
        tremendous heat of two huge twin suns settle on a lone figure,
        Luke Skywalker, a farm boy with heroic aspirations who looks
        much younger than his eighteen years. His shaggy hair and
        baggy tunic give him the air of a simple but lovable lad with
        a prize-winning smile.
           A light wind whips at him as he adjusts several valves on a
        large battered moisture vaporator which sticks out of the
        desert floor much like an oil pipe with valves. He is aided by
        a beatup tread-robot with six claw arms. The little robot
        appears to be barely functioning and moves with jerky motions.
        A bright sparkle in the morning sky catches Luke's eye and he
        instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility
        belt. He stands transfixed for a few moments studying the
        heavens, then dashed toward his dented, crudely repaired
        Landspeeder (an auto-like transport that travels a few feet
        above the ground on a magnetic-field). He motions for the tiny
        robot to follow him.

LUKE: Hurry up! Come with me! What are you waiting for?! Get in gear!

           The robot scoots around in a tight circle, stops short, and
        smoke begins to pour out of every joint. Luke throws his arms
        up in disgust. Exasperated, the young farm boy jumps into his
        Landspeeder leaving the smoldering robot to hum madly.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- MAIN HALLWAY.

        The awesome, seven-foot-tall Dark Lord of the Sith makes his
        way into the blinding light of the main passageway. This is
        Darth Vader, right hand of the Emperor. His face is obscured
        by his flowing black robes and grotesque breath mask, which
        stands out next to the fascist white armored suits of the
        Imperial stormtroopers. Everyone instinctively backs away from
        the imposing warrior and a deathly quiet sweeps through the
        Rebel troops. Several of the Rebel troops break and run in a
        frenzied panic.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.

        A woman's hand puts a card into an opening in Artoo's dome.
        Artoo makes beeping sounds.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER.

        Threepio stands in a hallway, somewhat bewildered. Artoo is
        nowhere in sight. The pitiful screams of the doomed Rebel
        soldiers can be heard in the distance.

THREEPIO: Artoo! Artoo-Detoo, where are you?

           A familiar clanking sound attacks Threepio's attention and
        he spots little Artoo at the end of the hallway in a
        smoke-filled alcove. A beautiful young girl (about sixteen
        years old) stands in front of Artoo. Surreal and out of place,
        dreamlike and half hidden in the smoke, she finishes adjusting
        something on Artoo's computer face, then watches as the little
        robot joins his companion.

THREEPIO: At last! Where have you been?

        Stormtroopers can be heard battling in the distance.

THREEPIO: They're heading in this direction. What are we going to do?
We'll be sent to the spice mine of Kessel or smashed into who knows
what!

           Artoo scoots past his bronze friend and races down the
        subhallway. Threepio chases after him.

THREEPIO: Wait a minute, where are you going?

           Artoo responds with electronic beeps.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- CORRIDOR

        The evil Darth Vader stands amid the broken and twisted bodies
        of his foes. He grabs a wounded Rebel Officer by the neck as
        an Imperial Officer rushes up to the Dark Lord.

IMPERIAL OFFICER: The Death Star plans are not in the main computer.

           Vader squeezes the neck of the Rebel Officer, who struggles
        in vain.

VADER: Where are those transmissions you intercepted?

           Vader lifts the Rebel off his feet by his throat.

VADER: What have you done with those plans?

REBEL OFFICER: We intercepted no transmissions. Aaah....This is a
consular ship. Were on a diplomatic mission.

VADER: If this is a consular ship...were is the Ambassador?

           The Rebel refuses to speak but eventually cries out as the
        Dark Lord begins to squeeze the officer's throat, creating a
        gruesome snapping and choking, until the soldier goes limp.
        Vader tosses the dead soldier against the wall and turns to
        his troops.

VADER: Commander, tear this ship apart until you've found those plans
and bring me the Ambassador. I want her alive!

           The stormtroopers scurry into the subhallways.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- SUBHALLWAY.

        The lovely young girl huddles in a small alcove as the
        stormtroopers search through the ship. She is Princess Leia
        Organa, a member of the Alderaan Senate. The fear in her eyes
        slowly gives way to anger as the muted crushing sounds of the
        approaching stormtroopers grow louder. One of the troopers
        spots her.

TROOPER: There she is! Set for stun!

           Leia steps from her hiding place and blasts a trooper with
        her laser pistol. She starts to run but is felled by a
        paralyzing ray. The troopers inspect her inert body.

TROOPER: She'll be all right. Inform Lord Vader we have a prisoner.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- SUBHALLWAY.

        Artoo stops before the small hatch of an emergency lifepod. He
        snaps the seal on the main latch and a red warning light
        begins to flash. The stubby astro-robot works his way into the
        cramped four-man pod.

THREEPIO: Hey, you're not permitted in there. It's restricted. You'll
be deactivated for sure..

           Artoo beeps something to him.

THREEPIO: Don't call me a mindless philosopher, you overweight glob of
grease! Now come out before somebody sees you.

           Artoo whistles something at his reluctant friend regarding
        the mission he is about to perform.

THREEPIO: Secret mission? What plans? What are you talking about? I'm
not getting in there!

           Artoo isn't happy with Threepio's stubbornness, and he beeps
        and twangs angrily.

        A new explosion, this time very close, sends dust and debris
        through the narrow subhallway. Flames lick at Threepio and,
        after a flurry of electronic swearing from Artoo, the lanky
        robot jumps into the lifepod.

THREEPIO: I'm going to regret this.

INTERIOR: IMPERIAL STARDESTROYER.

        On the main viewscreen, the lifepod carrying the two terrified
        robots speeds away from the stricken Rebel spacecraft.

CHIEF PILOT: There goes another one.

CAPTAIN: Hold your fire. There are no life forms. It must have been
short-circuited.

INTERIOR: LIFEPOD.

        Artoo and Threepio look out at the receding Imperial starship.
        Stars circle as the pod rotates through the galaxy.

THREEPIO: That's funny, the damage doesn't look as bad from out here.

        Artoo beeps an assuring response.

THREEPIO: Are you sure this things safe?

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT -- POWER STATION -- DAY.

        Heat waves radiate from the dozen or so bleached white
        buildings. Luke pilots his Landspeeder through the dusty empty
        street of the tiny settlement. An old woman runs to get out of
        the way of the speeding vehicle, shaking her fist at Luke as
        he flies past.

WOMAN: I've told you kids to slow down!

INTERIOR: POWER STATION -- DAY.

        Luke bursts into the power station, waking The Fixer, a rugged
        mechanic and Camie, a sexy, disheveled girl who has been
        asleep in his lap. They grumbled as he races through the
        office, yelling wildly.

FIXER: Did I hear a young noise blast through here?

CAMIE: It was just wormie on another rampage.

           Luke bounces into a small room behind the office where Deak
        and Windy, two tough boys about the same age as Luke, are
        playing a computer pool-like game with Biggs, a burly,
        handsome boy a few years older than the rest. His flashy city
        attire is a sharp contrast to the loose-fitting tunics of the
        farm boys. A robot repairs some equipment in the background.

LUKE: Shape it up you guys!.... Biggs?

           Luke's surprise at the appearance of Biggs gives way to
        great joy and emotion. They give each other a great bear hug.

LUKE: I didn't know you were back! When did you get in?

BIGGS: Just now. I wanted to surprise you, hot shot. I thought you'd be
here...certainly didn't expect you to be out working. (he laughs.)

LUKE: The Academy didn't change you much...but you're back so soon?
Hey, what happened, didn't you get your commission?

           Biggs has an air of cool that seems slightly phony.

BIGGS: Of course I got it. Signed aboard The Rand Ecliptic last week.
First mate Biggs Darklighter at your service...(he salutes)...I just
came to say good-bye to all you unfortunate landlocked simpletons.

           Everyone laughs. The dazzling spectacle of his dashing
        friend is almost too much for Luke, but suddenly he snaps out
        of it.

LUKE: I almost forgot. There's a battle going on! Right here in our
system. Come and look!

DEAK: Not again! Forget it.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ANCHORHEAD -- SETTLEMENT -- POWER STATION -- DAY.

        The group stumbles out into the stifling desert sun. Camie and
        The Fixer complain and are forced to shade their eyes. Luke
        has his binoculars out scanning the heavens.

LUKE: There they are!

           Biggs takes the binoculars from Luke as the others strain
        to see something with the naked eye. Through the binoculars
        Biggs sees two small silver specks.

BIGGS: That's no battle, hot shot...they're just sitting there!
Probably a freighter-tanker refueling.

LUKE: But there was a lot of firing earlier...

           Camie grabs the binoculars away banging them against the
        building in the process. Luke grabs them.

LUKE: Hey, easy with those...

CAMIE: Don't worry about it, Wormie.

           The Fixer gives Luke a hard look and the young farm boy
        shrugs his shoulders in resignation.

FIXER: I keep telling you, the Rebellion is a long way from here. I
doubt if the Empire would even fight to keep this system. Believe me
Luke, this planet is a big hunk of nothing...

           Luke agrees, although it's obvious he isn't sure why. The
        group stumbles back into the power station, grumbling about
        Luke's ineptitude.

INTERIOR: REBEL BLOCKADE RUNNER -- HALLWAY

        Princess Leia is led down a low-ceilinged hallway by a squad
        of armored stormtroopers. Her hands are bound and she is
        brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly
        marching troops. They stop in a smoky hallway as Darth Vader
        emerges from the shadows. The sinister Dark Lord stares hard
        at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.

LEIA: Lord Vader, I should have known. Only you could be so bold. The
Imperial Senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked
a diplomatic...

VADER: Don't play games with me, Your Highness. You weren't on any
mercy mission this time. You passed directly through a restricted
system. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.
I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.

LEIA: I don't know what you're talking about. I'm a member of the
Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan...

VADER: You're a part of the Rebel Alliance...and a traitor. Take her
away!

           Leia is marched away down the hallway and into the
        smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. An Imperial
        Commander turns to Vader.

COMMANDER: Holding her is dangerous. If word of this gets out, it
could generate sympathy for the Rebellion in the senate.

VADER: I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link
to find their secret base!

COMMANDER: She'll die before she tells you anything.

VADER: Leave that to me. Send a distress signal and then inform the
senate that all aboard were killed!

           Another Imperial Officer approaches Vader and the
        Commander. They stop and snap to attention.

SECOND OFFICER: Lord Vader, the battle station plans are not aboard
this ship! And no transmissions were made. An escape pod was
jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.

           Vader turns to the Commander.

VADER: She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a
detachment down to retrieve them. See to it personally, Commander.
There'll be no one to stop us this time.

COMMANDER: Yes, sir.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The Imperial Stardestroyer comes over the surface of the
        planet Tatooine.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT.

        Jundland, or "No Man's Land", where the rugged desert mesas
        meet the foreboding dune sea. The two helpless astro-droids
        kick up clouds of sand as they leave the lifepod and clumsily
        work their way across the desert wasteland. The lifepod in the
        distance rests half buried in the sand.

THREEPIO: How did I get into this mess? I really don't know how. We
seem to be made to suffer. It's our lot in life.

           Artoo answers with beeping sounds.

THREEPIO: I've got to rest before I fall apart. My joints are almost
frozen. 

           Artoo continues to respond with beeping sounds.

THREEPIO: What a desolate place this is.

           Suddenly Artoo whistles, makes a sharp right turn and
        starts off in the direction of the rocky desert mesas. Threepio
        stops and yells at him.

THREEPIO: Where are you going?

           A stream of electronic noises pours forth from the small
        robot.

THREEPIO: Well, I'm not going that way. It's much too rocky. This way
is much easier.

           Artoo counters with a long whistle.

THREEPIO: What makes you think there are settlements over there?

           Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

THREEPIO: Don't get technical with me.

           Artoo continues to make beeping sounds.

THREEPIO: What mission? What are you talking about? I've had just
about enough of you! Go that way! You'll be malfunctioning within a
day, you nearsighted scrap pile!

           Threepio gives the little robot a kick and starts off in
        the direction of the vast dune sea.

THREEPIO: And don't let me catch you following me begging for help,
because you won't get it.

           Artoo's reply is a rather rude sound. He turns and trudges
        off in the direction of the towering mesas.

THREEPIO: No more adventures. I'm not going that way.

           Artoo beeps to himself as he makes his way toward the
        distant mountains.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DUNE SEA.

        Threepio, hot and tired, struggles up over the ridge of a dune;
        only to find more dunes, which seem to go on for endless
        miles.  He looks back in the direction of the now distant rock
        mesas. 

THREEPIO: That malfunctioning little twerp. This is all his fault! He
tricked me into going this way, but he'll do no better.

           In a huff of anger and frustration, Threepio knocks the
        sand from his joints. His plight seems hopeless, when a glint
        of reflected light in the distance reveals an object moving
        towards him.

THREEPIO: Wait, what's that? A transport! I'm saved!

           The bronze android waves frantically and yells at the
        approaching transport.

THREEPIO: Over here! Help! Please, help!

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ANCHORHEAD SETTLEMENT -- POWER STATION -- DAY.

        Luke and Biggs are walking and drinking a malt brew. Fixer and
        the others can be heard working inside.

LUKE: (Very animated)...so I cut off my power, shut down the
afterburners and came in low on Deak's trail. I was so close I thought
I was going to fry my instruments. As it was I busted up the Skyhopper
pretty bad. Uncle Owen was pretty upset. He grounded me for the rest
of the season. You should have been there...it was fantastic.

BIGGS: You ought to take it easy Luke. You may be the hottest
bushpilot this side of Mos Eisley, but those little Skyhoppers are
dangerous. Keep it up, and one day, whammo, you're going to be nothing
more than a dark spot on the down side of a canyon wall.

LUKE: Look who's talking. Now that you've been around those giant
starships you're beginning to sound like my uncle. You've gotten soft
in the city...

BIGGS: I've missed you kid.

LUKE: Well, things haven't been the same since you left, Biggs. It's
been so...quiet.

           Biggs looks around then leans close to Luke.

BIGGS: Luke, I didn't come back just to say good-bye...I shouldn't
tell you this, but you're the only one I can trust...and if I don't
come back, I want somebody to know.

           Luke's eyes are wide with Biggs' seriousness and loyalty.

LUKE: What are you talking about?

BIGGS: I made some friends at the Academy. (he whispers)...when our
frigate goes to one of the central systems, we're going to jump ship
and join the Alliance...

           Luke, amazed and stunned, is almost speechless.

LUKE: Join the Rebellion?! Are you kidding! How?

BIGGS: Quiet down will ya! You got a mouth bigger than a meteor
crater!

LUKE: I'm sorry. I'm quiet. (he whispers) Listen how quiet I am. You
can barely hear me...

           Biggs shakes his head angrily and then continues.

BIGGS: My friend has a friend on Bestine who might help us make
contact.

LUKE: Your crazy! You could wander around forever trying to find them.

BIGGS: I know it's a long shot, but if I don't find them I'll do what
I can on my own...It's what we always talked about. Luke, I'm not
going to wait for the Empire to draft me into service. The Rebellion
is spreading and I want to be on the right side -- the side I believe
in. 

LUKE: And I'm stuck here...

BIGGS: I thought you were going to the Academy next term. You'll get
your chance to get off this rock.

LUKE: Not likely! I had to cancel my application. There has been a lot
of unrest among the Sandpeople since you left...they've even raided
the outskirts of Anchorhead.

BIGGS: Your uncle could hold off a whole colony of Sandpeople with one
blaster.

LUKE: I know, but he's got enough vaporators going to make the place
pay off. He needs me for just one more season. I can't leave him now.

BIGGS: I feel for you, Luke, you're going to have to learn what seems
to be important or what really is important. What good is all your
uncle's work if it's taken over by the Empire?...You know they're
starting to nationalize commerce in the central systems...it won't be
long before your uncle is merely a tenant, slaving for the greater
glory of the Empire.

LUKE: It couldn't happen here. You said it yourself. The Empire won't
bother with this rock.

BIGGS: Things always change.

LUKE: I wish I was going...Are you going to be around long? 

BIGGS: No, I'm leaving in the morning...

LUKE: Then I guess I won't see you.

BIGGS: Maybe someday...I'll keep a lookout.

LUKE: Well, I'll be at the Academy next season...after that who knows.
I won't be drafted into the Imperial Starfleet that's for sure...Take
care of yourself, you'll always be the best friend I've got.

BIGGS: So long, Luke.

           Biggs turns away from his old friend and heads towards the
        power station.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- SUNSET.

        The gargantuan rock formations are shrouded in a strange
        foreboding mist and the onimous sounds of unearthly creatures
        fill the air. Artoo moves cautiously through the creepy rock
        canyon, inadvertently making a loud clicking noise as he goes.
        He hears a distant, hard, metallic sound and stops for a
        moment. Convinced he is alone, he continues on his way.
           In the distance, a pepple tumbles down the steep canyon
        wall and a small dark figure darts into the shadows. A little
        further up the canyon a slight flicker of light reveals a pair
        of eyes in the dark recesses only a few feet from the narrow
        path.
           The unsuspecting robot waddles along the rugged trail until
        suddenly, out of nowhere, a powerful magnetic ray shoots out
        of the rocks and engulfs him in an eerie glow. He manages one
        short electronic squeak before he topples over onto his back.
        His bright computer lights flicker off, then on, then off
        again. Out of the rocks scurry three Jawas, no taller than
        Artoo. They holster strange and complex weapons as they
        cautiously approach the robot. They wear grubby cloaks and
        their faces are shrouded so only their glowing eyes can be
        seen. They hiss and make odd guttural sounds as they heave the
        heavy robot onto their shoulders and carry him off down the
        trail. 

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- SANDCRAWLER -- SUNSET.

        The eight Jawas carry Artoo out of the canyon to a huge
        tank-like vehicle the size of a four-story house. They weld a
        small disk on the side of Artoo and then put him under a large
        tube on the side of the vehicle and the little robot is sucked
        into the giant machine.
           The filthy little Jawas scurry like rats up small ladders
        and enter the main cabin of the behemoth transport.

INTERIOR: SANDCRAWLER -- HOLD AREA.

        It is dim inside the hold area of the Sandcrawler. Artoo
        switches on a small floodlight on his forehead and stumbles
        around the scrap heap. The narrow beam swings across rusty
        metal rocket parts and an array of grotesquely twisted and
        maimed astro-robots. He lets out a pathetic electronic whimper
        and stumbles off toward what appears to be a door at the end
        of the chamber.

INTERIOR: SANDCRAWLER -- PRISON AREA.

        Artoo enters a wide room with a four-foot ceiling. In the
        middle of the scrap heap sit a dozen or so robots of various
        shapes and sizes. Some are engaged in electronic conversation,
        while others simply mill about. A voice of recognition calls
        out from the gloom.

THREEPIO: Artoo-Detoo! It's you! It's you!

           A battered Threepio scrambles up to Artoo and embraces him.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- SANDCRAWLER -- SUNSET.

        The enormous Sandcrawler lumbers off toward the magnificent
        twin suns, which are slowly setting over a distant mountain
        ridge.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT -- DAY.

        Four Imperial stormtroopers mill about in front of the half-
        buried lifepod that brought Artoo and Threepio to Tatooine. A
        trooper yells to an officer some distance away.

FIRST TROOPER: Someone was in the pod. The tracks go off in this
direction. 

           A second trooper picks a small bit of metal out of the sand
        and gives it to the first trooper.

SECOND TROOPER: Look, sir -- droids.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DUNES.

        The Sandcrawler moves slowly down a great sand dune.

INTERIOR: SANDCRAWLER.

        Threepio and Artoo noisily bounce along inside the cramped
        prison chamber. Artoo appears to be shut off.

THREEPIO: Wake up! Wake up!

           Suddenly the shaking and bouncing of the Sandcrawler stops,
        creating quite a commotion among the mechanical men.
        Threepio's fist bangs the head of Artoo whose computer lights
        pop on as he begins beeping. At the far end of the long
        chamber a hatch opens, filling the chamber with blinding white
        light. a dozen or so Jawas make their way through the odd
        assortment of robots.

THREEPIO: We're doomed.

           A Jawa starts moving toward them.

THREEPIO: Do you think they'll melt us down?

           Artoo responds, making beeping sounds.

THREEPIO: Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end?

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT -- LARS HOMESTEAD -- AFTERNOON.

        The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their
        battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of
        the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small
        homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground
        surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small
        adobe block house.
           The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots,
        straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented
        metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly,
        attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths
        and nostrils should be.
           Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen
        Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes
        are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully
        inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump-
        shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little
        Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales
        pitch in a queer, unintelligible language.
           A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the
        homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru
        standing in the main courtyard.

BERU: Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it
speaks Bocce.

LUKE: It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind
him.

           Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment
        for sale with the Jawa leader.

OWEN: I have no need for a protocol droid.

THREEPIO: (quickly) Sir -- not in an environment such as this --
that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary
functions that...

OWEN: What I really need is a droid that understands the binary
language of moisture vaporators.

THREEPIO: Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load
lifter...very similar to your vaporators. You could say...

OWEN: Do you speak Bocce?

THREEPIO: Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for
me...I'm as fluent in Bocce...

OWEN: All right shut up! (turning to Jawa) I'll take this one.

THREEPIO: Shutting up, sir.

OWEN: Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to
have both of them cleaned up before dinner.

LUKE: But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power
converters...

OWEN: You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done.
Now come on, get to it!

LUKE: All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on,
Red, let's go.

           As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots
        back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little
        beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is
        restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box.

           Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two
        robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head
        of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly.

LUKE: Uncle Owen...

OWEN: Yeah?

LUKE: This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look!

OWEN: (to the head Jawa) Hey, what're you trying to push on us?

           The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has
        sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to
        attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio
        taps Luke on the shoulder.

THREEPIO: (pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in
prime condition. A real bargain.

LUKE: Uncle Owen...

OWEN: Yeah?

LUKE: What about that one?

OWEN: (to Jawa) What about that blue one? We'll take that one.

           With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the
        damaged astro-droid for Artoo.

LUKE: Yeah, take it away.

THREEPIO: Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one,
sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him
before. Here he comes.

           Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots
        trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry.

LUKE: Okay, let's go.

THREEPIO: (to Artoo) Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my
neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity!

INTERIOR: LARS HOMESTEAD -- GARAGE AREA -- LATE AFTERNOON.

        The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful
        atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers
        himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the
        battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery
        with a cord to his face.

THREEPIO: Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good.
I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move!

           Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in
        thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small
        two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the
        garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and
        he slams a wrench across the workbench.

LUKE: It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out
of here!

THREEPIO: Is there anything I might do to help? 

           Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger
        drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face.

LUKE: Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or
teleport me off this rock!

THREEPIO: I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very
knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a
matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.

LUKE: Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the
planet that it's farthest from.

THREEPIO: I see, sir.

LUKE: Uh, you can call me Luke.

THREEPIO: I see, sir Luke.

LUKE: (laughing) Just Luke.

THREEPIO: And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is
my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo.

LUKE: Hello.

           Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to
        scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome
        pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil
        from his bronze body.

LUKE: You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys
have seen a lot of action.

THREEPIO: With all we've been through, sometimes I'm amazed we're in
as good condition as we are, what with the Rebellion and all.

LUKE: You know of the Rebellion against the Empire?

THREEPIO: That's how we came to be in your service, if you take my
meaning, sir.

LUKE: Have you been in many battles?

THREEPIO: Several, I think. Actually, there's not much to tell. I'm
not much more than an interpreter, and not very good at telling
stories. Well, not at making them interesting, anyways.

           Luke struggles to remove a small metal fragment from Artoo's
        neck joint. He uses a larger pick.

LUKE: Well, my little friend, you've got something jammed in here real
good. Were you on a cruiser or...

           The fragment breaks loose with a snap, sending Luke
        tumbling head over heels. He sits up and sees a twelve-inch
        three-dimensional hologram of Leia Organa, the Rebel senator,
        being projected from the face of little Artoo. The image is a
        rainbow of colors as it flickers and jiggles in the dimly lit
        garage. Luke's mouth hangs open in awe.

LEIA: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope.

LUKE: What's this?

           Artoo looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer for
        Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the sentence
        fragment over and over.

THREEPIO: What is what?!? He asked you a question...(pointing to Leia)
What is that?

           Artoo whistles his surprise as he pretends to just notice
        the hologram. He looks around and sheepishly beeps an answer
        for Threepio to translate. Leia continues to repeat the
        sentence fragment over and over.

LEIA: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi. You're my only hope. Help me, Obi-Wan
Kenobi. You're my only hope.

THREEPIO: Oh, he says it's nothing, sir. Merely a malfunction. Old
data. Pay it no mind.

           Luke becomes intrigued by the beautiful girl.

LUKE: Who is she? She's beautiful.

THREEPIO: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir.

LEIA: Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi...

THREEPIO: I think she was a passenger on our last voyage. A person of
some importance, sir -- I believe. Our captain was attached to...

LUKE: Is there more to this recording?

           Luke reaches out for Artoo but he lets out several frantic
        squeaks and a whistle.

THREEPIO: Behave yourself, Artoo. You're going to get us in trouble.
It's all right, you can trust him. He's our new master.

           Artoo whistles and beeps a long message to Threepio.

THREEPIO: He says he's the property of Obi-Wan Kenobi, a resident of
these parts. And it's a private message for him. Quite frankly, sir I
don't know what he's talking about. Our last master was Captain
Antilles, but with what we've been through, this little R2 unit has
become a bit eccentric.

LUKE: Obi-Wan Kenobi? I wonder if he means old Ben Kenobi?

THREEPIO: I beg your pardon, sir, but do you know what he's talking
about?

LUKE: Well, I don't know anyone named Obi-Wan, but old Ben lives out
beyond the dune sea. He's kind of a strange old hermit.

           Luke's gazes at the beautiful young princess for a few
        moments. 

LUKE: I wonder who she is. It sounds like she's in trouble. I'd better
play back the whole thing.

           Artoo beeps something to Threepio.

THREEPIO: He says the restraining bolt has short circuited his
recording system. He suggests that if you remove the bolt, he might be
able to play back the entire recording.

           Luke looks longingly at the lovely, little princess and
        hasn't really heard what Threepio has been saying.

LUKE: H'm? Oh, yeah, well, I guess you're too small to run away on me
if I take this off! Okay.

           Luke takes a wedged bar and pops the restraining bolt off
        Artoo's side.

LUKE: There you go.

           The princess immediately disappears...

LUKE: Well, wait a minute. Where'd she go? Bring her back! Play back
the entire message.

           Artoo beeps an innocent reply as Threepio sits up in
        embarrassment.

THREEPIO: What message? The one you're carrying inside your rusty
innards! 

           A women's voice calls out from another room.

AUNT BERU: Luke? Luke! Come to dinner!

           Luke stands up and shakes his head at the malfunctioning
        robot.

LUKE: All right, I'll be right there, Aunt Beru.

THREEPIO: I'm sorry, sir, but he appears to have picked up a slight
flutter.

           Luke tosses Artoo's restraining bolt on the workbench and
        hurries out of the room.

LUKE: Well, see what you can do with him. I'll be right back.

THREEPIO: (to Artoo) Just you reconsider playing that message for him.

           Artoo beeps in response.

THREEPIO: No, I don't think he likes you at all.

           Artoo beeps.

THREEPIO: No, I don't like you either.

INTERIOR: LARS HOMESTEAD -- DINING AREA.

         Luke's Aunt Beru, a warm, motherly woman, fills a pitcher
        with blue fluid from a refrigerated container in the well-used
        kitchen. She puts the pitcher on a tray with some bowls of
        food and starts for the dining area.
           Luke sits with his Uncle Owen before a table covered with
        steaming bowls of food as Aunt Beru carries in a bowl of red
        grain.

LUKE: You know, I think that R2 unit we bought might have been stolen.

OWEN: What makes you think that?

LUKE: Well, I stumbled across a recording while I was cleaning him. He
says he belongs to someone called Obi-Wan Kenobi.

           Owen is greatly alarmed at the mention of his name, but
        manages to control himself.

LUKE: I thought he might have meant old Ben. Do you know what he's
talking about? Well, I wonder if he's related to Ben.

           Owen breaks loose with a fit of uncontrolled anger.

OWEN: That old man's just a crazy old wizard. Tomorrow I want you to
take that R2 unit into Anchorhead and have its memory flushed. That'll
be the end of it. It belongs to us now.

LUKE: But what if this Obi-Wan comes looking for him?

OWEN: He won't, I don't think he exists any more. He died about the
same time as your father.

LUKE: He knew my father?

OWEN: I told you to forget it. Your only concern is to prepare the new
droids for tomorrow. In the morning I want them on the south ridge
working out those condensers.

LUKE: Yes, sir. I think those new droids are going to work out fine.
In fact, I, uh, was also thinking about our agreement about my staying
on another season. And if these new droids do work out, I want to
transmit my application to the Academy this year.

           Owen's face becomes a scowl, although he tries to suppress
        it.

OWEN: You mean the next semester before harvest?

LUKE: Sure, there're more than enough droids.

OWEN: Harvest is when I need you the most. Only one more season. This
year we'll make enough on the harvest so I'll be able to hire some
more hands. And then you can go to the Academy next year.

           Luke continues to toy with his food, not looking at his
        uncle.

OWEN: You must understand I need you here, Luke.

LUKE: But it's a whole 'nother year.

OWEN: Look, it's only one more season.

           Luke pushes his half-eaten plate of food aside and stands.

LUKE: Yeah, that's what you said last year when Biggs and Tank left.

AUNT BERU: Where are you going?

LUKE: It looks like I'm going nowhere. I have to finish cleaning those
droids.

           Resigned to his fate, Luke paddles out of the room. Owen
        mechanically finishes his dinner.

AUNT BERU: Owen, he can't stay here forever. Most of his friends have
gone. It means so much to him.

OWEN: I'll make it up to him next year. I promise.

AUNT BERU: Luke's just not a farmer, Owen. He has too much of his
father in him.

OWEN: That's what I'm afraid of.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- LARS HOMESTEAD.

        The giant twin suns of Tatooine slowly disappear behind a
        distant dune range. Luke stands watching them for a few
        moments, then reluctantly enters the doomed entrance to the
        homestead.

INTERIOR: LARS HOMESTEAD -- GARAGE.

           Luke enters the garage to discover the robots nowhere in
        sight. He takes a small control box from his utility belt
        similar to the one the Jawas were carrying. He activates the
        box, which creates a low hum, and Threepio, letting out a
        short yell, pops up from behind the Skyhopper spaceship.

LUKE: What are you doing hiding there?

           Threepio stumbles forward, but Artoo is still nowhere in
        sight. 

THREEPIO: It wasn't my fault, sir. Please don't deactivate me. I told
him not to go, but he's faulty, malfunctioning; kept babbling on about
his mission.

LUKE: Oh, no!

        Luke races out of the garage followed by Threepio.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- LARS HOMESTEAD.

        Luke rushes out of the small doomed entry to the homestead and
        searches the darkening horizon for the small triped astro-
        robot. Threepio struggles out of the homestead and on the salt
        flat as Luke scans the landscape with his electrobinoculars.

THREEPIO: That R2 unit has always been a problem. These astro-droids
are getting quite out of hand. Even I can't understand their logic at
times. 

LUKE: How could I be so stupid? He's nowhere in sight. Blast it!

THREEPIO: Pardon me, sir, but couldn't we go after him?

LUKE: It's too dangerous with all the Sandpeople around. We'll have to
wait until morning.

           Owen yells up from the homestead plaza.

OWEN: Luke, I'm shutting the power down for the night.

LUKE: All right, I'll be there in a few minutes. Boy, am I gonna get it.

        He takes one final look across the dim horizon.

LUKE: You know that little droid is going to cause me a lot of
trouble.

THREEPIO: Oh, he excels at that, sir.

INTERIOR: LARS HOMESTEAD -- PLAZA.

        Morning slowly creeps into the sparse but sparkling oasis of
        the open courtyard. The idyll is broken be the yelling of
        Uncle Owen, his voice echoing throughout the homestead.

OWEN: Luke? Luke? Luke? Where could he be loafing now!

INTERIOR: LARS HOMESTEAD -- KITCHEN.

        The interior of the kitchen is a worm glow as Aunt Beru prepares
        the morning breakfast. Owen enters in a huff.

OWEN: Have you seen Luke this morning?

AUNT BERU: He said he had some things to do before he started today,
so he left early.

OWEN: Uh? Did he take those two new droids with him?

AUNT BERU: I think so.

OWEN: Well, he'd better have those units in the south range repaired
be midday or there'll be hell to pay!

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- DESERT WASTELAND -- LUKE'S SPEEDER -- DAY.

        The rock and sand of the desert floor are a blur as Threepio
        pilots the sleek Landspeeder gracefully across the vast
        wasteland. 

INTERIOR/EXTERIOR: LUKE'S SPEEDER -- DESERT WASTELAND -- TRAVELING -- DAY.

        Luke leans over the back of the speeder and adjusts something
        in the motor compartment.

LUKE: (yelling) How's that.

           Threepio signals that is fine and Luke turns back into the
        wind-whipped cockpit and pops the canopy shut.

LUKE: Old Ben Kenobi lives out in this direction somewhere, but I
don't see how that R2 unit could have come this far. We must have
missed him. Uncle Owen isn't going to take this very well.

THREEPIO: Sir, would it help if you told him it was my fault.

LUKE: (brightening) Sure. He needs you. He'd probably only deactivate
you for a day or so...

THREEPIO: Deactivate! Well, on the other hand if you hadn't removed
his restraining bolt...

LUKE: Wait, there's something dead ahead on the scanner. It looks like
our droid...hit the accelerator.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK MESA -- DUNE SEA -- COASTLINE -- DAY.

        From high on a rock mesa, the tiny Landspeeder can be seen
        gliding across the desert floor. Suddenly in the foreground
        two weather-beaten Sandpeople shrouded in their grimy desert
        cloaks peer over the edge of the rock mesa. One of the
        marginally human creatures raises a long ominous laser rifle
        and points it at the speeder but the second creature grabs the
        gun before it can be fired.
           The Sandpeople, or Tusken Raiders as they're sometimes
        called, speak in a coarse barbaric language as they get into
        an animated argument. The second Tusken Raider seems to get in
        the final word and the nomads scurry over the rocky terrain.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK MESA -- CANYON.

        The Tusken Raider approaches two large Banthas standing tied
        to a rock. The monstrous, bear-like creatures are as large as
        elephants, with huge red eyes, tremendous looped horns, and
        long, furry, dinosaur-like tails. The Tusken Raiders mount
        saddles strapped to the huge creatures' shaggy backs and ride
        off down the rugged bluff.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- FLOOR.

        The speeder is parked on the floor of a massive canyon. Luke,
        with his long laser rifle slung over his shoulder, stands
        before little Artoo.

LUKE: Hey, whoa, just where do you think you're going?

           The little droid whistles a feeble reply, as Threepio poses
        menacingly behind the little runaway.

THREEPIO: Master Luke here is your rightful owner. We'll have no more
of this Obi-Wan Kenobi jibberish...and don't talk to me about your
mission, either. You're fortunate he doesn't blast you into a million
pieces right here.

LUKE: Well, come on. It's getting late. I only hope we can get back
before Uncle Owen really blows up.

THREEPIO: If you don't mind my saying so, sir, I think you should
deactivate the little fugitive until you've gotten him back to your
workshop.

LUKE: No, he's not going to try anything.

           Suddenly the little robot jumps to life with a mass of
        frantic whistles and screams.

LUKE: What's wrong with him now?

THREEPIO: Oh my...sir, he says there are several creatures approaching
from the southeast.

           Luke swings his rifle into position and looks to the south.

LUKE: Sandpeople! Or worst! Come on, let's have a look. Come on.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- RIDGE -- DAY.

        Luke carefully makes his way to the top of a rock ridge and
        scans the canyon with his electrobinoculars. He spots the two
        riderless Banthas. Threepio struggles up behind the young
        adventurer.

LUKE: There are two Banthas down there but I don't see any...wait a
second, they're Sandpeople all right. I can see one of them now.

           Luke watches the distant Tusken Raider through his
        electrobinoculars. Suddenly something huge moves in front of
        his field of view. Before Luke or Threepio can react, a large,
        gruesome Tusken Raider looms over them. Threepio is startled
        and backs away, right off the side if the cliff. He can be
        heard for several moments as he clangs, bangs and rattles down
        the side of the mountain.
           The towering creature brings down his curved,
        double-pointed gaderffii -- the dreaded axe blade that has
        struck terror in the heart of the local settlers. But Luke
        manages to block the blow with his laser rifle, which is
        smashed to pieces. The terrified farm boy scrambles backward
        until he is forced to the edge of a deep crevice. The sinister
        Raider stands over him with his weapon raised and lets out a
        horrible shrieking laugh.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- ROCK CANYON -- FLOOR -- DAY.

        Artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the
        rocks as the vicious Sandpeople walk past carrying the inert
        Luke Skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder.
        The Sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and
        supplies in all directions. Suddenly they stop. Then
        everything is quiet for a few moments. A great howling moan is
        heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the Sandpeople
        fleeing in terror.
           Artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight
        swishing sound that frightened off the Sandpeople grows even
        closer, until a shabby old desert-rat-of-a-man appears and
        leans over Luke. His ancient leathery face, cracked and
        weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating
        eyes and a scraggly white beard. Ben Kenobi squints his eyes
        as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. Artoo makes a
        slight sound and Ben turns and looks right at him.

BEN: Hello there! Come here my little friend. Don't be afraid.

        Artoo waddles over to were Luke lies crumpled in a 
        heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. Ben
        puts his hand on Luke's forehead and he begins to 
        come around.

BEN: Don't worry, he'll be all right.

LUKE: What happened?

BEN: Rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. You're fortunate you're
still in one piece.

LUKE: Ben? Ben Kenobi! Boy, am I glad to see you! 

BEN: The Jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. Tell me young
Luke, what brings you out this far?

LUKE: Oh, this little droid! I think he's searching for his former
master...I've never seen such devotion in a droid before...there
seems to be no stopping him. He claims to be the property of an Obi-
Wan Kenobi. Is he a relative of yours? Do you know who he's talking 
about?

        Ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.

BEN: Obi-Wan Kenobi...Obi-Wan? Now thats a name I haven't heard in a 
long time...a long time.

LUKE: I think my uncle knew him. He said he was dead.

BEN: Oh, he's not dead, not...not yet.

LUKE: You know him!

BEN: Well of course, of course I know him. He's me! I haven't gone by
the name Obi-Wan since oh, before you were born.

LUKE: Then the droid does belong to you.

BEN: Don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. Very interesting...

        He suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.

BEN: I think we better get indoors. The Sandpeople are easily startled
but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.

        Luke sits up and rubs his head. Artoo lets out a pathetic
        beep causing Luke to remember something. He looks around.

LUKE: Threepio!

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- SAND PIT -- ROCK MESA -- DAY.

        Little Artoo stands at the edge of a large sand pit and begins
        to chatter away in electronic whistles and beeps. Luke and Ben
        stand over a very dented and tangled Threepio lying half
        buried in the sand. One of his arms has broken off.
           Luke tries to revive the inert robot by shaking him and
        then flips a hidden switch on his back several times until
        finally the mechanical man's systems turn on.

THREEPIO: Where am I? I must have taken a bad step...

LUKE: Can you stand? We've got to get out of here before the
Sandpeople return.

THREEPIO: I don't think I can make it. You go on, Master Luke. There's
no sense in you risking yourself on my account. I'm done for.
        
           Artoo makes a beeping sound.

LUKE: No, you're not. What kind of talk is that?

           Luke and Ben help the battered robot to his feet. Little
        Artoo watches from the top of the pit. Ben glances around
        suspiciously. Sensing something, he stands up and sniffs the
        air.

BEN: Quickly, son...they're on the move.

INTERIOR: KENOBI'S DWELLING.

        The small, spartan hovel is cluttered with desert junk but
        still manages to radiate an air of time-worn comfort and
        security. Luke is in one corner repairing Threepio's arm, as
        old Ben sits thinking.

LUKE: No, my father didn't fight in the wars. He was a navigator on a
spice freighter.

BEN: That's what your uncle told you. He didn't hold with your
father's ideals. Thought he should have stayed here and not gotten
involved.

LUKE: You fought in the Clone Wars?

BEN: Yes, I was once a Jedi Knight the same as your father.

LUKE: I wish I'd known him.

BEN: He was the best star-pilot in the galaxy, and a cunning warrior.
I understand you've become quite a good pilot yourself. And he was a
good friend. Which reminds me...

           Ben gets up and goes to a chest where he rummages around.
        As Luke finishes repairing Threepio and starts to fit the
        restraining bolt back on, Threepio looks at him nervously.
        Luke thinks about the bolt for a moment then puts it on the
        table. Ben shuffles up and presents Luke with a short handle
        with several electronic gadgets attached to it.

BEN: I have something here for you. Your father wanted you to have
this when you were old enough, but your uncle wouldn't allow it. He
feared you might follow old Obi-Wan on some damned-fool idealistic
crusade like your father did. 

THREEPIO: Sir, if you'll not be needing me, I'll close down for
awhile.

LUKE: Sure, go ahead.

           Ben hands Luke the saber.

LUKE: What is it?

BEN: Your fathers lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not
as clumsy or as random as a blaster.
                
           Luke pushes a button on the handle. A long beam shoots out
        about four feet and flickers there. The light plays across the
        ceiling.

BEN: An elegant weapon for a more civilized time. For over a thousand
generations the Jedi Knights were the guardians of peace and justice
in the Old Republic. Before the dark times, before the Empire.

           Luke hasn't really been listening.

LUKE: How did my father die?

BEN: A young Jedi named Darth Vader, who was a pupil of mine until he
turned to evil, helped the Empire hunt down and destroy the Jedi
Knights. He betrayed and murdered your father. Now the Jedi are all
but extinct. Vader was seduced by the dark side of the Force.

LUKE: The Force?

BEN: Well, the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It's an energy
field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us.
It binds the galaxy together.

           Artoo makes beeping sounds.

BEN: Now, let's see if we can't figure out what you are, my little
friend. And where you come from.

LUKE: I saw part of the message he was...

           Luke is cut short as the recorded image of the beautiful
        young Rebel princess is projected from Artoo's face.

BEN: I seem to have found it.

           Luke stops his work as the lovely girl's image flickers
        before his eyes.

LEIA: General Kenobi, years ago you served my father in the Clone
Wars. Now he begs you to help him in his struggle against the Empire.
I regret that I am unable to present my father's request to you in
person, but my ship has fallen under attack and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed. I have placed information vital
to the survival of the Rebellion into the memory systems of this R2
unit. My father will know how to retrieve it. You must see this droid
safely delivered to him on Alderaan. This is our most desperate hour.
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope.

        There is a little static and the transmission is cut short.
        Old Ben leans back and scratches his head. He silently puffs
        on a tarnished chrome water pipe. Luke has stars in his eyes.

BEN: You must learn the ways of the Force if you're to come with me to
Alderaan.

LUKE: (laughing) Alderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go
home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is.

BEN: I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old
for this sort of thing.

LUKE: I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like
the Empire. I hate it! But there's nothing I can do about it right
now. It's such a long way from here.

BEN: That's your uncle talking.

LUKE: (sighing) Oh, God, my uncle. How am I ever going to explain
this?

BEN: Learn about the Force, Luke.

LUKE: Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead. You can get a
transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.

BEN: You must do what you feel is right, of course.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        An Imperial Stardestroyer heads toward the evil planet-like
        battle station: the Death Star!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONFERENCE ROOM.

        Eight Imperial senators and generals sit around a black
        conference table. Imperial stormtroopers stand guard around
        the room. Commander Tagge, a young, slimy-looking general, is
        speaking.

TAGGE: Until this battle station is fully operational we are
vulnerable. The Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. They're more
dangerous than you realize.

           The bitter Admiral Motti twists nervously in his chair.

MOTTI: Dangerous to your starfleet, Commander, not to this battle
station!

TAGGE: The Rebellion will continue to gain a support in the Imperial
Senate as long as....

           Suddenly all heads turn as Commander Tagge's speech is cut
        short and the Grand Moff Tarkin, governor of the Imperial
        outland regions, enters. He is followed by his powerful ally,
        The Sith Lord, Darth Vader. All of the generals stand and bow
        before the thin, evil-looking governor as he takes his place
        at the head of the table. The Dark Lord stands behind him.

TARKIN: The Imperial Senate will no longer be of any concern to us.
I've just received word that the Emperor has dissolved the council
permanently. The last remnants of the Old Republic have been swept
away.

TAGGE: That's impossible! How will the Emperor maintain control
without the bureaucracy?

TARKIN: The regional governors now have direct control over
territories. Fear will keep the local systems in line. Fear of this
battle station.

TAGGE: And what of the Rebellion? If the Rebels have obtained a
complete technical readout of this station, it is possible, however
unlikely, that they might find a weakness and exploit it.

VADER: The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.

MOTTI: Any attack made by the Rebels against this station would be a
useless gesture, no matter what technical data they've obtained. This
station is now the ultimate power in the universe. I suggest we use
it!

VADER: Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've
constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to
the power of the Force.

MOTTI: Don't try to frighten us with your sorcerer's ways, Lord Vader.
Your sad devotion to that ancient religion has not helped you conjure
up the stolen data tapes, or given you clairvoyance enough to find the
Rebel's hidden fort...

           Suddenly Motti chokes and starts to turn blue under Vader's
        spell.

VADER: I find your lack of faith disturbing.

TARKIN: Enough of this! Vader, release him!

VADER: As you wish.

TARKIN: This bickering is pointless. Lord Vader will provide us with
the location of the Rebel fortress by the time this station is
operational. We will then crush the Rebellion with one swift stroke.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- WASTELAND.

        The speeder stops before what remains of the huge Jawas
        Sandcrawler. Luke and Ben walk among the smoldering rubble
        and scattered bodies.

LUKE: It looks like Sandpeople did this, all right. Look, here are
Gaffi sticks, Bantha tracks. It's just...I never heard of them hitting
anything this big before.

           Ben is crouching in the sand studying the tracks.

BEN: They didn't. But we are meant to think they did. These tracks are
side by side. Sandpeople always ride single file to hide there numbers.

LUKE: These are the same Jawas that sold us Artoo and Threepio.

BEN: And these blast points, too accurate for Sandpeople. Only
Imperial stormtroopers are so precise.

LUKE: Why would Imperial troops want to slaughter Jawas?

           Luke looks back at the speeder where Artoo and Threepio are
        inspecting the dead Jawas, and put two and two together.

LUKE: If they traced the robots here, they may have learned who they
sold them to. And that would lead them home!

           Luke reaches a sudden horrible realization, then races for
        the speeder and jumps it.

BEN: Wait, Luke! It's too dangerous.

           Luke races off leaving Ben and the two robots alone with
        the burning Sandcrawler.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- WASTELAND.

        Luke races across the wasteland in his battered Landspeeder.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- LARS HOMESTEAD.

        The speeder roars up to the burning homestead. Luke jumps out
        and runs to the smoking holes that were once his home. Debris
        is scattered everywhere and it looks as if a great battle has
        taken place.

LUKE: Uncle Owen! Aunt Beru! Uncle Owen!

           Luke stumbles around in a daze looking for his aunt and
        uncle. Suddenly he comes upon their smoldering remains. He is
        stunned, and cannot speak. Hate replaces fear and a new
        resolve comes over him.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        Imperial TIE fighter races toward the Death Star.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- DETENTION CORRIDOR.

        Two stormtroopers open an electronic cell door and allow
        several Imperial guards to enter. Princess Leia's face is
        filled with defiance, which slowly gives way to fear as a
        giant black torture robot enters, followed by Darth Vader.

VADER: And, now Your Highness, we will discuss the location of your
hidden Rebel base.

           The torture robot gives off a steady beeping sound as it
        approaches Princess Leia and extends one of its mechanical
        arms bearing a large hypodermic needle. The door slides shut
        and the long cell block hallway appears peaceful. The muffled
        screams of the Rebel princess are barely heard.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- WASTELAND.

        There is a large bonfire of Jawa bodies blazing in front of
        the Sandcrawler as Ben and the robots finish burning the dead.
        Luke drives up in the speeder and Ben walks over to him.

BEN: There's nothing you could have done, Luke, had you been there.
You'd have been killed, too, and the droids would be in the hands of
the Empire.

LUKE: I want to come with you to Alderaan. There's nothing here for me
now. I want to learn the ways of the Force and become a Jedi like my
father.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- WASTELAND.

        The Landspeeder with Luke, Artoo, Threepio, and Ben in it
        zooms across the desert. The speeder stops on a bluff
        overlooking the spaceport at Mos Eisley. It is a haphazard
        array of low, grey, concrete structures and semi-domes. A
        harsh gale blows across the stark canyon floor. Luke adjusts
        his goggles and walks to the edge of the craggy bluff where
        Ben is standing.

BEN: Mos Eisley Spaceport. You will never find a more wretched hive of
scum and villainy. We must be cautious.

           Ben looks over at Luke, who gives the old Jedi a determined
        smile.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- STREET.

        The speeder is stopped on a crowded street by several
        combat-hardend stormtroopers who look over the two robots. A
        Trooper questions Luke.

TROOPER: How long have you had these droids?

LUKE: About three or four seasons.

BEN: They're for sale if you want them.

TROOPER: Let me see your identification.

           Luke becomes very nervous as he fumbles to find his ID
        while Ben speaks to the Trooper in a very controlled voice.

BEN: You don't need to see his identification.

TROOPER: We don't need to see his identification.

BEN: These are not the droids your looking for.

TROOPER: These are not the droids we're looking for.

BEN: He can go about his business.

TROOPER: You can go about your business.

BEN: (to Luke) Move along.

TROOPER: Move along. Move along.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- STREET.

        The speeder pulls up in front of a rundown blockhouse cantina
        on the outskirts of the spaceport. Various strange forms of
        transport, including several unusual beasts of burden, are
        parked outside the bar. A Jawa runs up and begins to fondle
        the speeder.

THREEPIO: I can't abide these Jawas. Disgusting creatures.

           As Luke gets out of the speeder he tries to shoo the Jawa
        away.
      
LUKE: Go on, go on. I can't understand how we got by those troopers. I
thought we were dead.

BEN: The Force can have a strong influence on the weak-minded. You
will find it a powerful ally.

LUKE: Do you really think we're going to find a pilot here that'll
take us to Alderaan?

BEN: Well, most of the best freighter pilots can be found here. Only
watch your step. This place can be a little rough.

LUKE: I'm ready for anything.

THREEPIO: Come along, Artoo.

INTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- CANTINA.

        The young adventurer and his two mechanical servants follow
        Ben Kenobi into the smoke-filled cantina. The murky, moldy den
        is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien
        creatures and monsters at the long metallic bar. At first the
        sight is horrifying. One-eyed, thousand-eyed, slimy, furry,
        scaly, tentacled, and clawed creatures huddle over drinks. Ben
        moves to an empty spot at the bar near a group of repulsive
        but human scum. A huge, rough-looking Bartender stops Luke and
        the robots.

BARTENDER: We don't serve their kind here!

           Luke still recovering from the shock of seeing so many
        outlandish creatures, doesn't quite catch the bartender's
        drift.

LUKE: What?

BARTENDER: Your droids. They'll have to wait outside. We don't want
them here.

           Luke looks at old Ben, who is busy talking to one of the
        Galactic pirates. He notices several of the gruesome creatures
        along the bar are giving him a very unfriendly glare.
           Luke pats Threepio on the shoulder.

LUKE: Listen, why don't you wait out by the speeder. We don't want any
trouble.

THREEPIO: I heartily agree with you sir.

        Threepio and his stubby partner go outside and most of the
        creatures at the bar go back to their drinks.
           Ben is standing next to Chewbacca, an eight-foot-tall-
        savage-looking creature resembling a huge grey bushbaby monkey
        with fierce baboon-like fangs. His large blue eyes dominate a
        fur-covered face and soften his otherwise awesome appearance.
        Over his matted, furry body he wears two chrome bandoliers,
        and little else. He is a two-hundred-year-old Wookiee and a
        sight to behold.
           Ben speaks to the Wookiee, pointing to Luke several times
        during his conversation and the huge creature suddenly lets
        out a horrifying laugh. Luke is more than a little bit
        disconcerted and pretends not to hear the conversation between
        Ben and the giant Wookiee.
           Luke is terrified but tries not to show it. He quietly sips
        his drink, looking over the crowd for a more sympathetic ear
        or whatever. 
           A large, multiple-eyed Creature gives Luke a rough shove.

CREATURE: Negola dewaghi wooldugger?!?

           The hideous freak is obviously drunk. Luke tries to ignore
        the creature and turns back on his drink. A short, grubby
        Human and an even smaller rodent-like beast join the
        belligerent monstrosity.

HUMAN: He doesn't like you.

LUKE: I'm sorry.

HUMAN: I don't like you either

           The big creature is getting agitated and yells out some
        unintelligible gibberish at the now rather nervous, young
        adventurer.

HUMAN: (continued) Don't insult us. You just watch yourself. We're
wanted men. I have the death sentence in twelve systems.

LUKE: I'll be careful than.

HUMAN: You'll be dead.

           The rodent lets out a loud grunt and everything at the bar
        moves away. Luke tries to remain cool but it isn't easy. His
        three adversaries ready their weapons. Old Ben moves in behind
        Luke.

BEN: This little one isn't worth the effort. Come let me buy you
something...

           A powerful blow from the unpleasant creature sends the
        young would-be Jedi sailing across the room, crashing through
        tables and breaking a large jug filled with a foul-looking
        liquid. With a blood curdling shriek, the monster draws a
        wicked chrome laser pistol from his belt and levels it at old
        Ben. The bartender panics.

BARTENDER: No blasters! No blaster!

           With astounding agility old Ben's laser sword sparks to
        life and in a flash an arm lies on the floor. The rodent is
        cut in two and the giant multiple-eyed creature lies doubled,
        cut from chin to groin. Ben carefully and precisely turns off
        his laser sword and replaces it on his utility belt. Luke,
        shaking and totally amazed at the old man's abilities, attempts
        to stand. The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds.
        The cantina goes back to normal, although Ben is given a
        respectable amount of room at the bar. Luke, rubbing his
        bruised head, approaches the old man with new awe. Ben points
        the the Wookiee.

BEN: This is Chewbacca. He's first-mate on a ship that might suit our
needs.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- STREET.

        Threepio paces in front of the cantina as Artoo carries on an
        electronic conversation with another little red astro-droid. A
        creature comes out of the cantina and approaches two
        stormtroopers in the street.

THREEPIO: I don't like the look of this.

INTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- CANTINA.

        Strange creatures play exotic big band music on odd-looking
        instruments as Luke, still giddy, downs a fresh drink and
        follows Ben and Chewbacca to a booth where Han Solo is
        sitting. Han is a tough, roguish starpilot about thirty years
        old. A mercenary on a starship, he is simple, sentimental, and
        cocksure.

HAN: Han Solo. I'm captain of the Millennium Falcon. Chewie here tells
me you're looking for passage to the Alderaan system.

BEN: Yes, indeed. If it's a fast ship.

HAN: Fast ship? You've never heard of the Millennium Falcon?

BEN: Should I have?

HAN: It's the ship that made the Kessel run in less than twelve
parsecs!

           Ben reacts to Solo's stupid attempt to impress them with
        obvious misinformation.

HAN: (continued) I've outrun Imperial starships, not the local
bulk-cruisers, mind you. I'm talking about the big Corellian ships
now. She's fast enough for you, old man. What's the cargo?

BEN: Only passengers. Myself, the boy, two droids, and no questions
asked.

HAN: What is it? Some kind of local trouble?

BEN: Let's just say we'd like to avoid any Imperial entanglements.

HAN: Well, that's the trick, isn't it? And it's going to cost you
something extra. Ten thousand in advance.

LUKE: Ten thousand? We could almost buy our own ship for that!

HAN: But who's going to fly it, kid! You?

LUKE: You bet I could. I'm not such a bad pilot myself! We don't have
to sit here and listen...

BEN: We haven't that much with us. But we could pay you two thousand
now, plus fifteen when we reach Alderaan.

HAN: Seventeen, huh!

           Han ponders this for a few moments.

HAN: Okay. You guys got yourself a ship. We'll leave as soon as you're
ready. Docking bay Ninety-four.

BEN: Ninety-four.

HAN: Looks like somebody's beginning to take an interest in your
handiwork.

           Ben and Luke turn around to see four Imperial stormtroopers
        looking at the dead bodies and asking the bartenders some
        questions. The bartender points to the booth.

TROOPER: All right, we'll check it out.

           The stormtroopers look over at the booth but Luke and Ben
        are gone. The bartender shrugs his shoulders in puzzlement.

HAN: Seventeen thousand! Those guys must really be desperate. This
could really save my neck. Get back to the ship and get her ready.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- STREET.

BEN: You'll have to sell your speeder.

LUKE: That's okay. I'm never coming back to this planet again.

INTERIOR: MOS EISLEY -- CANTINA.

        As Han is about to leave, Greedo, a slimy green-faced alien 
        with a short trunk-nose, pokes a gun in his side. The creature
        speaks in a foreign tongue translated into English subtitles.

GREEDO: Going somewhere, Solo?

HAN: Yes, Greedo. As a matter of fact, I was just going to see your
boss. Tell Jabba that I've got his money.

           Han sits down and the alien sits across from him holding
        the gun on him.

GREEDO: It's too late. You should have paid him when you had the
chance. Jabba's put a price on your head, so large that every bounty
hunter in the galaxy will be looking for you. I'm lucky I found you
first.

HAN: Yeah, but this time I got the money.

GREEDO: If you give it to me, I might forget I found you.

HAN: I don't have it with me. Tell Jabba...

GREEDO: Jabba's through with you. He has no time for smugglers who
drop their shipments at the first sign of an Imperial cruiser.

HAN: Even I get boarded sometimes. Do you think I had a choice?
        
           Han Solo slowly reaches for his gun under the table.

GREEDO: You can tell that to Jabba. He may only take your ship.

HAN: Over my dead body.

GREEDO: That's the idea. I've been looking forward to killing you for
a long time.

HAN: Yes, I'll bet you have.

           Suddenly the slimy alien disappears in a blinding flash of
        light. Han pulls his smoking gun from beneath the table as the
        other patron look on in bemused amazement. Han gets up and
        starts out of the cantina, flipping the bartender some coins
        as he leaves.

HAN: Sorry about the mess.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        Several TIE fighters approach the Death Star.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONTROL ROOM.

VADER: Her resistance to the mind probe is considerable. It will be
some time before we can extract any information from her.

           An Imperial Officer interrupts the meeting.

IMPERIAL OFFICER: The final check-out is complete. All systems are
operational. What course shall we set?

TARKIN: Perhaps she would respond to an alternative form of
persuasion.

VADER: What do you mean?

TARKIN: I think it is time we demonstrate the full power of this
station. (to soldier) Set your course for Princess Leia's home planet
of Alderaan.

TROOPER: With pleasure.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- STREET.

        Four heavily-armed stormtroopers move menacingly along a
        narrow slum alleyway crowed with darkly clad creatures hawking
        exotic goods in the dingy little stalls. Men, monsters, and
        robots crouch in the waste-filled doorways, whispering and
        hiding from the hot winds.

THREEPIO: Lock the door, Artoo.

           One of the troopers checks a tightly locked door and moves
        on down the alleyway. The door slides open a crack and
        Threepio peeks out. Artoo is barely visible in the background.

TROOPER: All right, check that side of the street. It's secure. Move
on to the next door.

           The door opens, Threepio moves into the doorway.

THREEPIO: I would much rather have gone with Master Luke than stay
here with you. I don't know what all the trouble is about, but I'm
sure it must be your fault.

           Artoo makes beeping sounds.

THREEPIO: You watch your language!

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- STREET -- ALLEYWAY -- USED SPEEDER LOT.

        Ben and Luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot,
        talking with a tall, grotesque, insect-like used speeder
        dealer. Strange exotic bodies and spindly-legged beasts pass
        by as the insect concludes the sale by giving Luke some coins.

LUKE: He says it's the best he can do. Since the XP-38 came out,
they're just not in demand.

BEN: It will be enough.

           Ben and Luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty
        alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater-like
        creatures. Luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his
        faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. A darkly clad creature
        moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they
        disappear down another alley.

BEN: If the ship's as fast as he's boasting, we ought to do well.

EXTERIOR: DOCKING PORT ENTRY -- ALLEYWAY.

        Chewbacca waits restlessly at the entrance to Docking Bay 94.
        Ben, Luke, and the robots make their way up the street.
        Chewbacca jabbers excitedly and signals for them to hurry. The
        darkly clad creature has followed them from the speeder lot.
        He stops in a nearby doorway and speaks into a small
        transmitter.

INTERIOR: MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT -- DOCKING BAY 94

        Chewbacca leads the group into a giant dirt pit that is Docking
        Bay 94. Resting in the middle of the huge hole is a large,
        round, beat-up, pieced-together hunk of junk that could only
        loosely be called a starship.

LUKE: What a piece of junk.

           The tall figure of Han Solo comes down the boarding ramp.

HAN: She'll make point five beyond the speed of light. She may not
look like much, but she's got it where it counts, kid. I've added some
special modifications myself.

           Luke scratches his head. It's obvious he isn't sure about
        all this. Chewbacca rushes up the ramp and urges the others to
        follow.

HAN: We're a little rushed, so if you'll hurry aboard we'll get out of
here.

           The group rushes up the gang plank, passing a grinning Han
        Solo.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON.

        Chewbacca settles into the pilot's chair and starts the mighty
        engines of the starship.

INTERIOR: MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT -- DOCKING BAY 94.

        Luke, Ben, Threepio, and Artoo move toward the Millennium
        Falcon passing Solo.

THREEPIO: Hello, sir.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- STREET.

        Eight Imperial stormtroopers rush up to the darkly clad
        creature.

TROOPER: Which way?

           The darkly clad creature points to the door of the docking
        bay.

TROOPER: All right, men. Load your weapons!

INTERIOR: MOS EISLEY SPACEPORT -- DOCKING BAY 94.

        The troops hold their guns at the ready and charge down the
        docking bay entrance.

TROOPER: Stop that ship!

           Han Solo looks up and sees the Imperial stormtroopers
        rushing into the docking bay. Several of the troopers fire at
        Han as he ducks into the spaceship.

TROOPER: Blast 'em!

           Han draws his laser pistol and pops off a couple of shots
        which force the stormtroopers to dive for safety. The
        pirateship engines whine as Han hits the release button that
        slams the overhead entry shut.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON.

HAN: Chewie, get us out of here!

           The group straps in for take off.

THREEPIO: Oh, my. I'd forgotten how much I hate space travel.

EXTERIOR: TATOOINE -- MOS EISLEY -- STREETS.

        The half-dozen stormtroopers at a check point hear the general
        alarm and look to the sky as the huge starship rises above the
        dingy slum dwellings and quickly disappears into the morning
        sky.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Han climbs into the pilot's chair next to Chewbacca, who
        chatters away as he points to something on the radar scope.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- PLANET TATOOINE.

        The Corellian pirateship zooms from Tatooine into space.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Han frantically types information into the ship's computer.
        Little Artoo appears momentarily at the cockpit doorway, makes
        a few beeping remarks, then scurries away.

HAN: It looks like an Imperial cruiser. Our passengers must be hotter
than I thought. Try and hold them off. Angle the deflector shield
while I make the calculations for the jump to light speed.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- PLANET TATOOINE.

        The Millennium Falcon pirateship races away from the yellow
        planet, Tatooine. It is followed by two huge Imperial
        stardestroyers.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Over the shoulders of Chewbacca and Han, we can see the galaxy
        spread before them. Luke and Ben make their way into the
        cramped cockpit where Han continues his calculation.

HAN: Stay sharp! There are two more coming in; they're going to try to
cut us off.

LUKE: Why don't you outrun them? I thought you said this thing was
fast.

HAN: Watch your mouth, kid, or you're going to find yourself floating
home. We'll be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace.
Besides, I know a few maneuvers. We'll lose them!

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- PLANET TATOOINE.

        Imperial cruisers fire at the pirateship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        The ship shudders as an explosion flashes outside the window.

HAN: Here's where the fun begins!

BEN: How long before you can make the jump to light speed?

HAN: It'll take a few moments to get the coordinates from the
navi-computer.

        The ship begins to rock violently as lasers hit it.

LUKE: Are you kidding? At the rate they're gaining...

HAN: Traveling through hyperspace isn't like dusting crops, boy!
Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or
bounce too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick,
wouldn't it?

           The ship is now constantly battered with laserfire as a red
        warning light begins to flash.

LUKE: What's that flashing?

HAN: We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself in, I'm
going to make the jump to light speed.

           The galaxy brightens and they move faster, almost as if
        crashing a barrier. Stars become streaks as the pirateship
        makes the jump to hyperspace.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The Millennium Falcon zooms into infinity in less than a
        second.

EXTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Alderaan looms behind the Death Star battlestation.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONTROL ROOM.

        Admiral Motti enters the quiet control room and bows before
        Governor Tarkin, who stands before the huge wall screen
        displaying a small green planet.

MOTTI: We've entered the Alderaan system.

           Vader and two stormtroopers enter with Princess Leia. Her
        hands are bound.

LEIA: Governor Tarkin, I should have expected to find you holding
Vader's leash. I recognized your foul stench when I was brought on
board.

TARKIN: Charming to the last. You don't know how hard I found it
signing the order to terminate your life!

LEIA: I surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility
yourself!

TARKIN: Princess Leia, before your execution I would like you to be my
guest at a ceremony that will make this battle station operational. No
star system will dare oppose the Emperor now.

LEIA: The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems
will slip through your fingers.

TARKIN: Not after we demonstrate the power of this station. In a way,
you have determined the choice of the planet that'll be destroyed
first. Since you are reluctant to provide us with the location of the
Rebel base, I have chosen to test this station's destructive power...
on your home planet of Alderaan.

LEIA: No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't
possibly...

TARKIN: You would prefer another target? A military target? Then name
the system!

           Tarkin waves menacingly toward Leia.

TARKIN: I grow tired of asking this. So it'll be the last time. Where
is the Rebel base?

           Leia overhears an intercom voice announcing the approach to
        Alderaan.

LEIA: (softly) Dantooine.

           Leia lowers her head.

LEIA: They're on Dantooine.

TARKIN: There. You see Lord Vader, she can be reasonable. (addressing
Motti) Continue with the operation. You may fire when ready.

LEIA: What?

TARKIN: You're far too trusting. Dantooine is too remote to make an
effective demonstration. But don't worry. We will deal with your Rebel
friends soon enough. 

LEIA: No!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- BLAST CHAMBER.

VADER: Commence primary ignition.

           A button is pressed which switches on a panel of lights. A
        hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever.
        Another lever is pulled. Vader reaches for still another lever
        and a bank of lights on a panel and wall light up. A huge beam
        of light emanates from within a cone-shaped area and converges
        into a single laser beam out toward Alderaan. The small green
        planet of Alderaan is blown into space dust.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- CENTRAL HOLD AREA.

        Ben watches Luke practice the lightsaber with a small "seeker"
        robot. Ben suddenly turns away and sits down. He falters,
        seems almost faint.

LUKE: Are you all right? What's wrong?

BEN: I felt a great disturbance in the Force...as if millions of
voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced. I fear
something terrible has happened.

           Ben rubs his forehead. He seems to drift into a trance. Then
        he fixes his gaze on Luke.

BEN: You'd better get on with your exercises.

           Han Solo enters the room.

HAN: Well, you can forget your troubles with those Imperial slugs. I
told you I'd outrun 'em.

           Luke is once again practicing with the lightsaber.

HAN: Don't everyone thank me at once.

           Threepio watches Chewbacca and Artoo who are engrossed in a
        game in which three-dimensional holographic figures move along
        a chess-type board.

HAN: Anyway, we should be at Alderaan about oh-two-hundred hours.

           Chewbacca and the two robots sit around the lighted table
        covered with small holographic monsters. Each side of the
        table has a small computer monitor embedded in it. Chewbacca
        seems very pleased with himself as he rests his lanky fur-
        covered arms over his head.

THREEPIO: Now be careful, Artoo.

           Artoo immediately reaches up and taps the computer with his
        stubby claw hand, causing one of the holographic creatures to
        walk to the new square. A sudden frown crosses Chewbacca's
        face and he begins yelling gibberish at the tiny robot.
        Threepio intercedes on behalf of his small companion and
        begins to argue with the huge Wookiee.

THREEPIO: He made a fair move. Screaming about it won't help you.

HAN: (interrupting) Let him have it. It's not wise to upset a Wookiee.

THREEPIO: But sir, nobody worries about upsetting a droid.

HAN: That's 'cause droids don't pull people's arms out of their socket
when they lose. Wookiees are known to do that.

THREEPIO: I see your point, sir. I suggest a new strategy, Artoo. Let
the Wookiee win.

           Luke stands in the middle of the small hold area; he seems
        frozen in place. A humming lightsaber is held high over his
        head. Ben watches him from the corner, studying his movements.
        Han watches with a bit of smugness.

BEN: Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.

LUKE: You mean it controls your actions?

BEN: Partially. But it also obeys your commands.

           Suspended at eye level, about ten feet in front of Luke, a
        "seeker", a chrome baseball-like robot covered with antennae,
        hovers slowly in a wide arc. The ball floats to one side of
        the youth then the other. Suddenly it makes a lightning-swift
        lunge and stops within a few feet of Luke's face. Luke doesn't
        move and the ball backs off. It slowly moves behind the boy,
        then makes another quick lunge, this time emitting a blood red
        laser beam as it attacks. It hits Luke in the leg causing him
        to tumble over. Han lets loose with a burst of laughter.

HAN: Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good
blaster at your side, kid.

LUKE: You don't believe in the Force, do you?

HAN: Kid, I've flown from one side of this galaxy to the other. I've
seen a lot of strange stuff, but I've never seen anything to make me
believe there's one all-powerful force controlling everything. There's
no mystical energy field that controls my destiny.

           Ben smiles quietly

HAN: It's all a lot of simple tricks and nonsense.

BEN: I suggest you try it again, Luke.

           Ben places a large helmet on Luke's head which covers his
        eyes.

BEN: This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct.

LUKE: (laughing) With the blast shield down, I can't even see. How am
I supposed to fight?

BEN: Your eyes can deceive you. Don't trust them.

           Han skeptically shakes his head as Ben throws the seeker
        into the air. The ball shoots straight up in the air, then
        drops like a rock. Luke swings the lightsaber around blindly
        missing the seeker, which fires off a laserbolt which hits
        Luke square on the seat of the pants. He lets out a painful
        yell and attempts to hit the seeker.

BEN: Stretch out with your feelings.

           Luke stands in one place, seemingly frozen. The seeker
        makes a dive at Luke and, incredibly, he managed to deflect
        the bolt. The ball ceases fire and moves back to its original
        position.

BEN: You see, you can do it.

HAN: I call it luck. 

BEN: In my experience, there's no such thing as luck.

HAN: Look, going good against remotes is one thing. Going good against
the living? That's something else.

           Solo notices a small light flashing on the far side of the
        control panel.

HAN: Looks like we're coming up on Alderaan.

           Han and Chewbacca head back to the cockpit.

LUKE: You know, I did feel something. I could almost see the remote.

BEN: That's good. You have taken your first step into a larger world.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONFERENCE ROOM.

        Imperial Officer Cass stands before Governor Tarkin and the
        evil Dark Lord Darth Vader.

TARKIN: Yes.

OFFICER CASS: Our scout ships have reached Dantooine. They found the
remains of a Rebel base, but they estimate that it has been deserted
for some time. They are now conducting an extensive search of the
surrounding systems.

TARKIN: She lied! She lied to us!

VADER: I told you she would never consciously betray the Rebellion.

TARKIN: Terminate her...immediately!

EXTERIOR: HYPERSPACE.

        The pirateship is just coming out of hyperspace; a strange
        surreal light show surrounds the ship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

HAN: Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines.

           Han pulls back on a control lever. Outside the cockpit
        window stars begin streaking past, seem to decrease in speed,
        then stop. Suddenly the starship begins to shudder and
        violently shake about. Asteroids begin to race toward them,
        battering the sides of the ship.

HAN: What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor
shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the
charts.

           The Wookiee flips off several controls and seems very cool
        in the emergency. Luke makes his way into the bouncing
        cockpit.

LUKE: What's going on?

HAN: Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan!

LUKE: What do you mean? Where is it?

HAN: Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been
totally blown away.

LUKE: What? How?

           Ben moves into the cockpit behind Luke as the ship begins
        to settle down.

BEN: Destroyed...by the Empire!

HAN: The entire starfleet couldn't destroy the whole planet. It'd take
a thousand ships with more fire power than I've...

           A signal starts flashing on the control panel and a muffled
        alarm starts humming.

HAN: There's another ship coming in.

LUKE: Maybe they know what happened.

BEN: It's an Imperial fighter.

           Chewbacca barks his concern. A huge explosion bursts
        outside the cockpit window, shaking the ship violently. A
        tiny, finned Imperial TIE fighter races past the cockpit
        window.

LUKE: It followed us!

BEN: No. It's a short range fighter.

HAN: There aren't any bases around here. Where did it come from?

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The fighter races past the Corellian pirateship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

LUKE: It sure is leaving in a big hurry. If they identify us, we're in
big trouble.

HAN: Not if I can help it. Chewie...jam it's transmissions.

BEN: It'd be as well to let it go. It's too far out of range.

HAN: Not for long...

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The pirateship zooms over the camera and away into the
        vastness of space after the Imperial TIE fighter.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        The tension mounts as the pirateship gains on the tiny fighter.
        In the distance, one of the stars becomes brighter until it is
        obvious that the TIE ship is heading for it. Ben stands behind
        Chewbacca.

BEN: A fighter that size couldn't get this deep into space on its own.

LUKE It must have gotten lost, been part of a convoy or something.

HAN: Well, he ain't going to be around long enough to tell anyone
about us.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The TIE fighter is losing ground to the larger pirateship as
        they race toward camera and disappear over head.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        The distant star can be distinguished as a small moon or
        planet.

LUKE: Look at him. He's headed for that small moon.

HAN: I think I can get him before he gets there...he's almost in
range.

           The small moon begins to take on the appearance of a
        monstrous spherical battle station.

BEN: That's no moon! It's a space station.

HAN: It's too big to be a space station.

LUKE: I have a very bad feeling about this.

BEN: Yeah, I think your right. Full reverse! Chewie, lock in the
auxiliary power.

           The pirateship shudders and the TIE fighter accelerates
        away toward the gargantuan battle station.

LUKE: Why are we still moving towards it?

HAN: We're caught in a tractor beam! It's pulling us in!

LUKE: But there's gotta be something you can do!

HAN: There's nothin' I can do about it, kid. I'm in full power. I'm
going to have to shut down. But they're not going to get me without a
fight!

           Ben Kenobi puts a hand on his shoulder.

BEN: You can't win. But there are alternatives to fighting.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- DEATH STAR.

        As the battered pirate starship is towed closer to the awesome
        metal moon, the immense size of the massive battle station
        becomes staggering. Running along the equator of the gigantic
        sphere is a mile-high band of huge docking ports into which
        the helpless pirateship is dragged.

EXTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- HUGE PORT DOORS.

        The helpless Millennium Falcon is pulled past a docking port
        control room and huge laser turret cannons.

VOICE OVER DEATH STAR INTERCOM: Clear Bay twenty-three-seven. We are
opening the magnetic field.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- DOCKING BAY 2037.

        The pirateship is pulled in through port doors of the Death
        Star, coming to rest in a huge hangar. Thirty stormtroopers
        stand at attention in a central assembly area.

OFFICER: To you stations!

OFFICER: (to another officer) Come with me.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- HALLWAY.

        Stormtroopers run to their posts.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- HANGAR 2037.

        A line of stormtroopers march toward the pirateship in
        readiness to board it, while other troopers stand with weapons
        ready to fire.

OFFICER: Close all outboard shields! Close all outboard shields!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONFERENCE ROOM.
 
        Tarkin pushes a button and responds to the intercom buzz.

TARKIN: Yes.

VOICE: (over intercom) We've captured a freighter entering the remains
of the Alderaan system. It's markings match those of a ship that
blasted its way out of Mos Eisley.

VADER: They must be trying to return the stolen plans to the princess.
She may yet be of some use to us.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- DOCKING BAY 2037.

        Vader and a commander approach the troops as an Officer and
        several heavily armed troops exit the spacecraft.

VOICE: (over intercom) Unlock one-five-seven and nine. Release
charges.

OFFICER: (to Vader) There's no one on board, sir. According to the
log, the crew abandoned ship right after takeoff. It must be a decoy,
sir. Several of the escape pods have been jettisoned.

VADER: Did you find any droids?

OFFICER: No, sir. If there were any on board, they must also have
jettisoned.

VADER: Send a scanning crew on board. I want every part of this ship
checked.

OFFICER: Yes, sir.

VADER: I sense something...a presence I haven't felt since...

           Vader turns quickly and exits the hangar.

OFFICER: Get me a scanning crew in here on the double. I want every
part of this ship checked!

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- HALLWAY.

        A trooper runs through the hallway heading for the exit. In a
        few moments all is quiet. The muffled sounds of a distant
        officer giving orders finally fade. Two floor panels suddenly
        pop up revealing Han Solo and Luke. Ben Kenobi sticks his head
        out of a third locker.

LUKE: Boy, it's lucky you had these compartments.

HAN: I use them for smuggling. I never thought I'd be smuggling myself
in them. This is ridiculous. Even if I could take off, I'd never get
past the tractor beam.

BEN: Leave that to me!

HAN: Damn fool. I knew that you were going to say that!

BEN: Who's the more foolish...the fool or the fool who follows him?

           Han shakes his head, muttering to himself. Chewbacca
        agrees.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY.

        The crewmen carry a heavy box on board the ship, past the two
        stormtroopers guarding either side of the ramp.

TROOPER: The ship's all yours. If the scanners pick up anything,
report it immediately. All right, let's go.

           The crewmen enter the pirateship and a loud crashing sound
        is followed by a voice calling to the guard below.

HAN'S VOICE: Hey down there, could you give us a hand with this?

           The stormtroopers enter the ship and a quick round of
        gunfire is heard.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- FORWARD BAY -- COMMAND OFFICE.

        In a very small command office near the entrance to the
        pirateship, a Gantry Officer looks out his window and notices
        the guards are missing. He speaks into the comlink.

GANTRY OFFICER: TX-four-one-two. Why aren't you at your post?
TX-four-one-two, do you copy? 

           A stormtrooper comes down the ramp of the pirateship and
        waves to the gantry officer, pointing to his ear indicating
        his comlink is not working. The gantry officer shakes his head
        in disgust and heads for the door, giving his aide an annoyed
        look.

GANTRY OFFICER: Take over. We've got a bad transmitter. I'll see what
I can do.

           As the officer approaches the door, it slides open
        revealing the towering Chewbacca. The gantry officer, in a
        momentary state of shock, stumbles backward. With a bone-
        chilling howl, the giant Wookiee flattens the officer with one
        blow. The aide immediately reaches for his pistol, but is
        blasted by Han, dressed as an Imperial stormtrooper. Ben and
        the robots enter the room quickly followed by Luke, also
        dressed as a stormtrooper. Luke quickly removes his helmet.

LUKE: You know, between his howling and your blasting everything in
sight, it's a wonder the whole station doesn't know we're here.

HAN: Bring them on! I prefer a straight fight to all this sneaking
around.

THREEPIO: We found the computer outlet, sir.

           Ben feeds some information into the computer and a map of
        the city appears on the monitor. He begins to inspect it
        carefully. Threepio and Artoo look over the control panel.
        Artoo finds something that makes him whistle wildly.

BEN: Plug in. He should be able to interpret the entire Imperial
computer network.

           Artoo punches his claw arm into the computer socket and the
        vast Imperial brain network comes to life, feeding information
        to the little robot. After a few moments, he beeps something.

THREEPIO: He says he's found the main computer to power the tractor
beam that's holding the ship here. He'll try to make the precise
location appear on the monitor.

           The computer monitor flashes readouts.

THREEPIO: The tractor beam is coupled to the main reactor in seven
locations. A power loss at one of the terminals will allow the ship to
leave.

           Ben studies the data on the monitor readout.

BEN: I don't think you boys can help. I must go alone.

HAN: Whatever you say. I've done more that I bargained for on this
trip already.

LUKE I want to go with you.

BEN: Be patient, Luke. Stay and watch over the droids.

LUKE: But he can...

BEN: They must be delivered safely or other star systems will suffer
the same fate as Alderaan. Your destiny lies along a different path
than mine. The Force will be with you...always!

           Ben adjusts the lightsaber on his belt and silently steps
        out of the command office, then disappears down a long grey
        hallway. Chewbacca barks a comment and Han shakes his head in
        agreement.

HAN: Boy you said it, Chewie.

           Han looks at Luke.

HAN: Where did you dig up that old fossil?

LUKE: Ben is a great man.

HAN: Yeah, great at getting us into trouble.

LUKE: I didn't hear you give any ideas...

HAN: Well, anything would be better than just hanging around waiting
for him to pick us up...

LUKE: Who do you think...

           Suddenly Artoo begins to whistle and beep a blue streak.
        Luke goes over to him.

LUKE: What is it?

THREEPIO: I'm afraid I'm not quite sure, sir. He says "I found her",
and keeps repeating, "She's here."

LUKE: Well, who...who has he found?

           Artoo whistles a frantic reply.

THREEPIO: Princess Leia.

LUKE: The princess? She's here?

HAN: Princess? What's going on?

THREEPIO: Level five. Detention block A A-twenty-three. I'm afraid
she's scheduled to be terminated.

LUKE: Oh, no! We've got to do something.

HAN: What are you talking about?

LUKE: The droid belongs to her. She's the one in the message.. We've
got to help her.

HAN: Now, look, don't get any funny ideas. The old man wants us to
wait right here.

LUKE: But he didn't know she was here. Look, will you just find a way
back into the detention block?

HAN: I'm not going anywhere.

LUKE: They're going to execute her. Look, a few minutes ago you said
you didn't want to just wait here to be captured. Now all you want to
do is stay. 

HAN: Marching into the detention area is not what I had in mind.

LUKE: But they're going to kill her!

HAN: Better her than me...

LUKE: She's rich.

           Chewbacca growls.

HAN: Rich?

LUKE: Yes. Rich, powerful! Listen, if you were to rescue her, the
reward would be...

HAN: What?

LUKE: Well more wealth that you can imagine.

HAN: I don't know, I can imagine quite a bit!

LUKE: You'll get it!

HAN: I better!

LUKE: You will...

HAN: All right, kid. But you'd better be right about this.

           Han looks at Chewie, who grunts a short grunt.

LUKE: All right.

HAN: What's your plan?

LUKE: Uh...Threepio, hand me those binders there will you?

           Luke moves toward Chewbacca with electronic cuffs.

LUKE: Okay. Now, I'm going to put these on you.

           Chewie lets out a hideous growl.

LUKE: Okay. Han, you put these on.

           Luke sheepishly hands the binders to Han.

HAN: Don't worry, Chewie. I think I know what he has in mind.

           The Wookiee has a worried and frightened look on his face
        as Han binds him with the electronic cuffs.

THREEPIO: Master Luke, sir! Pardon me for asking...but, ah...what
should Artoo and I do if we're discovered here?

LUKE: Lock the door!

HAN: And hope they don't have blasters.

THREEPIO: That isn't very reassuring.

           Luke and Han put on their armored stormtrooper helmets and
        start off into the giant Imperial Death Star.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- DETENTION AREA -- ELEVATOR TUBE.

        Han and Luke try to look inconspicuous in their armored suits
        as they wait for a vacuum elevator to arrive. Troops,
        bureaucrats, and robots bustle about, ignoring the trio
        completely. Only a few give the giant Wookiee a curious
        glance.
           Finally a small elevator arrives and the trio enters.

LUKE: I can't see a thing in this helmet.

        A bureaucrat races to get aboard also, but is signaled away by
        Han. The door to the pod-like vehicle slides closed and the
        elevator car takes off through a vacuum tube.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN HALLWAY.

        Several Imperial officers walk through the wide main
        passageway. They pass several stormtroopers and a robot
        similar to Threepio but with an insect face. At the far end of
        the hallway, a passing flash of Ben Kenobi appears, then
        disappears down a small hallway. His appearance is so fleeting
        that it is hard to tell if he is real or just an illusion. No
        one in the hallway seems to notice him.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- INTERIOR ELEVATOR -- DETENTION SECURITY AREA.

        Luke and Han step forward to exit the elevator, but the door
        slides open behind them. The giant Wookiee and his two guards
        enter the old grey security station. Guards and laser gates
        are everywhere. Han whispers to Luke under his breath.

HAN: This is not going to work.

LUKE: Why didn't you say so before?

HAN: I did say so before!

INTERIOR: DETENTION AREA.

        Elevator doors open. A tall, grim looking Officer approaches
        the trio.

OFFICER: Where are you taking this...thing?

           Chewie growls a bit at the remark but Han nudges him to
        shut up.

LUKE: Prisoner transfer from Block one-one-three-eight.

OFFICER: I wasn't notified. I'll have to clear it.

           The officer goes back to his console and begins to punch in
        the information. There are only three other troopers in the
        area. Luke and Han survey the situation, checking all of the
        alarms, laser gates, and camera eyes. Han unfastens one of
        Chewbacca's electronic cuffs and shrugs to Luke.
           Suddenly Chewbacca throws up his hands and lets out with
        one of his ear-piercing howls. He grabs Han's laser rifle.

HAN: Look out! He's loose!

LUKE: He's going to pull us all apart.

HAN: Go get him!

           The startled guards are momentarily dumbfounded. Luke and
        Han have already pulled out their laser pistols and are
        blasting away at the terrifying Wookiee. Their barrage of
        laserfire misses Chewbacca, but hits the camera eyes, laser
        gate controls, and the Imperial guards. The officer is the
        last of the guards to fall under the laserfire just as he is
        about to push the alarm system. Han rushes to the comlink
        system, which is screeching questions about what is going on.
        He quickly checks the computer readout.

HAN: We've got to find out which cell this princess of yours is in.
Here it is...cell twenty-one-eight-seven. You go get her. I'll hold
them here.

        Luke races down one of the cell corridors. Han speaks into the
        buzzing comlink.

HAN: (sounding official) Everything is under control. Situation
normal.

INTERCOM VOICE: What happened?

HAN: (getting nervous) Uh...had a slight weapons malfunction. But, uh,
everything's perfectly all right now. We're fine. We're all fine here,
now, thank you. How are you?

INTERCOM VOICE: We're sending a squad up.

HAN: Uh, uh, negative. We had a reactor leak here now. Give us a few
minutes to lock it down. Large leak...very dangerous.

INTERCOM VOICE: Who is this? What's your operating number?

           Han blasts the comlink and it explodes.

HAN: Boring conversation anyway. (yelling down the hall) Luke! We're
going to have company!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CELL ROW.

        Luke stops in front of one of the cells and blasts the door
        away with a laser pistol. When the smoke clears, Luke sees the
        dazzling young princess-senator. She had been sleeping and is
        now looking at him with an uncomprehending look on her face.
        Luke is stunned by her incredible beauty and stands staring at
        her with his mouth hanging open.

LEIA: (finally) Aren't you a little short to be a stormtrooper?

           Luke takes off his helmet, coming out of it.

LUKE: What? Oh...the uniform. I'm Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue
you. 

LEIA: You're who?

LUKE: I'm here to rescue you. I've got your R2 unit. I'm here with Ben
Kenobi.

LEIA: Ben Kenobi is here! Where is he?

LUKE: Come on!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONFERENCE ROOM.

        Darth Vader paces the room as Governor Tarkin sits at the far
        end of the conference table.

VADER: He is here...

TARKIN: Obi-Wan Kenobi! What makes you think so?

VADER: A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the
presence of my old master.

TARKIN: Surely he must be dead by now.

VADER: Don't underestimate the power of the Force.

TARKIN: The Jedi are extinct, their fire has gone out of the universe.
You, my friend, are all that's left of their religion.

           There is a quiet buzz on the comlink.

TARKIN: Yes.

INTERCOM VOICE: Governor Tarkin, we have an emergency alert in
detention block A A-twenty-three.

TARKIN: The princess! Put all sections on alert!

VADER: Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.

TARKIN: If you're right, he must not be allowed to escape.

VADER: Escape is not his plan. I must face him alone.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- DETENTION AREA -- HALLWAY.

        An ominous buzzing sound is heard on the other side of the
        elevator door.

HAN: Chewie!

        Chewbacca responds with a growling noise.

HAN: Get behind me! Get behind me!

           A series of explosions knock a hole in the elevator door
        through which several Imperial troops begin to emerge.
           Han and Chewie fire laser pistols at them through the smoke
        and flame. They turn and run down the cell hallway, meeting up
        with Luke and Leia rushing toward them.

HAN: Can't get out that way.

LEIA: Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route.

HAN: (sarcastically) Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your
Highness.

           Luke takes a small comlink transmitter from his belt as
        they continue to exchange fire with stormtroopers making their
        way down the corridor.

LUKE: See-Threepio! See-Threepio!

THREEPIO: (over comlink) Yes sir?

LUKE: We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell
bay?...What was that? I didn't copy!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN BAY GANTRY -- CONTROL TOWER.

        Threepio paces the control center as little Artoo beeps and
        whistles a blue streak. Threepio yells into the small comlink
        transmitter.

THREEPIO: I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir.
The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out; all other
information on your level is restricted.

           Someone begins banging on the door.

TROOPER VOICE: Open up in there!

THREEPIO: Oh, no!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- DETENTION CORRIDOR.

        Luke and Leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as
        they continue to exchange fire with troops. Han and Chewbacca
        are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far
        and of the hallway. The laserfire is very intense, and smoke
        fills the narrow cell corridor.

LUKE: There isn't any other way out.

HAN: I can't hold them off forever! Now what?

LEIA: This is some rescue. When you came in here, didn't you have a
plan for getting out?

HAN: (pointing to Luke) He's the brains, sweetheart.

           Luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.

LUKE: Well, I didn't...

           The princess grabs Luke's gun and fires at a small grate in
        the wall next to Han, almost frying him.

HAN: What the hell are you doing?

LEIA: Somebody has to save our skins. Into the garbage chute, wise
guy.

           She jumps through the narrow opening as Han and Chewbacca
        look on in amazement. Chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and
        says something.

HAN: Get in there you big furry oaf! I don't care what you smell! Get
in there and don't worry about it.

           Han gives him a kick and the Wookiee disappears into the
        tiny opening. Luke and Han continue firing as they work their
        way toward the opening.

HAN: Wonderful girl! Either I'm going to kill her or I'm beginning to
like her. Get in there!

           Luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. Han
        fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover,
        then slides into the chute himself and is gone.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.

        Han tumbles into the large room filled with garbage and muck.
        Luke is already stumbling around looking for an exit. He finds
        a small hatchway and struggles to get it open. It won't budge.

HAN: (sarcastically) Oh! The garbage chute was a really wonderful
idea. What an incredible smell you've discovered! Let's get out of
here! Get away from there...

LUKE: No! wait!

           Han draws his laser pistol and fires at the hatch. The
        laserbolt ricochets wildly around the small metal room.
        Everyone dives for cover in the garbage as the bolt explodes
        almost on top of them. Leia climbs out of the garbage with a
        rather grim look on her face.

LUKE: Will you forget it? I already tried it. It's magnetically
sealed!

LEIA: Put that thing away! You're going to get us all killed.

HAN: Absolutely, Your Worship. Look, I had everything under control
until you led us down here. You know, it's not going to take them long
to figure out what happened to us.

LEIA: It could be worst...

           A loud, horrible, inhuman moan works its way up from the
        murky depths. Chewbacca lets out a terrified howl and begins
        to back away. Han and Luke stand fast with their laser pistols
        drawn. The Wookiee is cowering near one of the walls.

HAN: It's worst.

LUKE: There's something alive in here!

HAN: That's your imagination.

LUKE: Something just moves past my leg! Look! Did you see that?

HAN: What?

LUKE: Help!

           Suddenly Luke is yanked under the garbage.

HAN: Luke! Luke! Luke!

           Solo tries to get to Luke. Luke surfaces with a gasp of air
        and thrashing of limbs. A membrane tentacle is wrapped around
        his throat.

LEIA: Luke!

           Leia extends a long pipe toward him.

LEIA: Luke, Luke, grab a hold of this.

LUKE: Blast it, will you! My gun's jammed.

HAN: Where?

LUKE: Anywhere! Oh!!

           Solo fires his gun downward. Luke is pulled back into the
        muck by the slimy tentacle.

HAN: Luke! Luke!

           Suddenly the walls of the garbage receptacle shudder and
        move in a couple of inches. Then everything is deathly quiet.
        Han and Leia give each other a worried look as Chewbacca howls
        in the corner. With a rush of bubbles and muck Luke suddenly
        bobs to the surface.

LEIA: Grab him!

           Luke seems to be released by the thing.

LEIA: What happened?

LUKE: I don't know, it just let go of me and disappeared...

HAN: I've got a very bad feeling about this.

           Before anyone can say anything the walls begin to rumble
        and edge toward the Rebels.

LUKE: The walls are moving!

LEIA: Don't just stand there. Try to brace it with something.

           They place poles and long metal beams between the closing
        walls, but they are simply snapped and bent as the giant
        trashmasher rumbles on. The situation doesn't look too good.

LUKE: Wait a minute!

           Luke pulls out his comlink.

LUKE: Threepio! Come in Threepio! Threepio! Where could he be?

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN GANTRY -- COMMAND OFFICE.

        A soft buzzer and the muted voice of Luke calling out for
        See-Threepio can be heard on Threepio's hand comlink, which is
        sitting on the deserted computer console. Artoo and Threepio
        are nowhere in sight. Suddenly there is a great explosion and
        the door of the control tower flies across the floor. Four
        armed stormtroopers enter the chamber.

FIRST TROOPER: Take over! (pointing to the dead officer) See to him!
Look there!

           A trooper pushes a button and the supply cabinet door
        slides open. See-Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are inside. Artoo
        follows his bronze companion out into the office.

THREEPIO: They're madmen! They're heading for the prison level. If you
hurry, you might catch them.

FIRST OFFICER: (to his troops) Follow me! You stand guard.

           The troops hustle off down the hallway, leaving a guard to
        watch over the command office.

THREEPIO: (to Artoo) Come on!

           The guard aims a blaster at them.

THREEPIO: Oh! All this excitement has overrun the circuits of my
counterpart here. If you don't mind, I'd like to take him down to
maintenance.

TROOPER: All right.

           The guard nods and Threepio, with little Artoo in tow,
        hurries out the door.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.

        As the walls rumble closed, the room gets smaller and smaller.
Chewie is whining and trying to hold a wall back with his giant paws.
Han is leaning back against the other wall. Garbage is snapping and
popping. Luke is trying to reach Threepio.

LUKE: Threepio! Come in, Threepio! Threepio!

           Han and Leia try to brace the contracting walls with a
        pole. Leia begins to sink into the trash.

HAN: Get to the top!

LEIA: I can't 

LUKE: Where could he be? Threepio! Threepio, will you come in?

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY -- SERVICE PANEL.

THREEPIO: They aren't here! Something must have happened to them. See
if they've been captured.

           Little Artoo carefully plugs his claw arm into a new wall
        socket and a complex array of electronic sounds spew from the
        tiny robot.

THREEPIO: Hurry!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.

        The walls are only feet apart. Leia and Han are braced against
        the walls. The princess is frightened. They look at each
        other. Leia reaches out and takes Han's hand and she holds it
        tightly. She's terrified and suddenly groans as she feels the
        first crushing pressure against her body.

HAN: One thing's for sure. We're all going to be a lot thinner! (to
Leia) Get on top of it!

LEIA: I'm trying!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY -- SERVICE PANEL.

THREEPIO: (to Artoo) Thank goodness, they haven't found them! Where
could they be?
        
           Artoo frantically beeps something to See-Threepio.

THREEPIO: Use the comlink? Oh, my! I forgot I turned it off!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.

        Meanwhile, Luke is lying on his side, trying to keep his head
        above the rising ooze. Luke's comlink begins to buzz and he
        rips it off his belt.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY -- SERVICE PANEL.

        Muffled sounds of Luke's voice over the comlink can be heard,
        but not distinctly.

THREEPIO: Are you there, sir?

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.

LUKE: Threepio!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY -- SERVICE PANEL.

THREEPIO: We've had some problems...

LUKE: (over comlink) Will you shut up and listen to me? Shut down all
garbage mashers on the detention level, will you? Do you copy?

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.

LUKE: Shut down all the garbage mashers on the detention level.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY -- SERVICE PANEL.

LUKE: (over comlink) Shut down all the garbage mashers on the
detention level.

THREEPIO: (to Artoo) No. Shut them all down! Hurry!

           Threepio holds his head in agony as he hears the incredible
        screaming and hollering from Luke's comlink.

THREEPIO: Listen to them! They're dying, Artoo! Curse my metal body! I
wasn't fast enough. It's all my fault! My poor master!

LUKE: (over comlink) Threepio, we're all right!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- GARBAGE ROOM.

        The screaming and hollering is the sound of joyous relief. The
        walls have stopped moving. Han, Chewie and Leia embrace in the
        background.

LUKE: We're all right. You did great.

           Luke moves to the pressure sensitive hatch, looking for a
        number.

LUKE: Hey...hey, open the pressure maintenance hatch on unit number...
where are we?

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY -- SERVICE PANEL.

HAN: (over comlink) Three-two-six-eight-two-seven.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- TRACTOR BEAM -- POWER GENERATOR TRENCH.

        Ben enters a humming service trench that powers the huge
        tractor beam. The trench seems to be a hundred miles deep. The
        clacking sound of huge switching devices can be heard. The old
        Jedi edges his his way along a narrow ledge leading to a
        control panel that connects two large cables. He carefully
        makes several adjustments in the computer terminal, and
        several lights on the board go from red to blue.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- UNUSED HALLWAY.

        The group exits the garbage room into a dusty, unused hallway.
        Han and Luke remove the trooper suits and strap on the blaster
        belts.

HAN: If we can just avoid any more female advice, we ought to be able
to get out of here.

           Luke smiles and scratches his head as he takes a blaster
        from Solo.

LUKE: Well, let's get moving!

           Chewie begins growling and points to the hatch to the
        garbage room, as he runs away and then stops howling.

HAN: (to Chewie) Where are you going?

           The Dia Nogu bangs against the hatch and a long, slimy
        tentacle works its way out of the doorway searching for a
        victim. Han aims his pistol.

LEIA: No, wait. They'll hear!

           Han fires at the doorway. The noise of the blast echoes
        relentlessly throughout the empty passageway. Luke simply
        shakes his head in disgust.

HAN: (to Chewie) Come here, you big coward!

           Chewie shakes his head "no."

HAN: Chewie! Come here!

LEIA: Listen. I don't know who you are, or where you came from, but
from now on, you do as I tell you. Okay?

           Han is stunned at the command of the petite young girl.

HAN: Look, Your Worshipfulness, let's get one thing straight! I take
orders from one person! Me!

LEIA: It's a wonder you're still alive. (looking at Chewie) Will
somebody get this big walking carpet out of my way?

           Han watches her start away. He looks at Luke.

HAN: No reward is worth this.

           They follow her, moving swiftly down the deserted corridor.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- POWER TRENCH.

        Suddenly a door behind Ben slides open and a detachment of
        stormtroopers marches to the power trench. Ben instantly slips
        into the shadows as an Officer moves to within a few feet of
        him.

OFFICER: Secure this area until the alert is canceled.

FIRST TROOPER: Give me regular reports.

           All but two of the stormtroopers leave.

FIRST TROOPER: Do you know what's going on?

SECOND TROOPER: Maybe it's another drill.

           Ben moves around the tractor beam, watching the
        stormtroopers as they turn their backs to him. Ben gestures
        with his hand toward them, as the troops think they hear
        something in the other hallway. With the help of the Force,
        Ben deftly slips past the troopers and into the main hallway.

SECOND TROOPER: What was that?

FIRST TROOPER: Oh, it's nothing. Don't worry about it.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- HALLWAY.

        Luke, Han, Chewbacca, and Leia run down an empty hallway and
        stop before a bay window overlooking the pirateship. Troopers
        are milling about the ship. Luke takes out his pocket comlink.

HAN: (looking at his ship) There she is.

LUKE: See-Threepio, do you copy?

THREEPIO: (voice) For the moment. Uh, we're in the main hangar across
from the ship.

LUKE: We're right above you. Stand by.

           Han is watching the dozen or so troops moving in and out of
        the pirateship. Leia moves towards Han, touches his arm and
        points out the window to the ship.

LEIA: You came in that thing? You're braver that I thought.

HAN: Nice! Come on!

           Han gives her a dirty look, and they start off down the
        hallway. They round a corner and run right into twenty
        Imperial stormtroopers heading toward them. Both groups are
        taken by surprise and stop in their tracks.

FIRST TROOPER: It's them! Blast them!

           Before even thinking, Han draws his laser pistol and
        charges the troops, firing. His blaster knocks one of the
        stormtroopers into the air. Chewie follows his captain down
        the corridor, stepping over the fallen trooper on the floor.

HAN: (to Luke and Leia) Get back to the ship!

LUKE: Where are you going? Come back!

           Han has already rounded a corner and does not hear.

LEIA: He certainly has courage.

LUKE: What good will it do us if he gets himself killed? Come on!

           Luke is furious but doesn't have time to think about it for
        muted alarms begin to go off down on the hangar deck. Luke and
        Leia start off toward the starship hangar.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- SUBHALLWAY.

        Han chases the stormtroopers down a long subhallway. He is
        yelling and brandishing his laser pistol. The troops reach a
        dead end and are forced to turn and fight. Han stops a few
        feet from them and assumes a defensive position. The troops
        begin to raise their laser guns. Soon all ten troopers are
        moving into an attack position in front of the lone
        starpirate. Han's determined look begins to fade as the troops
        begin to advance. Solo jumps backward as they fire at him.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- SUBHALLWAY.

        Chewbacca runs down the subhallway in a last-ditch attempt to
        save his bold captain. Suddenly he hears the firing of laser
        guns and yelling. Around the corner shoots Han, pirate
        extraordinaire, running for his life, followed by a host of
        furious stormtroopers. Chewbacca turns and starts running the
        other way also.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- SUBHALLWAY.

        Luke fires his laser pistol wildly as he and Leia rush down a
        narrow subhallway, chased by several stormtroopers. They
        quickly reach the end of the subhallway and race through an
        open hatchway.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CENTRAL CORE SHAFT.

        Luke and Leia race through the hatch onto a narrow bridge that
        spans a huge, deep shaft that seems to go into infinity. The
        bridge has been retracted into the wall of the shaft, and Luke
        almost rushes into the abyss. He loses his balance off the end
        of the bridge as Leia, behind him, takes hold of his arm and
        pulls him back.

LUKE: (gasping) I think we took a wrong turn.

           Blasts from the stormtroopers' laser guns explode nearby
        reminding them of the oncoming danger. Luke fires back at the
        advancing troops. Leia reaches over and hits a switch that
        pops the hatch door shut with a resounding boom, leaving them
        precariously perched on a short piece of bridge overhang.
        Laserfire from the troopers continues to hit the steel door.

LEIA: There's no lock!

           Luke blasts the controls with his laser pistol.

LUKE: That oughta hold it for a while.

LEIA: Quick, we've got to get across. Find the control that extends
the bridge.

LUKE: Oh, I think I just blasted it.

           Luke looks at the blasted bridge control while the
        stormtroopers on the opposite side of the door begin making
        ominous drilling and pounding sounds.

LEIA: They're coming through!

           Luke notices something on his stormtrooper belt, when
        laserfire hits the wall behind him. Luke aims his laser pistol
        at a stormtrooper perched on a higher bridge overhang across
        the abyss from them. They exchange fire. Two more troops
        appear on another overhang, also firing. A trooper is hit, and
        grabs at his chest.
           Another trooper standing on the bridge overhang is hit by
        Luke's laserfire, and plummets down the shaft. Troopers move
        back off the bridge; Luke hands the gun to Leia.

LUKE: Here, hold this.

           Luke pulls a thin nylon cable from his trooper utility
        belt. It has a grappler hook on it. A trooper appears on a
        bridge overhang and fires at Luke and Leia. As Luke works with
        the rope, Leia returns the laser volley. Another trooper
        appears and fires at them, as Leia returns his fire as well.
        Suddenly, the hatch door begins to open, revealing the feet of
        more troops.

LEIA: Here they come!

           Leia hits one of the stormtroopers on the bridge above, and
        he falls into the abyss. Luke tosses the rope across the gorge
        and it wraps itself around an outcropping of pipes. He tugs on
        the rope to make sure it is secure, then grabs the princess in
        his arms. Leia looks at Luke, then kisses him quickly on the
        lips. Luke is very surprised.

LEIA: For luck!

           Luke pushes off and they swing across the treacherous abyss
        to the corresponding hatchway on the opposite side. Just as
        Luke and Leia reach the far side of the canyon, the
        stormtroopers break through the hatch and begin to fire at
        the escaping duo. Luke returns the fire before ducking into
        the tiny subhallway.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- NARROW PASSAGEWAY.

        Ben hides in the shadows of the narrow passageway as several
        stormtroopers rush past him in the main hallway. He checks to
        make sure they're gone, then runs down the hallway in the
        opposite direction. Darth Vader appears at the far end of the
        hallway and starts after the old Jedi.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY.

        Threepio looks around at the troops milling about the
        pirateship entry ramp.

THREEPIO: Where could they be?

           Artoo, plugged into the computer socket, turns his dome
        left and right, beeping a response.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CORRIDOR -- BLAST SHIELDS DOOR.

        Han and Chewbacca run down a long corridor with several
        troopers hot on their trail.

TROOPER: Close the blast doors!

           At the end of the hallway, blast doors begin to close in
        front of them. The young starpilot and his furry companion
        race past the huge doors just as they are closing, and manage
        to get off a couple off laserblasts at the pursuing troops
        before the doors slam shut.

TROOPER: Open the blast doors! Open the blast doors!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- HALLWAY LEADING TO MAIN FORWARD BAY.

        Ben hurries along one of the tunnels leading to the hangar
        where the pirateship waits. Just before he reaches the hangar,
        Darth Vader steps into view at the end of the tunnel, not ten
        feet away. Vader lights his saber. Ben also ignites his and
        steps slowly forward.

VADER: I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. We meet again, at last. The
circle is now complete.

           Ben Kenobi moves with elegant ease into a classical
        offensive position. The fearsome Dark Knight takes a defensive
        stance.

VADER: When I left you, I was but the learner; now I am the master.

BEN: Only a master of evil, Darth.

           The two Galactic warriors stand perfectly still for a few
        moments, sizing each other up and waiting for the right
        moment. Ben seems to be under increasing pressure and strain,
        as if an invisible weight were being placed upon him. He
        shakes his head and, blinking, tries to clear his eyes. 
           Ben makes a sudden lunge at the huge warrior but is checked
        by a lightning movement of The Sith. A masterful slash stroke
        by Vader is blocked by the old Jedi. Another of the Jedi's
        blows is blocked, then countered. Ben moves around the Dark
        Lord and starts backing into the massive starship hangar. The
        two powerful warriors stand motionless for a few moments with
        laser swords locked in mid-air, creating a low buzzing sound.

VADER: Your powers are weak, old man.

BEN: You can't win, Darth. If you strike me down, I shall become more
powerful than you can possibly imagine.

           Their lightsabers continue to meet in combat.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- MAIN FORWARD BAY.

        Han Solo and Chewbacca, their weapons in hand, lean back
        against the wall surveying the forward bay, watching the
        Imperial stormtroopers make their rounds of the hangar.

HAN: Didn't we just leave this party?

           Chewbacca growls a reply, as Luke and the princess join
        them.

HAN: What kept you?

LEIA: We ran into some old friends.

LUKE: Is the ship all right?

HAN: Seems okay, if we can get to it. Just hope the old man got the
tractor beam out of commission.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- HALLWAY.

        Vader and Ben Kenobi continue their powerful duel. As they hit
        their lightsabers together, lightning flashes on impact.
        Troopers look on in interest as the old Jedi and Dark Lord of
        The Sith fight. Suddenly Luke spots the battle from his
        group's vantage point.

LUKE: Look!

           Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie look up and see Ben and Vader
        emerging from the hallways on the far side of the docking bay.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- DOCKING BAY.

        Threepio and Artoo-Detoo are in the center of the Death Star's
        Imperial docking bay.

THREEPIO: Come on, Artoo, we're going!

           Threepio ducks out of sight as the seven stormtroopers who
        were guarding the starship rush past them heading towards Ben
        and The Sith Knight. He pulls on Artoo.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- HALLWAY.

        Solo, Chewie, Luke, and Leia tensely watch the duel. The
        troops rush toward the battling knights.

HAN: Now's our chance! Go!

        They start for the Millennium Falcon. Ben sees the troops
        charging toward him and realizes that he is trapped. Vader
        takes advantage of Ben's momentary distraction and brings his
        mighty lightsaber down on the old man. Ben manages to deflect
        the blow and swiftly turns around.
           The old Jedi Knight looks over his shoulder at Luke, lifts
        his sword from Vader's then watches his opponent with a serene
        look on his face.
           Vader brings his sword down, cutting old Ben in half. Ben's
        cloak falls to the floor in two parts, but Ben is not in it.
        Vader is puzzled at Ben's disappearance and pokes at the empty
        cloak. As the guards are distracted, the adventurers and the
        robots reach the starship. Luke sees Ben cut in two and starts
        for him. Aghast, he yells out.

LUKE: No!

           The stormtroopers turn toward Luke and begin firing at him.
        The robots are already moving up the ramp into the Millennium
        Falcon, while Luke, transfixed by anger and awe, returns their
        fire. Solo joins in the laserfire. Vader looks up and advances
        toward them, as one of his troopers is struck down.

HAN: (to Luke) Come on!

LEIA: Come on! Luke, its too late!

HAN: Blast the door! Kid!

           Luke fires his pistol at the door control panel, and it
        explodes. The door begins to slide shut. Three troopers charge
        forward firing laser bolts, as the door slides to a close
        behind them, shutting Vader and the other troops out of the
        docking bay. A stormtrooper lies dead at the feet of his
        onrushing compatriots. Luke starts for the advancing troops,
        as Solo and Leia move up the ramp into the pirateship. He
        fires, hitting a stormtrooper, who crumbles to the floor.

BEN'S VOICE: Run, Luke! Run!

           Luke looks around to see where the voice came from. He
        turns toward the pirateship, ducking Imperial gunfire from the
        troopers and races into the ship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Han pulls back on the controls and the ship begins to move. The
        dull thud of laser bolts bouncing off the outside of the ship
        as Chewie adjusts his controls.

HAN: I hope the old man got that tractor beam out if commission, or
this is going to be a real short trip. Okay, hit it!

           Chewbacca growls in agreement.

EXTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON.

        The Millennium Falcon powers away from the Death Star docking
        bay, makes a spectacular turn and disappears into the vastness
        of space.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- CENTRAL HOLD AREA.

        Luke, saddened by the loss of Obi-Wan Kenobi, stares off
        blankly as the robots look on. Leia puts a blanket around him
        protectively, and Luke turns and looks up at her. She sits
        down beside him.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Solo spots approaching enemy ships.

HAN: (to Chewie) We're coming up on the sentry ships. Hold 'em off!
Angle the deflector shields while I charge up the main guns!

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- CENTRAL HOLD AREA.

        Luke looks downward sadly, shaking his head back and forth, as
        the princess smiles comfortingly at him.

LUKE: I can't believe he's gone.

           Artoo-Detoo beeps a reply.

LEIA: There wasn't anything you could have done.

           Han rushes into the hold area where Luke is sitting with
        the princess.

HAN: (to Luke) Come on, buddy, we're not out of this yet!

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS -- COCKPIT.

        Solo climbs into his attack position in the topside gunport.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- HOLD AREA.

        Luke gets up and moves out toward the gunports as Leia heads
        for the cockpit.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS -- COCKPIT.

        Luke climbs down the ladder into the gunport cockpit, settling
        into one of the two main laser cannons mounted in large
        rotating turrets on either side of the ship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- SOLO'S GUNPORT.

        Han adjusts his headset as he sits before the controls of his
        laser cannon, then speaks into the attached microphone.

HAN: (to Luke) You in, kid? Okay, stay sharp!


INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS -- COCKPIT.

        Chewbacca and Princess Leia search the heavens for attacking
        TIE fighters. The Wookiee pulls back on the speed controls as
        the ship bounces slightly.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- SOLO'S GUNPORT -- COCKPIT.

        Computer graphic readouts form on Solo's target screen, as Han
        reaches for controls.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORT -- COCKPIT.

        Luke sits in readiness for the attack, his hand on the laser
        cannon's control button.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Chewbacca spots the enemy ships and barks.

LEIA: (into intercom) Here they come!

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT -- POV (POINT OF VIEW) -- SPACE.

        The Imperial TIE fighters move towards the Millennium Falcon,
        one each veering off to the left and right of the pirateship.

INTERIOR: TIE FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        The stars whip past behind the Imperial pilot as he adjusts
        his maneuvering joy stick.

EXTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- IN SPACE.

        The TIE fighter races past the Falcon, firing laser beams as
        it passes.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- HOLD AREA.

        Threepio is seated in the hold area, next to Artoo-Detoo. The
        pirateship bounces and vibrates as the power goes out in the
        room and then comes back on.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT -- GUNPORTS.

        A TIE fighter maneuvers in front of Han, who follows it and
        fires at it with the laser cannon. Luke does likewise, as the
        fighter streaks into view. The ship has suffered a minor hit,
        and bounces slightly. 

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        Two TIE fighters dive down toward the pirateship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS.

        Luke fires at an unseen fighter.

LUKE: They're coming in too fast!

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON/TIE FIGHTERS.

        Pan with pirateship as two TIE fighters charge through the
        background. Laserbolts streak from all the craft.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- CHEWBACCA.

        The ship shudders as a laserbolt hits very close to the
        cockpit. The Wookiee chatters something to Leia.

EXTERIOR: TIE FIGHTER -- SPACE.

        Full shot of a TIE fighter as it moves fast through the frame,
        firing on the pirate starship.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- TIE FIGHTERS.

        The two TIE fighters fire a barrage of laserbeams at the
        pirateship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- MAIN PASSAGEWAY.

        A laserbolt streaks into the side of the pirateship. The ship
        lurches violently, throwing poor Threepio into a cabinet fill
        of small computer chips.

THREEPIO: Oooh!

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT -- GUNPORTS.

        Leia watches the computer readout as Chewbacca manipulates the
        ship's controls.

LEIA: We've lost lateral controls.

HAN: Don't worry, she'll hold together.

           An enemy laserbolt hits the pirateship's control panel,
        causing it to blow out in a shower of sparks.

HAN: (to ship) You hear me, baby? Hold together!

           Artoo-Detoo advances toward the smoking sparking control
        panel, dousing the inferno by spraying it with fire retardant
        beeping all the while.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORT.

        Luke swivels in his gun mount, following the TIE fighter with
        his laser cannon.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORT.

        Solo aims his laser cannon at the enemy fighter.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        A TIE fighter streaks in front of the starship.

        Leia watches the TIE fighter ship fly over.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        A TIE fighter heads right for the pirateship, then zooms
        overhead.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS.

        Luke follows the TIE fighter across his field of view, firing
        laserbeams from his cannon.

EXTERIOR: TIE FIGHTER.

        A TIE fighter dives past the pirateship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS.

        Luke fires at a TIE fighter. At his port, Han follows a
        fighter in his sights, releasing a blast of laserfire. He
        connects, and the fighter explodes into fiery dust. Han laughs
        victoriously.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        Two TIE fighters move toward and over the Millennium Falcon,
        unleashing a barrage of laserbolts at the ship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS.

        Another TIE fighter moves in on the pirateship and Luke,
        smiling, fires the laser cannon at it, scoring a spectacular
        direct hit.

LUKE: Got him! I got him!

           Han turns and gives Luke a victory wave which Luke
        gleefully returns.

HAN: Great kid! Don't get cocky.

           Han turns back to his laser cannon.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        Two more TIE fighters cross in front of the pirateship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

        While Chewbacca manipulates the controls, Leia turns, looking
        over her shoulder out the ports.

LEIA: There are still two more of them out there!

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        A TIE fighter moves up over the pirateship, firing laserblasts
        at it.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS.

        Luke and Han look into their respective projected target
        screens. An Imperial fighter crosses Solo's port, and Han
        swivels in his chair, following it with blasts from his laser
        cannon. Another fighter crosses Luke's port, and he reacts in
        a like manner, the glow of his target screen lighting his
        face.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The TIE fighter zooms toward the pirateship, firing
        destructive blasts at it.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORTS.

        Luke fires a laserblast at the approaching enemy fighter, and
        it bursts into a spectacular explosion. Luke's projected
        screen gives a readout of the hit. The pirateship bounces
        slightly as it is struck by the enemy fire.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- TIE FIGHTER.

        The last of the attacking Imperial TIE fighters looms in,
        firing upon the Falcon.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GUNPORT.

        Solo swivels behind his cannon, his aim describing the arc of
        the TIE fighter. The fighter comes closer, firing at the
        pirateship, but a well-aimed blast from Solo's laser cannon
        hits the attacker, which blows up in a small atomic shower of
        burning fragments.

LUKE: (laughing) That's it! We did it!

           The princess jumps up and gives Chewie a congratulatory
        hug.

LEIA: We did it!

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- PASSAGEWAY.

        Threepio lies on the floor of the ship, completely tangled in
        the smoking, sparking wires.

THREEPIO: Help! I think I'm melting! (to Artoo) This is all your
fault.

           Artoo turns his dome from side to side, beeping in
        response.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON.

        The victorious Millennium Falcon moves off majestically
        through space.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONTROL ROOM.

        Darth Vader strides into the control room, where Tarkin is
        watching the huge view screen. A sea of stars is before him.

TARKIN: Are they away?

VADER: They have just made the jump into hyperspace.

TARKIN: You're sure the homing beacon is secure aboard their ship? I'm
taking an awful risk, Vader. This had better work.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Han, removes his gloves and smiling, is at the controls of the
        ship. Chewie moves into the aft section to check the damage.
        Leia is seated near Han.

HAN: Not a bad bit of rescuing, huh? You know, sometimes I even amaze
myself.

LEIA: That doesn't sound too hard. Besides, they let us go. It's the
only explanation for the ease of our escape.

HAN: Easy...you call that easy?

LEIA: Their tracking us!

HAN: Not this ship, sister.

           Frustrated, Leia shakes her head.

LEIA: At least the information in Artoo is still intact.

HAN: What's so important? What's he carrying?

LEIA: The technical readouts of that battle station. I only hope that
when the data is analyzed, a weakness can be found. It's not over yet!

HAN: It is for me, sister! Look, I ain't in this for your revolution,
and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in
it for the money!

LEIA: You needn't worry about your reward. If money is all that you
love, then that's what you'll receive!

           She angrily turns, and as she starts out of the cockpit,
        passes Luke coming in.

LEIA: Your friend is quite a mercenary. I wonder if he really cares
about anything...or anyone.

LUKE: I care!

           Luke, shaking his head, sits in the copilot seat. He and
        Han stare out at the vast blackness of space.

LUKE: So...what do you think of her, Han?

HAN: I'm trying not to, kid!

LUKE: (under his breath) Good...

HAN: Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you
think? Do you think a princess and a guy like me...

LUKE: No!

           Luke says it with finality and looks away. Han smiles at
        young Luke's jealousy.

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN.

        The battered pirateship drifts into orbit around the planet
        Yavin and proceeds to one of its tiny green moons.

EXTERIOR: FOURTH MOON OF YAVIN.

        The pirateship soars over the dense jungle.

EXTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST.

        An alert guard, his laser gun in hand, scans the countryside.
        He sets the gun down and looks toward the temple, barely
        visible in the foliage.

EXTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- JUNGLE TEMPLE.

        Rotting in a forest of gargantuan trees, an ancient temple
        lies shrouded in an eerie mist. The air is heavy with the
        fantastic cries of unimaginable creatures. Han, Luke and the
        others are greeted by the Rebel troops.
           Luke and the group ride into the massive temple on an
        armored military speeder.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI -- MAIN HANGAR DECK.

        The military speeder stops in a huge spaceship hangar, set up
        in the interior of the crumbling temple. Willard, the
        commander of the Rebel forces, rushes up to the group and
        gives Leia a big hug. Every one is pleased to see her.

WILLARD: (holding Leia) You're safe! We had feared the worst.

           Willard composes himself, steps back and bows formally.

WILLARD: When we heard about Alderaan, we were afraid that you were...
lost along with your father.

LEIA: We don't have time for our sorrows, Commander. The battle
station has surely tracked us here (looking pointedly to Han). It's
the only explanation for the ease of our escape. You must use the
information in this R2 unit to plan the attack. It is our only hope.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The surface of the Death Star ominously approaches the red
        planet Yavin.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONTROL ROOM.

        Grand Moff Tarkin and Lord Vader are interrupted in their
        discussion by the buzz of the comlink. Tarkin moves to answer
        the call.

TARKIN: Yes.

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE: We are approaching the planet Yavin. The
Rebel base is on a moon on the far side. We are preparing to orbit the
planet.

EXTERIOR: YAVIN -- JUNGLE.

        A lone guard stands in a tower high above the Yavin landscape,
        surveying the countryside. A mist hangs over the jungle of
        twisted green.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI -- WAR ROOM BRIEFING AREA.

        Dodonna stands before a large electronic wall display. Leia
        and several other senators are to one side of the giant
        readout. The low-ceilinged room is filled with starpilots,
        navigators, and a sprinkling of R2-type robots. Everyone is
        listening intently to what Dodonna is saying. Han and
        Chewbacca are standing near the back.

DODONNA: The battle station is heavily shielded and carries a
firepower greater than half the star fleet. It's defenses are designed
around a direct large-scale assault. A small one-man fighter should be
able to penetrate the outer defense.

           Gold Leader, a rough looking man in his early thirties,
        stands and addresses Dodonna.

GOLD LEADER: Pardon me for asking, sir, but what good are snub
fighters going to be against that?

DODONNA: Well, the Empire doesn't consider a small one-man fighter to
be any threat, or they'd have a tighter defense. An analysis of the
plans provided by Princess Leia has demonstrated a weakness in the
battle station.

           Artoo-Detoo stands next to a similar robot, makes beeping
        sounds, and turns his head from right to left.

DODONNA: The approach will not be easy. You are required to maneuver
straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point. The
target area is only two meters wide. It's a small thermal exhaust
port, right below the main port. The shaft leads directly to the
reactor system. A precise hit will start a chain reaction which should
destroy the station.

           A murmer of disbelief runs through the room.

DODONNA: Only a precise hit will set up a chain reaction. The shaft is
ray-shielded, so you'll have to use proton torpedoes.

           Luke is sitting next to Wedge Antilles, a hotshot pilot
        about sixteen years old.

WEDGE: That's impossible, even for a computer.

LUKE: It's not impossible. I used to bull's-eye womp rats in my
T-sixteen back home. They're not much bigger than two meters.

DODONNA: Man your ships! And may the Force be with you!

           The group rises and begins to leave.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The Death Star begins to move around the planet toward the
        tiny green moon.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Tarkin and Vader watch the computer projected screen with
        interest, as a circle of lights intertwines around one another
        on the screen showing it's position in relation to Yavin and
        the forth moon.

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE: Orbiting the planet at maximum velocity.
The moon with the Rebel base will be in range in thirty minutes.

VADER: This will be a day long remembered. It has seen the end of
Kenobi and it will soon see the end of the Rebellion.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- MAIN HANGAR DECK.

        Luke, Threepio and little Artoo enter the huge spaceship
        hangar and hurry along a long line of gleaming spacefighters.
        Flight crews rush around loading last-minute armaments and
        unlocking power couplings. In an area isolated from this
        activity Luke finds Han and Chewbacca loading small boxes onto
        an armored speeder.

MAN'S VOICE: (over loudspeaker) All flight trooper, man your stations.
All flight troops, man your stations.

           Han is deliberately ignoring the activity of the fighter
        pilots' preparation. Luke is quite saddened at the sight of
        his friend's departure.

LUKE: So...you got your reward and you're just leaving then?

HAN: That's right, yeah! I got some old debts I've got to pay off with
this stuff. Even if I didn't, you don't think I'd be fool enough to
stick around here, do you? Why don't you come with us? You're pretty
good in a fight. I could use you.

LUKE: (getting angry) Come on! Why don't you take a look around? You
know what's about to happen, what they're up against. They could use a
good pilot like you. You're turning your back on them.

HAN: What good's a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides,
attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like
suicide.

LUKE: All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's
what you're best at, isn't it?

           Luke goes off and Han hesitates, then calls to him.

HAN: Hey, Luke...may the Force be with you!

           Luke turns and sees Han wink at him. Luke lifts his hand in
        a small wave and then goes off. 
           Han turns to Chewie who growls at his captain,

HAN: What're you lookin' at? I know what I'm doing.

INTERIOR: MAIN HANGAR DECK -- LUKE'S SHIP.

        Luke, Leia, and Dodonna meet under a huge space fighter.

LEIA: What's wrong?

LUKE: Oh, it's Han! I don't know, I really thought he'd change his
mind. 

LEIA: He's got to follow his own path. No one can choose it for him.

LUKE: I only wish Ben were here.

           Leia gives Luke a little kiss, turns, and goes off. As Luke
        heads for his ship, another pilot rushes up to him and grabs
        his arm.

BIGGS: Luke! I don't believe it! How'd you get here...are you going
out with us?!

LUKE: Biggs! Of course, I'll be up there with you! Listen, have I got
some stories to tell...

           Red Leader, a rugged handsome man in his forties, comes up
        behind Luke and Biggs. He has the confident smile of a born
        leader.

RED LEADER: Are you...Luke Skywalker? Have you been checked out on the
Incom T-sixty-five?

BIGGS: Sir, Luke is the best bushpilot in the outer rim territories.

           Red Leader pats Luke on the back as they stop in front of
        his fighter.

RED LEADER: I met your father once when I was just a boy, he was a
great pilot. You'll do all right. If you've got half of your father's
skill, you'll do better than all right.

LUKE: Thank you, sir. I'll try.

           Red Leader hurries to his own ship.

BIGGS: I've got to get aboard. Listen, you'll tell me your stories
when we come back. All right?

LUKE: I told you I'd make it someday, Biggs.

BIGGS: (going off) You did, all right. It's going to be like old
times, Luke. We're a couple of shooting stars that'll never be
stopped!

           Luke laughs and shakes his head in agreement. He heads for
        his ship.
           As Luke begins to climb up the ladder into his sleek,
        deadly spaceship, the crew chief, who is working on the craft,
        points to little Artoo, who is being hoisted into a socket on
        the back of the fighter.

CHIEF: This R2 unit of your seems a bit beat up. Do you want a new
one?

LUKE: Not on your life! That little droid and I have been through a
lot together. (to Artoo) You okay, Artoo?

           The crewmen lower Artoo-Detoo into the craft. Now a part of
        the exterior shell of the starship, the little droid beeps
        that he is fine.
           Luke climbs up into the cockpit of his fighter and puts an
        his helmet. Threepio looks on from the floor of the massive
        hangar as the crewmen secure his little electronic partner
        into Luke's X-wing. It's an emotional-filled moment as Artoo
        beeps good-bye.

CHIEF: Okay, easy she goes!

THREEPIO: Hang on tight,Artoo, you've got to come back.

           Artoo beeps in agreement.

THREEPIO: You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?

           Artoo whistles his reply.
           All final preparations are made for the approaching battle.
        The hangar is buzzing with the last minute activity as the
        pilots and crewmen alike make their final adjustments. The hum
        of activity is occasionally trespassed by the distorted voice
        of the loudspeaker issuing commands. Coupling hoses are
        disconnected from the ships as they are fueled. Cockpit
        shields roll smoothly into place over each pilot. A signalman,
        holding red guiding lights, directs the ships. Luke, a trace
        of a smile gracing his lips, peers about through his goggles.

BEN'S VOICE: Luke, the Force will be with you.

           Luke is confused at the voice and taps his headphones.

EXTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- JUNGLE.

        All that can be seen of the fortress is a lone guard standing
        on a small pedestal jutting out above the dense jungle. The
        muted gruesome crying sounds that naturally permeate this
        eerie purgatory are overwhelmed by the thundering din of ion
        rockets as four silver starships catapult from the foliage in
        a tight formation and disappears into the morning cloud cover.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- WAR ROOM.

        The princess, Threepio, and a field commander sit quietly
        before the giant display showing the planet Yavin and its four
        moons. The red dot that represents the Death Star moves ever
        closer to the system. A series of green dots appear around the
        fourth moon. A din of indistinct chatter fills the war room.

MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE: Stand-by alert. Death Star approaching.
Estimated time to firing range, fifteen minutes.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The Death Star slowly moves behind the massive yellow surface
        of Yavin in the foreground, as many X-wing fighters flying in
        formation zoom toward us and out of the frame.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- ANOTHER ANGLE.

        Light from a distant sun creates an eerie atmospheric glow
        around a huge planet, Yavin. Rebel fighters flying in
        formation settle ominously in the foreground and very slowly
        pull away.

INTERIOR: RED LEADER STARSHIP -- COCKPIT.

        Red Leader lowers his visor and adjusts his gun sights,
        looking to each side at his wing men.

RED LEADER: All wings report in.

INTERIOR: ANOTHER COCKPIT.

        One of the Rebel fighters checks in through his mike.

RED TEN: Red Ten standing by.

INTERIOR: BIGGS' COCKPIT.

        Biggs checks his fighter's controls, alert and ready for
        combat.

RED SEVEN: (over Biggs' headset) Red Seven standing by.

BIGGS: Red Three standing by.

RED ELEVEN: (over headset) Red Eleven standing by.

LUKE: Red Five standing by.

EXTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER

        Artoo-Detoo, in position outside of the fighter, turns his
        head from side to side and makes beeping sounds.

INTERIOR: RED LEADER'S FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

RED LEADER: Lock S-foils in attack position.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The group of X-wing fighters move in formation toward the
        Death Star, unfolding the wings and locking them in the "X"
        position.

INTERIOR: BIGGS' COCKPIT

READ LEADER: (over headset) We're passing through their magnetic
field.

INTERIOR: RED LEADER'S COCKPIT.

RED LEADER: Hold tight!

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Luke adjusts his controls as he concentrates on the
        approaching Death Star. The ship begins to be buffeted
        slightly.

RED LEADER: (over headset) Switch your deflectors on.

INTERIOR: ANOTHER COCKPIT.

RED LEADER: (over headset) Double front!

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The fighters, now X-shaped darts, move in formation. The Death
        Star now appears to be a small moon growing rapidly in size as
        the Rebel fighters approach. Complex patterns on the metallic
        surface begin to become visible. A large dish antenna is built
        into the surface on one side.

INTERIOR: WEDGE'S COCKPIT.

        Wedge is amazed and slightly frightened at the awesome
        spectacle.

WEDGE: Look at the size of that thing!

RED LEADER: (over headset) Cut the chatter, Red Two.

INTERIOR: RED LEADER'S COCKPIT.

RED LEADER: Accelerate to attack speed. This is it, boys!

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        As the fighters move closer to the Death Star, the awesome
        size of the gargantuan Imperial fortress is revealed. Half of
        the deadly space station is in shadow and this area sparkles
        with thousands of small lights running in thin lines and
        occasionally grouped in large clusters; somewhat like a city
        at night as seen from a weather satellite.

INTERIOR: GOLD LEADER'S COCKPIT.

GOLD LEADER: Red Leader, this is Gold Leader.

RED LEADER: (over headset) I copy, Gold Leader.

GOLD LEADER: We're starting for the target shaft now.

INTERIOR: RED LEADER'S COCKPIT.

        Red Leader looks around at his wingmen; the Death Star looming
        in from behind. Two Y-wing fighters bob back and forth in the
        background. He moves his computer targeting device into
        position.

RED LEADER: We're in position. I'm going to cut across the axis and
try and draw their fire.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        Two squads of Rebel fighters peel off. The X-wings dive
        towards the Death Star surface. A thousand lights glow across
        the dark grey expanse of the huge station.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo-
        powered laser gun emplacements. Electronic drivers rotate the
        huge guns into position as crew adjust their targeting
        devices.

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        Laserbolts streak through the star-filled night. The Rebel
        X-wing fighters move in toward the Imperial base, as the Death
        Star aims its massive laser guns at the Rebel forces and
        fires.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- WAR ROOM.

        Princess Leia listens to the battle over the intercom.
        Threepio is at her side.

WEDGE: (over war room speaker system) Heavy fire, boss! Twenty-degrees.

RED LEADER: (over speaker) I see it. Stay low.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        An X-wing zooms across the surface of the Death Star.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Technical crews scurry here and there loading last-minute
        armaments and unlocking power cables.

INTERIOR: WEDGE'S COCKPIT.

        Wedge maneuvers his fighter toward the menacing Death Star.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        X-wings continue in their attack course on the Death Star.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Luke nosedives radically, starting his attack on the monstrous
        fortress. The Death Star surface streaks past the cockpit
        window.

LUKE: This is Red Five; I'm going in!

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        Luke's X-wing races toward the Death Star. Laserbolts streak
        from Luke's weapons, creating a huge fireball explosion on the
        dim surface.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Terror crosses Luke's face as he realizes he won't be able to
        pull out in time to avoid the fireball.

BIGGS: (over headset) Luke, pull up!

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF DEATH STAR.

        Luke's ship emerges from the fireball, with the leading edges
        of his wings slightly scorched.

INTERIOR: BIGGS' COCKPIT.

BIGGS: Are you all right?

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Luke adjusts his controls and breathes a sigh of relief. Flak
        bursts outside the cockpit window.

LUKE: I got a little cooked, but I'm okay.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        Rebel fighters continue to strafe the Death Star's surface
        with laserbolts.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Walls buckle and cave in. Troops and equipment are blown in
        all directions. Stormtroopers stagger out of the rubble.
        Standing in the middle of the chaos, a vision of calm and
        foreboding, is Darth Vader. One of his Astro-Officers rushes
        up to him.

ASTRO-OFFICER: We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord Vader. But they're so
small they're evading our turbo-lasers!

VADER: We'll have to destroy them ship to ship. Get the crews to their
fighters.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Smoke belches from the giant laser guns as they wind up their
        turbine generators to create sufficient power. The crew rushes
        about preparing for another blast. Even the troopers head gear
        is not adequate to protect them from the overwhelming noise of
        the monstrous weapon. One troopers bangs his helmet with his
        hand in an attempt to stop the ringing.

INTERIOR: READ LEADER'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        Red Leader flies through a heavy hail of flak.

RED LEADER: Luke, let me know when you're going in.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        The Red Leader's X-wing flies past Luke as he puts his nose
        down and starts his attack dive.

LUKE: I'm on my way in now...

RED LEADER: Watch yourself! There's a lot of fire coming from the
right side of that deflection tower.

LUKE: I'm on it.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        Luke flings his X-wing into a twisting dive across the horizon
        and down onto the dim grey surface.

EXTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING TRAVELING.

        A shot hurls from Luke's guns. Laserbolts streak toward the
        onrushing Death Star surface. Several small radar emplacements
        erupt in flame. Laserfire erupts from a protruding tower on
        the surface.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        The blurry Death Star surface races past the cockpit window as
        a big smile sweeps across Luke's face at the success of his
        run. Flak thunders on all sides of him.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        The Death Star superstructure races past Luke as he maneuvers
        his craft through a wall of laserfire and peels away from the
        surface towards the heavens.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        The thunder and smoke of the big guns reverberate throughout
        the massive structure. Many soldiers rush about in the smoke
        and chaos, silhouetted by the almost continual flash of
        explosions.

INTERIOR: BIGGS' COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        Biggs dives through a forest of radar domes, antennae, and gun
        towers as he shoots low across the Death Star surface. A dense
        barrage of laserfire streaks by on all sides.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Imperial star pilots dash in unison to a line of small
        auxiliary hatches that lead to Imperial TIE fighters.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- WAR ROOM.

        Princess Leia, surrounded by her generals and aides, paces
        nervously before a lighted computer table. On all sides
        technicians work in front of many lighted glass walls. Dodonna
        watches quietly from one corner. One of the officers working
        over a screen speaks into his headset.

CONTROL OFFICER: Squad leaders, we've picked up a new group of
signals. Enemy fighters coming your way.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        Luke looks around to see if he can spot the approaching
        Imperial fighters.

LUKE: My scope's negative. I don't see anything.

INTERIOR: RED LEADER'S X-WING -- COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        The Death Star's surface sweeps past as Red Leader searches
        the sky for the Imperial fighters. Flak pounds at his ship.

RED LEADER: Keep up your visual scanning. With all this jamming,
they'll be on top of you before your scope can pick them up.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        Silhouetted against the rim lights of the Death Star horizon,
        four ferocious Imperial TIE ships dive on the Rebel fighters.
        Two of the TIE fighters peel off and drop out of frame. Pan
        with the remaining two TIE ships.

INTERIOR: BIGGS' COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        Biggs panics when he discovers a TIE ship on his tail. The
        horizon in the background twists around as he peels off,
        hoping to lose the Imperial fighter.

INTERIOR: RED LEADER'S COCKPIT.

RED LEADER: Biggs! You've picked one up...watch it!

BIGGS: I can't see it! Where is he?!

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        Biggs zooms off the surface and into space, closely followed
        by an Imperial TIE fighter. The TIE ship fires several
        laserbolts at Biggs, but misses.

INTERIOR: BIGGS' COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        Biggs see the TIE ship behind him and swings around, trying to
        avoid him.

BIGGS: He's on me tight, I can't shake him...I can't shake him.

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        Biggs, flying at high altitude, peels off and dives toward the
        Death Star surface, but he is unable to lose the TIE fighter,
        who sticks close to his tail.

INTERIOR: X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        Luke is flying upside down. He rotates his ship around to
        normal attitude as he comes out of his dive.

LUKE: Hang on, Biggs, I'm coming in.

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        Biggs and the tailing TIE ship dive for the surface, now
        followed by a fast-gaining Luke. After Biggs dives out of
        sight, Luke chases the Imperial fighter.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        In the foreground, the Imperial fighter races across the Death
        Star's surface, closely followed by Luke in the background.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        There is a shot from Luke's X-wing of the TIE ship exploding
        in a mass of flames.

LUKE: Got him!

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Darth Vader strides purposefully down a Death Star corridor,
        flanked by Imperial stormtroopers.

VADER: Several fighters have broken off from the main group. Come with
me!

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- WAR ROOM.

        A concerned Princess Leia, Threepio, Dodonna, and other
        officers of the Rebellion stand around the huge round readout
        screen, listening to the ship-to-ship communication on the

RED TEN: (over speaker) There's a heavy fire zone on this side. Red
Five, where are you?

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT.

        Luke spots the TIE fighter behind him and soars away from the
        Death Star surface.

LUKE: I can't shake him!

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        Luke's ship soars closer to the surface of the Death Star, an
        Imperial TIE fighter closing in on him in hot pursuit.

        Luke reacts frantically.

LUKE: Blast it! Wedge where are you?

INTERIOR: TIE FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        The fighter pilot watches Wedge's X-wing approach. Another
        X-wing joins him, and both unleash a volley of laserfire on
        the Imperial fighter.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The TIE fighter explodes, filling the screen with white light.
        Luke's ship can be seen far in the distance.

        Gold Leader approaches the surface and pulls out to skim the
        surface of the huge station. The ship moves into a deep
        trench, firing laserbolts. The surface streaks past as
        laserfire is returned by the Death Star.

INTERIOR: GOLD FIVE'S Y-WING -- COCKPIT -- TRAVELING.

        Gold Five is a pilot in his early fifties with a very battered

        intense laser barrage.

GOLD TWO: Computer's locked. Getting a signal.

           As the fighters begin to approach the target area, suddenly
        all the laserfire stops. An eerie clam clings over the trench
        as the surface whips past in a blur.

        One of the engines explodes on Gold Five's Y-wing fighter,
        blazing out of control. He dives past the horizon toward the
        Death Star's surface, passing a TIE fighter during his
        descent. Gold Five, a veteran of countless campaigns, spins
        toward his death.

        The three TIE fighters, manned by Vader and his two wingmen,
        follow Luke's X-wing down the trench.

INTERIOR: DARTH VADER'S COCKPIT.

        Vader maneuvers his controls as he looks at his doomed target.
        He presses the fire buttons on his control sticks. Laserfire
        shoots toward Luke's X-wing fighter.

EXTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER.

        A large burst of Vader's laserfire engulfs Artoo. The arms go
        limp on the smoking little droid as he makes a high-pitched
        sound.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Luke looks frantically back over his shoulder at Artoo.

EXTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER.

        Smoke billows out around little Artoo and sparks begin to fly.

LUKE: I've lost Artoo!

           Artoo's beeping sounds die out.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- WAR ROOM.

        Leia and the others stare intently at the projected screen,
        while Threepio watches the Princess. Lights representing the
        Death Star and targets glow brightly.

MASSASSI INTERCOM VOICE: The Death Star has cleared the planet. The
Death Star has cleared the planet.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR -- CONTROL ROOM.

        Tarkin glares at the projected target screen.

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE: Rebel base, in range.

TARKIN: You may fire when ready.

DEATH STAR INTERCOM VOICE: Commence primary ignition.

           An officer reaches up and pushes buttons on the control
        panel, as green lighted buttons turn to red.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        The three TIE fighters zoom down the Death Star trench in
        pursuit of Luke, never breaking formation.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S COCKPIT.

        Luke looks anxiously at the exhaust port.

INTERIOR: DARTH VADER'S COCKPIT.

        Vader adjusts his control sticks, checking his projected
        targeting screen.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        Luke's ship barrels down the trench.

INTERIOR: DARTH VADER'S COCKPIT.

        Vader's targeting computer swings around into position. Vader
        takes careful aim on Luke's X-wing fighter.

VADER: I have you now.

           He pushes the fire buttons.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        The three TIE fighters move in on Luke. As Vader's center
        fighter unleashes a volley of laserfire, one of the TIE ships
        at his side is hit and explodes into flame. The two remaining
        ships continue to move in.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Luke looks about, wondering whose laserfire destroyed Vader's
        wingman.

INTERIOR: DARTH VADER'S COCKPIT.

        Vader is taken by surprise, and looks out from his cockpit.

VADER: What?

INTERIOR: DARTH VADER'S WINGMAN -- COCKPIT.

        Vader's wingman searches around him trying to locate the
        unknown attacker.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Han and Chewbacca grin from ear to ear.

HAN: (yelling) Yahoo!

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        The Millennium Falcon heads right at the two TIE fighters.
        It's a collision course.

INTERIOR: WINGMAN'S COCKPIT.

        The wingman spots the pirateship coming at him and warns the
        Dark Lord.

WINGMAN: Look out!

EXTERIOR: DEATH STAR TRENCH.

        Vader's wingman panics at the sight of the oncoming pirate
        starship and veers radically to one side, colliding with
        Vader's TIE fighter in the process. Vader's wingman crashes
        into the side wall of the trench and explodes. Vader's damaged
        ship spins out of the trench with a damaged wing.

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        Vader's ship spins out of control with a bent solar fin,
        heading for deep space.

        Vader turns round and round in circles as his ship spins
        into space.

        Solo's ship moves in toward the Death Star trench.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

        Solo, smiling, speaks to Luke over his headset mike.

HAN: (into mike) You're all clear, kid.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- WAR ROOM.

        Leia and the others listen to Solo's transmission.

HAN: (over speaker) Now let's blow this thing and go home!

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Luke looks up and smiles. He concentrates on the exhaust port,
        then fires his laser torpedoes.

EXTERIOR: SURFACE OF THE DEATH STAR.

        Luke's torpedoes shoot toward the port and seems to simply
        disappear into the surface and not explode. But the shots do
        find their mark and have gone into the exhaust port and are
        heading for the main reactor.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Luke throws his head back in relief.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        An Imperial soldier runs to the control panel board and pulls
        the attack lever as the board behind him lights up.

INTERCOM VOICE: Stand by to fire at Rebel base.

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        Two X-wings, a Y-wing, and the pirateship race toward Yavin in
        the distance.

INTERIOR: DEATH STAR.

        Several Imperial soldiers, flanking a pensive Grand Moff
        Tarkin, busily push control levers and buttons.

INTERCOM VOICE: Standing by.

           The rumble of a distant explosion begins.

EXTERIOR: SPACE AROUND THE DEATH STAR.

        The Rebel ships race out of sight, leaving the moon-like Death
        Star alone against a blanket of stars. Several small flashes
        appear on the surface. The Death Star bursts into a supernova,
        creating a spectacular heavenly display.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT.

HAN: Great shot, kid. That was one in a million.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING FIGHTER -- COCKPIT.

        Luke is at ease, and his eyes are closed.

BEN'S VOICE: Remember, the Force will be with you...always.

           The ship rocks back and forth.

EXTERIOR: DARTH VADER'S TIE FIGHTER.

        Vader's ship spins off into space.

EXTERIOR: SPACE.

        The Rebel ships race toward the fourth moon of Yavin.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- MAIN HANGAR.

        Luke climbs out of his starship fighter and is cheered by a
        throng of ground crew and pilots. Luke climbs down the ladder
        as they all welcome him with laughter, cheers, and shouting.
           Princess Leia rushes toward him.

LEIA: Luke! Luke! Luke!

           She throws her arms around Luke and hugs him as they dance
        around in a circle. Solo runs in toward Luke and they embrace
        one another, slapping each other on the back.

HAN: (laughing) Hey! Hey!

LUKE: (laughing) I knew you'd come back! I just knew it!

HAN: Well, I wasn't gonna let you get all the credit and take all the
reward.

           Luke and Han look at one another, as Solo playfully shoves
        at Luke's face. Leia moves in between them.

LEIA: (laughing) Hey, I knew there was more to you than money.

           Luke looks toward the ship.

LUKE: Oh, no!

        The fried little Artoo-Detoo is lifted off the back of the
        fighter and carried off under the worried eyes of Threepio.

THREEPIO: Oh, my! Artoo! Can you hear me? Say something! (to mechanic)
You can repair him, can't you?

TECHNICIAN: We'll get to work on him right away.

THREEPIO: You must repair him! Sir, if any of my circuits or gears
will help, I'll gladly donate them.

LUKE: He'll be all right.

INTERIOR: MASSASSI OUTPOST -- MAIN THRONE ROOM.

        Luke, Han, and Chewbacca enter the huge ruins of the main
        temple. Hundreds of troops are lined up in neat rows. Banners
        are flying and at the far end stands a vision in white, the
        beautiful young Senator Leia. Luke and the others solemnly
        march up the long aisle and kneel before Senator Leia. From
        one side of the temple marches a shined-up and fully repaired
        Artoo-Detoo. He waddles up to the group and stands next to an
        equally pristine Threepio, who is rather awestruck by the
        whole event. Chewbacca is confused. Dodonna and several other
        dignitaries sit on the left of the Princess Leia. Leia is
        dressed in a long white dress and is staggeringly beautiful.
        She rises and places a gold medallion around Han's neck. He
        winks at her. She then repeats the ceremony with Luke, who is
        moved by the event. They turn and face the assembled troops,
        who all bow before them. Chewbacca growls and Artoo beeps with
        happiness.

                                    FADE OUT

                             END CREDITS OVER STARS

                        ----------------------


A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far, away...


          It is a dark time for the
          Rebellion. Although the Death
          Star has been destroyed,
          Imperial troops have driven the
          Rebel forces from their hidden
          base and pursued them across
          the galaxy.

          Evading the dreaded Imperial
          Starfleet, a group of freedom
          fighters led by Luke Skywalker
          has established a new secret
          base on the remote ice world
          of Hoth.

          The evil lord Darth Vader,
          obsessed with finding young
          Skywalker, has dispatched
          thousands of remote probes into
          the far reaches of space....


EXTERIOR: GALAXY -- PLANET HOTH

           A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe
        robots from its underside. 
           One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands
        on its ice-covered surface. An explosion marks the point of
        impact. 

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- METEORITE CRATER -- SNOW PLAIN -- DAY

           A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the
        wind. A strange probe robot, with several extended sensors,
        emerges from the smoke-shrouded crater. The ominous mechanical
        probe floats across the snow plain and disappears into the
        distance.

EXTERIOR: PLAIN OF HOTH -- DAY

           A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope. The
        bundled rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a
        Tauntaun. Curving plumes of snow rise from beneath the
        speeding paws of the two-legged beast.
           The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a
        stop. Pulling off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker
        notices something in the sky. He takes a pair of
        electrobinoculars from his utility belt and through them sees
        smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.
           The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a
        comlink transmitter. His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously
        beneath him.

LUKE: (into comlink) Echo Three to Echo Seven. Han, old buddy, do you
read me?
           After a little static a familiar voice is heard.

HAN: (over comlink) Loud and clear, kid. What's up?

LUKE: (into comlink) Well, I finished my circle. I don't pick up any
life readings.

HAN: (over comlink) There isn't enough life on this ice cube to fill a
space cruiser. The sensors are placed. I'm going back.

LUKE: (into comlink) Right. I'll see you shortly. There's a meteorite
that hit the ground near here. I want to check it out. It won't take
long.

           Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his
        nervous lizard. He pats the beast on the head to calm it.

LUKE: Hey, steady girl. What's the matter? You smell something?

           Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to
        adjust it when suddenly a large shadow falls over him from
        behind. He hears a monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-
        foot-tall shape towering over him. It is a Wampa Ice Creature,
        lunging at him ferociously.

LUKE: Aaargh!

           Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a
        huge white claw. He falls unconscious into the snow and in a
        moment the terrified screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by
        the horrible snap of a neck being broken.
           The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags
        him away across the frozen plain.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE ENTRANCE -- DAY

           A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance
        of an enormous ice cave.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR DECK

           Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise
        securing their new base. The rider, Han Solo, swings off his
        lizard and pulls off his goggles.
           He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium
        Falcon, which is parked among several fighters. Mechanics, R2
        units, and various other droids hurry about. Han stops at the
        Millennium Falcon where his Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is
        welding on a central lifter. Chewie stops his work and lifts
        his face shield, growling an irritated greeting to his boss.

HAN: Chewie!

           The Wookiee grumbles a reply.

HAN: All right, don't lose your temper. I'll come right back and give
you a hand.

           Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding
        as Han leaves.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- COMMAND CENTER

           A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area
        of thick ice. The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity.
        Controllers, troops, and droids move about setting up
        electronic equipment and monitoring radar signals.
           General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's
        approach.

RIEEKAN: Solo?

HAN: No sign of life out there, General. The sensors are in place.
You'll know if anything comes around.

RIEEKAN: Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

HAN: No. He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him.

RIEEKAN: (indicates radar screen) With all the meteor activity in this
system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.

           Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.

HAN: General, I've got to leave. I can't stay anymore.

           Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a
        short white combat jacket and pants. Her hair is braided across
        her head in a Nordic fashion. She overhears their 
        conversation and seems somewhat distressed.

RIEEKAN: I'm sorry to hear that.

HAN: Well, there's a price on my head. If I don't pay off Jabba the
Hut, I'm a dead man.

RIEEKAN: A death mark's not an easy thing to live with. You're a good
fighter, Solo. I hate to lose you.

HAN: Thank you, General.

           He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.

HAN: (with feeling) Well, Your Highness, I guess this is it.

LEIA: That's right.

           Leia is angry. Han sees she has no warmth to offer him. He
        shakes his head and adopts a sarcastic tone.

HAN: (cooly) Well, don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.

           Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the
        command center. Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- ICE CORRIDOR

LEIA: Han!

           Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.

HAN: Yes, Your Highnessness?

LEIA: I thought you decided to stay.

HAN:
"Well, the bounty hunter we ran into on Ord Mantell changed my mind."

LEIA: Han, we need you!

HAN: We?

LEIA: Yes.

HAN: Oh, what about you need?

LEIA: (mystified) I need? I don't know what you're talking about.

HAN: (shakes his head, fed up) You probably don't.

LEIA: And what precisely am I supposed to know?

HAN: Come on! You want me to stay because of the way you feel about
me.

LEIA: Yes. You're a great help to us. You're a natural leader...

HAN: No! That's not it. Come on. Aahhh -- uh huh! Come on.

           Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.

LEIA: You're imagining things.

HAN: Am I? Then why are you following me? Afraid I was going to leave
without giving you a goodbye kiss?

LEIA: I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

HAN: I can arrange that. You could use a good kiss!

           Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after
        him.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR

           A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach
        of Artoo-Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner
        and move along an ice wall toward the main hangar.

THREEPIO: Don't try to blame me. I didn't ask you to turn on the
thermal heater. I merely commented that it was freezing in the
princess's chamber. But it's supposed to be freezing. How are we going
to dry out all her clothes? I really don't know.

           Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.

THREEPIO: Oh, switch off.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR DECK

           The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter. Han and
        Chewie are struggling with their central lifters.

HAN: (to Chewie) Why do you take this apart now? I'm trying to get us
out of here and you pull both of these.

           Chewie grumbles in irritation.

THREEPIO: Excuse me, sir.

HAN: (to Chewie) Put them back together right now.

THREEPIO: Might I have a word with you, please?

HAN: What do you want?

THREEPIO: Well, it's Princess Leia, sir. She's been trying to get you
on the communicator.

HAN: I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.

THREEPIO: Oh. Well, Princess Leia is wondering about Master Luke. He
hasn't come back yet. She doesn't know where he is.

HAN: I don't know where he is.

THREEPIO: Nobody knows where he is.

HAN: What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

           Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice
        cave as night slowly begins to fall on the planet.

THREEPIO: Well, uh, you see...

           Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.

HAN: Deck Officer. Deck Officer!

THREEPIO: Excuse me, sir. Might I inqu-...

           Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the
        deck officer approaches.

DECK OFFICER: Yes, sir?

HAN: Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?

DECK OFFICER: I haven't seen him. It's possible he came in through the
south entrance.

HAN: It's possible? Why don't you go find out? It's getting dark out
there.

DECK OFFICER: Yes, sir.

           The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand
        off Threepio's mouth.

THREEPIO: Excuse me, sir. Might I inquire what's going on?

HAN: Why not?

THREEPIO: Impossible man. Come along, Artoo, lets find Princess Leia.
Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- MAIN ICE TUNNEL

           The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he
        enters the tunnel.

DECK OFFICER: Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't come in through the
south entrance. He might have forgotten to check in.

HAN: Not likely. Are the speeders ready?

DECK OFFICER: Not yet. We're having some trouble adapting them to the
cold.

HAN: Then we'll have to go out on Tauntauns.

DECK OFFICER: Sir, the temperature's dropping too rapidly.

HAN: That's right. And my friends out in it.

ASSISTANT OFFICER: I'll cover sector twelve. Have com-control set
screen alpha.

           Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.

DECK OFFICER: Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you reach the first
marker.

HAN: Then I'll see you in hell!

           Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the
        dark bitter night.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE GORGE -- DUSK

           The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim
        twilight of a Hoth day. Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen
        into icy stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the
        snow floor. One side of his face is covered in a dried mask of
        frozen blood. He opens his eyes as a chilling moan of the
        hideous ice creature echoes off the gorge walls. Luke pulls
        himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and futilely tries to
        unfasten the throngs.
           Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position. As he
        hangs there, he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his
        discarded gear, about three feet out of reach.
           He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the
        weapon, he squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.
           Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber
        jumps into Luke's hand.
           The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up,
        and cuts himself loose from the ice. He flops to the snow in a
        heap. The startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes
        blinking. Luke scrambles to his feet. He swings his lightsaber
        and the beast screams in pain.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE -- DUSK

           Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy
        twilight. Weak and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- SNOW PLAIN -- DUSK

           A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the
        hostile vastness of snow and cold. As it runs, the Tauntaun's
        legs kick up large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- OUTSIDE ICE HANGAR -- DUSK

           Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.
        Threepio moves stiffly over to him.

THREEPIO: You must come along now, Artoo. There's really nothing more
we can do. And my joints are freezing up.

           Artoo beeps, long and low.

THREEPIO: Don't say thing like that! Of course we'll see Master Luke
again. He'll be quite all right, you'll see. (to himself) Stupid
little short-circuit. He'll be quite all right.

           Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo
        mournfully keeps his vigil.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- SNOW DRIFT -- DUSK

           The wind is blowing quite strong now. Luke struggles to
        stay upright, but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over. He
        struggles to get up, but he can't. The young warrior from
        Tatooine drags himself a couple of feet and then collapses.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR DECK -- ENTRANCE -- NIGHT

           Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel
        base, waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes. She shivers
        in the cold wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his
        hands. In the background, Artoo and Threepio move through the
        doors. 
           A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer
        keeping watch with the princess.

LIEUTENANT: Sir, all the patrols are in. There's still no contact from
Skywalker or Solo.

THREEPIO: Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been quite unable to pick up
any signals, although he does admit that his own range is far too
weak to abandon all hope.

           Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.

DERLIN: Your Highness, there's nothing more we can do tonight. The
shield doors must be closed.

           He turns to the lieutenant.

DERLIN: Close the doors.

LIEUTENANT: Yes, sir.

           The lieutenant walks away. Chewie lets out a long, mournful
        howl, somewhat like a coyote. At the same moment, Artoo begins
        a complex series of efficient beeps.

THREEPIO: Artoo says the chances of survival are seven hundred
seventy-five...to one.

           Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam
        across the entrance of the ice cave. The loud booms echo
        throughout the huge cavern. Chewie lets out another suffering
        howl.

THREEPIO: Actually, Artoo has been known to make mistakes...from time
to time. Oh, dear, oh, dear. Don't worry about Master Luke. I'm sure
he'll be all right. He's quite clever, you know...for a human being.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- SNOW DRIFT -- DUSK

           Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious. Slowly
        he looks up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the
        blowing snow. It is hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a
        hallucination.

BEN: Luke...Luke.

LUKE: (weakly) Ben?

BEN: You will go to the Dagobah system.

LUKE: Dagobah system?

BEN: There you will learn from Yoda, the Jedi Master who instructed
me.

           The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider
        approaching from the windswept horizon.

LUKE: (groaning faintly) Ben...Ben.

           Luke drops into unconsciousness.
           Han pulls up and leaps off his mount. He hurries to his
        snow-covered friend, cradling him in his arms. Han's Tauntaun
        lets out a low, pitiful bellow. But Han's concern is with
        Luke, and he shakes him urgently.

HAN: Luke! Luke! Don't do this, Luke. Come on, give me a sign here.

           Luke doesn't respond. Han begins frantically rubbing and
        slapping Luke's unconscious face. As he starts to lift the
        youth, Han hears a rasping sound behind him. He turns, just in
        time to see his Tauntaun stagger and then fall over into the
        snow.
           Han carries Luke to the moaning beast. Then, with a final
        groan, the Tauntaun expires.

HAN: Not much time.

           He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead
        beast.

LUKE: (moaning) Ben...Ben...

HAN: Hang on, kid.

LUKE: Dagobah system...

           Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to
        toe. He quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow,
        then lifts Luke's inert form and stuffs him inside the
        carcass.

HAN: (reeling from the odor) Whew...

LUKE: Dagobah...

HAN: This may smell bad, kid...

LUKE: (moaning) Yoda...

HAN: ...but it will keep you warm...til I get the shelter built.
(struggling to get Luke in the carcass) Ooh...I thought they smelled
bad on the outside!

           The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to
        move. Han removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking
        out a shelter container. He begins to set up what can only be
        a pitiful protection against a bitter Hoth night.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- SNOWDRIFT -- DAWN

           Four snub-nosed armored snowspeeders race across the white
        landscape.

INTERIOR: SNOWSPEEDER COCKPIT

           There is only one pilot, Zev, in the enclosed two-man
        craft. He concentrates on the scopes which ring his cockpit.
        He hears a low beep from one of his monitors.

ZEV: (into transmitter) Echo Base...I've got something! Not much, but
it could be a life form.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- SNOWDRIFT

           The small craft banks and makes a slow arc, then races off
        in a new direction.

INTERIOR: SNOWSPEEDER -- COCKPIT

           The pilot switches over to a new transmitter.

ZEV: (into transmitter) This is Rouge Two. this is Rouge Two. Captain
Solo, so you copy? Commander Skywalker, do you copy? This is Rouge
Two.

           There is a sharp crackle of static, then a faint voice.

HAN: (filtered over Zev's receiver) Good morning. Nice of you guys to
drop by.

ZEV: (switching transmitters) Echo Base...this is Rouge Two. I found
them. Repeat, I found them.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- SNOWDRIFT -- DAY

           The small shelter Han set up is covered with snow on the
        windward side. A makeshift antenna rests gingerly on top the
        snowdrift. Han spots Zev's snowspeeder approaching in the
        distance, and begins waving his arms frantically at the tiny
        craft.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MEDICAL CENTER

           Strange robot surgeons adjust a mass of electronic
        equipment. A switch is thrown and a sudden blinding flash
        obscures Luke in a bacta tank filled with a thick, gelatinous
        slime. He begins to thrash about, raving in delirium.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MEDICAL CENTER -- RECOVERY ROOM

           Luke sits up in a recovery-room bed, weak but smiling. His
        face shows terrible wounds from the Wampa's attack. Threepio
        and Artoo enter the room.

THREEPIO: Master Luke, sir, it's good to see you fully functional
again.

           Artoo beeps his good wishes.

THREEPIO: Artoo expresses his relief, also.

           Han and Chewie make their entrance. The Wookiee growls a
        greeting.

HAN: How are you feeling, kid? You don't look so bad to me. In fact,
you look strong enough to pull the ears off a Gundark.

LUKE: Thanks to you.

HAN: That's two you owe me, junior.

           Han turns as Leia enters the room. He looks at her with a
        big, devilish grin.

HAN: Well your Worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a
little while longer.

LEIA: (haughtily) I had nothing to do with it. General Rieekan thinks
it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated
the energy shield.

HAN: That's a good story. I think you just can't bear to let a
gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.

LEIA: I don't know where you get you delusions, laser brain.

           Chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner. Han, enjoying
        himself, regards Chewie good-humoredly.

HAN: Laugh it up, fuzz ball. But you didn't see us alone in the south
passage.

           Luke sparks to this; he looks at Leia.

HAN: She expressed her true feelings for me.

           Leia is flushed, eyes darting between Luke and Han.

LEIA: My...! Why, you stuck up,...half-witted,...scruffy-looking...
nerf-herder!

HAN: Who's scruffy-looking? (to Luke) I must have hit her pretty close
to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?

           Leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls
        again, and she focuses on Luke.

LEIA: Why, I guess you don't know everything about women yet?

           With that she leans over and kisses Luke on the lips. Then
        she turns on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the
        room slightly dumbstruck. With some smugness, Luke puts his
        hands behind his head and grins.
           Suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is
        heard.

ANNOUNCER: (over loudspeaker) Headquarters personnel, report to command
center.

           The voice repeats the order and Han, Chewie, Artoo, and
        Threepio hurry out of the room, bidding farewell to Luke.

HAN: Take it easy.

THREEPIO: Excuse us, please.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- COMMAND CENTER

           Rieekan looks up grimly from a console screen. He calls
        over to Leia and Han.

RIEEKAN: Princess...we have a visitor.

           The group hurries over to Rieekan.

RIEEKAN: We've picked up something outside the base in zone twelve,
moving east.

SENIOR CONTROLLER: It's metal.

LEIA: Then it couldn't be one of those creatures that attacked Luke.

HAN: It could be a speeder, one of ours.

SENIOR CONTROLLER: No. Wait -- there's something very weak coming
through.

           Threepio steps up to the control panel and listens intently
        to the strange signal.

THREEPIO: Sir, I am fluent in six million forms of communication. This
signal is not used by the Alliance. It could be an Imperial code.

           The transmission ends in static.

HAN: It isn't friendly, whatever it is. Come on, Chewie, let's check
it out.

RIEEKAN: Send Rouges Ten and Eleven to station three-eight.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- SNOW PLAIN -- DAY

           The dark probe robot moves past the smoldering ruins of
        station three-eight and down a ridge toward the Rebel base. It
        raises a large antenna from the top of its head and begins to
        send out a piercing signal.
           The probe droid has spotted Chewbacca who, not thirty feet
        away, has popped his head over a snow bank. Instantly, the
        probe robot swings around, its deadly ray ready to fire. But
        before it can get a shot off, it is hit from behind by a laser
        bolt, and explodes in a million pieces.
           Han Solo replaces his blaster in its holster and peers
        intently at the smoldering remains of the Imperial probe.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- COMMAND CENTER

           Leia and Rieekan listen to Han on the comlink.

HAN: (over comlink) Afraid there's not much left.

LEIA: (into comlink) What was it?

HAN: (over comlink) Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard. It
must have had a self-destruct.

LEIA: (into comlink) An Imperial probe droid.

HAN: (over comlink) It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.

RIEEKAN: We'd better start the evacuation.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- IMPERIAL FLEET

           Darth Vader's Star Destroyer, larger and more awesome than
        the five Imperial Star Destroyers that surround it, sits in
        the vastness of space. The six huge ships are surrounded by a
        convoy of smaller spacecraft. TIE fighters dart to and fro.

INTERIOR: DARTH VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE -- MAIN CONTROL DECK

           Controllers working the vast complex of electronic controls
        hear ominous approaching footsteps and look up from their
        controls. The squat, evil-looking Admiral Ozzel and the young,
        powerfully built General Veers, who have been conferring near
        the front, also feel the approaching presence and turn toward
        it. Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith, enters like a chill wind.
        As Vader moves across the wide bridge, Captain Piett hurries
        up to Ozzel.

PIETT: Admiral.

OZZEL: Yes, Captain

PIETT: I think we've got something, sir. The report is only a fragment
from a probe droid in the Hoth system, but it's the best lead we've
had.

OZZEL: (irritated) We have thousands of probe droids searching the
galaxy. I want proof, not leads!

PIETT: The visuals indicate life readings.

OZZEL: It could mean anything. If we followed every lead...

PIETT: But, sir, the Hoth system is supposed to be devoid of human
forms.

           Vader moves to a large screen showing an image of the Rebel
        snow base. Rebel speeders can be seen approaching the base in
        the distance.

VADER: You found something?

PIETT: Yes, my lord.

VADER: (studying the image on the console screen) That's it. The
Rebels are there.

OZZEL: My lord, there are so many uncharted settlements. It could be
smugglers, it could be...

VADER: That is the system. And I'm sure Skywalker is with them. Set
your course for the Hoth system. General Veers, prepare you men.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- TRANSPORT BAY

           A captain issues instructions to two of his men at the
        entrance to the main transport bay. Several Rebel transports
        behind them are being loaded by men carrying heavy boxes and
        moving quickly, but not in panic.

REBEL CAPTAIN: Groups seven and ten will stay behind to fly the
speeders. As soon as each transport is loaded, evacuation control will
give clearance for immediate launch.

REBEL FIGHTER: Right, sir.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR DECK

           Alarms sound. Troops, ground crews, and droids rush to
        their alert stations. Armored snowspeeders are lined up in
        attack formation near the main entrance.
           In the midst of all this activity, Han does some frantic
        welding on the lifters of the Millennium Falcon.
           Han finishes his work and hops down to the hangar floor. He
        pulls out his comlink, all the while eyeing problematic
        lifters.

HAN: (into comlink, to Chewie) Okay, that's it. Try it...Off! Turn it
off! Turn it off! Off!

           Smoke rises from a minor explosion on the lifter.
        Exasperated, Han surveys the new damage.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MEDICAL CENTER

           Luke dresses in readiness for the evacuation as his
        attending medical droid stands by.

MEDICAL DROID: Sir, it will take quite awhile to evacuate the T-forty-
sevens.

LUKE: Well, forget the heavy equipment. There's plenty of time to get
the smaller modules on the transports.

MEDICAL DROID: Take care, sir.

LUKE: Thanks.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR DECK

           Pilots, gunners, and R2 units scurry about. Luke, pulling
        on his heavy-weather jacket, is headed toward a row of armored
        speeders. He stops at the rear of the Millennium Falcon, where
        Han and Chewie are trying to repair the right lifter with even
        more haste than before.

LUKE: Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?

           As Luke pats Chewie on the arm, Chewie puts his arms around
        Luke and gives him a tight hug. Han is discussing the lifter
        with a repair droid when he sees Luke.

HAN: Hi, kid. (to droid) There's got to be a reason for it. Check it
at the other end. Wait a second. (to Luke) You all right?

LUKE: Yeah.

HAN: Be careful.

LUKE: You, too.

           Luke smiles, then waves at his friend and walks on. After a
        few steps, he stops and looks back. Han glances up and the two
        exchange a silent communication, each wishing the other
        safety, happiness -- many things, all difficult to verbalize.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- CONTROL ROOM.

           Alarms sound throughout the hidden Rebel base. In the
        control room, a controller urgently gestures for General
        Rieekan to check a computer scan.

CONTROLLER: General, there's a fleet of Star Destroyers coming out of
hyperspace in sector four.

RIEEKAN: Reroute all power to the energy shield. We've got to hold
them till all transports are away. Prepare for ground assault.

           Rieekan exits hurriedly.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- VADER'S CHAMBER -- MEDITATION CUBICLE

           The dark cubicle is illuminated by a single shaft of light
        which falls on the brooding Dark Lord as he sits on a raised
        meditation cube. General Veers enters the room and approaches
        the silent, unmoving Vader. Although seemingly very sure of
        himself, Veers is still not bold enough to interrupt the
        meditating lord. The younger general stands quietly at
        attention until the evil presence speaks.

VADER: What is it, General?

VEERS: My lord, the fleet has moves out of light-speed. Com-Scan has
detected an energy field protecting an area around the sixth planet of
the Hoth system. The field is strong enough to deflect any
bombardment.

VADER: (angrily) The Rebels are alerted to our presence. Admiral Ozzel
came out of light-speed too close to the system.

VEERS: He felt surprise was wiser...

VADER: He is as clumsy as he is stupid. General, prepare your troops
for a surface attack.

VEERS: Yes, my lord.

           Veers turns smartly and leaves as Vader activates a large
        viewscreen showing the bridge of his mighty ship. Admiral
        Ozzel appears on the viewscreen, standing slightly in front of
        Captain Piett.

OZZEL: Lord Vader, the fleet has moved out of light-speed, and we're
preparing to...Aaagh!

VADER: You have failed me for the last time, Admiral. Captain Piett.

           Piett steps forward, as the admiral moves away, slightly
        confused, touching his throat as it begins to constrict
        painfully.

PIETT: Yes, my lord.

VADER: Make ready to land out troops beyond the energy shield and
deploy the fleet so that nothing gets off that system. You are in
command now, Admiral Piett.

PIETT: Thank you, Lord Vader.

           Piett's pleasure about his unexpected promotion is not an
        unmixed emotion. He glances warily at the struggling Admiral
        Ozzel who, with a final choke, stumbles and falls in a
        lifeless heap before him.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR DECK

           With a sense of urgency, Leia quickly briefs a group of
        pilots gathered in the center of the hangar.

LEIA: All troop carriers will assemble at the north entrance. The
heavy transport ships will leave as soon as they're loaded. Only two
fighter escorts per ship. The energy shield can only be opened for a
short time, so you'll have to stay very close to your transports.

HOBBIE: Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?

LEIA: The ion cannon will fire several shots to make sure that any
enemy ships will be out of your flight path. When you've gotten past
the energy shield, proceed directly to the rendezvous point.
Understood?

PILOTS: (in unison) Right. Okay.

LEIA: Good luck.

DERLIN: Okay. Everyone to your stations. Let's go!

           The pilots hurry away.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- SNOW TRENCH -- DAY

           Rebel troops carry heavy bazooka-type weapons and position
        them along the snow trench. Men hurriedly respond to their
        officers' yelled orders and brace themselves against the
        rhythmic gusts of bitter-cold wind.
           Other troops load power packs into a gun turret and swing
        its guns into position.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- POWER GENERATORS

           Near the base power generators, troops rush to set up their
        heavy battle equipment. Buzzing loudly, the generators send
        along, sparking fingers of energy into the bitter Hoth wind.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- COMMAND CENTER

           The long line of Rebel controllers is tense, as are
        Princess Leia and General Rieekan, who are trying very hard
        not to show any fear.

RIEEKAN: Their primary target will be the power generators. Prepare to
open the shield.

EXTERIOR: ICE PLAIN

           The Rebel transport and two escort fighters begin their
        departure from the ice planet.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

           A huge Imperial Star Destroyer rest against a sea of stars,
        far above the white surface of the planet Hoth.

INTERIOR: IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

           An Imperial controller approaches his commander.

CONTROLLER: Sir, Rebel ships are coming into our sector.

CAPTAIN: Good. Our first catch of the day.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- COMMAND CENTER

WOMAN CONTROLLER: Stand by, ion control....Fire!

EXTERIOR: REBEL BASE ICE CAVE -- ION CANNON

           The giant ball-shaped ion cannon rotates into position and
        blasts two red energy beams skyward.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- HOTH -- REBEL TRANSPORT

           The Rebel transport and its escort race away from the white
        planet, closely followed by the two red energy beams.
           As the Rebel transport races toward the waiting Imperial
        Star Destroyer, it is overtaken by the two scarlet energy
        bolts. The Imperial Star Destroyer is hit in the conning tower
        by the powerful bolts, which set up fiery explosions on its
        metal hull.
           The big Star Destroyer veers, then spins wildly out of
        control. As the Imperial ship careers into deep space, the
        Rebel transport races away to safety.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR DECK

           Pilots, gunners, and troopers hurry to their stations and
        their vehicles.

ANNOUNCER: (over loudspeaker) The first transport is away.

          Everyone cheers at the announcement, which echoes through
        the hangar. Luke turns and walks on, heading toward his
        snowspeeder. His gunner, Dack, a fresh-faced, eager kid, is
        glad to see him. They climb in.

DACK: Feeling all right, sir?

LUKE: Just like new, Dack. How about you?

DACK: Right now I feel I could take on the whole Empire myself.

LUKE: (quietly, strapping in) I know what you mean.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN

           A thin horizon line cuts across the bleak landscape. Small
        dot-size objects begin to appear on the horizon, moving in the
        direction of the Rebel base.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- SNOW TRENCH

           A Rebel officer lifts a pair of electrobinoculars to his
        eyes. Through the lens he sees a very close view of a giant
        Imperial snow walker. He adjusts the view which then zooms
        back to reveal three more of the ominous battle machines.
        Small flashes of yellow fire billow from the guns of the
        lumbering snow walkers.
           The officer lowers his binoculars as the regular rhythmic
        pounding begins to make the ground vibrate. The pounding grows
        louder and is accompanied by a high-pitched, metallic
        rattling. The officer speaks into his comlink.

TRENCH OFFICER: Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- CORRIDOR

           Pilots and gunners race to their waiting snowspeeders. Ice
        and snow begin falling from the walls of the corridor, shaken
        by the pounding Imperial snow walker as they draw ever nearer.

TRENCH OFFICER: (over comlink) We have spotted Imperial walkers!

CONTROLLER: Imperial walkers on the north ridge.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- SNOW TRENCH

           The Rebel troops aim their weapons at the horizon as
        explosions erupt all around them. They are nervous and their
        grip on their weapons tightens from the cold and from fear.
           Behind the troops a dozen snowspeeders race through the
        sky.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

LUKE: (into comlink) Echo station Five-Seven. We're on our way.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- BATTLEFIELD

           The fleet of snowspeeders races above the ice field at full
        throttle. They accelerate away from the base and head toward
        the distant walkers.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

LUKE: (into comlink) All right, boys, keep tight now.

DACK: Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.

LUKE: Steady, Dack. Attack pattern delta. Go now!

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- BATTLEFIELD

           The cannons mounted on the walker head fire at the
        speeders. Other walkers loom in the background. Two speeders
        race away past two of the enormous walkers and bank to the
        right.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

LUKE: All right, I'm coming in.

           He turns his speeder and heads directly at one of the
        walkers, flying toward its towering legs. The horizon twists
        as the speeder banks between the legs.

LUKE: (into comlink) Hobbie, you still with me?

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- BATTLEFIELD

           Two speeders race directly at the head of a walker, then
        split and fly past it.
           Three other walkers march onward, firing all cannons.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- SNOWTRENCH

           Rebel troops fire on the approaching walkers, as the snow
        and ice explode all around them.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- BATTLEFIELD

           A speeder banks through and away from the legs of a walker.
        Two other speeders pass the first speeder from the opposite
        direction. Other Rebel craft race just above the icy plain.
           A giant walker head swivels and fires, striking a
        snowspeeder and sending it crashing in a ball of flames.

INTERIOR: IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER -- COCKPIT

           General Veers and two walker pilots keep a careful eye on
        the racing Rebel snowspeeders as they maneuver their lumbering
        war machine forward.
           Luke's speeder banks in from the side of Veers's walker and
        heads straight for its viewport, blasting away. An explosion
        hits the walker window, but dissipates, doing no harm. The
        speeder roars up and over the impregnable war machine.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

           Luke looks back at the walker as it grows smaller in the
        distance.

LUKE: That armor's too strong for blasters.

           On the horizon, another walker moves up past Luke's cockpit
        window, twisting out of sight as Luke banks and starts another
        run.

LUKE: (into comlink) Rouge Group, use your harpoons and tow cables. Go
for the legs. It might be our only chance of stopping them. (to Dack)
All right, stand by, Dack.

           Dack is at the gunner's controls.

DACK: Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control. I'll have to cut
in the auxiliary.

LUKE: Just hang on. Hang on, Dack. Get ready to fire that tow cable.

           Barely keeping his seat in the tumbling ship, Dack struggles
        to set up his harpoon gun.
           Luke swings his speeder around and heads toward an oncoming
        walker. Laser bolts and flak fill the air, creating a deadly
        obstacle course for the tiny craft.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- BATTLEFIELD

           Rouge Leader and another snowspeeder fly in tight formation
        toward the walker as explosions burst all around them.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

           After sustaining a heavy volley of fire, Luke turns around
        to see if Dack is all right.

LUKE: Dack? Dack!

           Dack is lost. Blood streams down his forehead, which
        rests on his smoldering controls. Out the back window, an
        Imperial walker recedes in the distance.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- SNOW TRENCH AREA

           Rebel troops fire the dishlike ray gun while explosions
        erupt around them.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- BATTLEFIELD

           Two walkers lumber toward the Rebel base as a speeder
        between them explodes in a ball of flames.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- SNOW TRENCH

           The dislike ray gun is hit by a laser bolt and instantly
        explodes.

INTERIOR: IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER -- COCKPIT

           Through the cockpit window, Veers and his pilot can see the
        Rebel power generators in the distance.
           A hologram of Darth Vader appears on a control panel
        screen.

VEERS: Yes, Lord Vader. I've reached the main power generator. The
shield will be down in moments. You may start your landing.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

LUKE: (into comlink) Rouge Three.

WEDGE: (into comlink) Copy, Rouge Leader

LUKE: (over comlink) Wedge, I've lost my gunner. You'll have to make
this shot. I'll cover for you. Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next
pass.

WEDGE: (into comlink) Coming around, Rouge Leader.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

LUKE: (into comlink) Steady, Rouge Two

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           Wedge's speeder races through the legs of one of the
        monstrous walkers.

INTERIOR: WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE THREE -- COCKPIT

WEDGE: (to gunner) Activate harpoon.

           Wedge's gunner reaches for a firing switch to activate the
        harpoon. The harpoon flashes out, and speeds toward the
        receding legs of the walker.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           The harpoon hurtles toward the walker, In an instant it is
        embedded in one of the walker's legs.

INTERIOR: WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE THREE -- COCKPIT

WEDGE: (to gunner) Good shot, Janson.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           The speeder Rouge Three races around one of the giant
        walker's feet, trailing the cable behind it. Continuing around
        the back foot, Rouge Three then circles the walker around the
        tail end.

INTERIOR: WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE THREE -- COCKPIT

           Wedge checks his controls and banks around the front of the
        walker.

WEDGE: One more pass.

JANSON: Coming around. Once more.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           The speeder sweeps left to right in front of the giant
        legs, towing the cable behind it.

INTERIOR: WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE THREE -- COCKPIT

JANSON: One more.

           Wedge swings the speeder between the legs of the giant
        walker.

JANSON: Cable out! Let her go!

WEDGE: Detach cable.

EXTERIOR: WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE THREE

           The cable release on the back of the speeder snaps loose
        and the cable drops away.

INTERIOR: WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE THREE -- COCKPIT

JANSON: Cable detached.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           The speeder zooms away into the distance. The tangled legs
        of the enormous war machine attempt a step, but as they do the
        giant Imperial walker begins to topple. It teeters for a
        moment, and then crashes onto the icy ground, sending snow and
        metal pieces flying.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE PLAIN -- SNOW TRENCH

           The troops in the trenches cheer at the sight of the
        crashing walker.
           An officer gives a signal to his men and Rebel troops
        charge the fallen war machine.

TRENCH OFFICER: Come on!

           The troops run toward the downed walker, followed by two
        Rebel speeders flying overhead. Just as they reach the walker,
        it explodes, the impact throwing some of the men onto the
        frozen ground.

INTERIOR: WEDGE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE THREE -- COCKPIT

           Wedge lets out a triumphant yell, banking his speeder away
        from the fallen walker.

WEDGE: (into comlink) Whooha!! That got him!

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

LUKE: (into comlink) I see it, Wedge. Good work.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- COMMAND CENTER

           Large chunks of ice tumble into the command center as Leia
        and General Rieekan monitor computer screens.

RIEEKAN: I don't think we can protect two transports at a time.

LEIA: It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer. We have no
choice.

RIEEKAN: (into comlink) Launch patrols.

LEIA: (to an aide) Evacuate remaining ground staff.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR

           Muffled distant explosions create widening cracks in the
        ice roof of the hangar. Trying to ignore the noise and falling
        bits of snow, Han works on one of the Falcon's lifters while
        Chewie works on one of the wings. Noticing Chewie attach a
        wrong part, Han grows impatient.

HAN: No, no! No! This one goes there, that one goes there. right?

           In another area of the hangar, Threepio watches as Artoo is
        raised up into Luke's X-wing fighter.

THREEPIO: Artoo, you take good care of Master Luke now, understand?
And...do take care of yourself. Oh, dear, oh, dear.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           The fierce battle on the vast snow plains of Hoth rages on.
        The Imperial walkers continue their slow, steady assault on
        the Rebel base, firing lasers as they lumber ever onward. In
        the snow trench, Rebel troops fire large bazookalike guns and
        dishlike ray guns as explosions erupt around them. A gun tower
        is hit by a laser bolt and instantly explodes. Another blast
        destroys a ray gun.

INTERIOR: IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER -- COCKPIT

           General Veers studies various readouts on his control
        panel.

VEERS: All troops will debark for ground assault. Prepare to target
the main generator.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           Luke's speeder and Rouge Two fly in formation, banking from
        right to left and flying above the erupting battlefield. Flak
        bursts all around them.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

           Luke, glancing over, sees Rouge Two on his left. His ship
        shudders as flak bursts nearby.

LUKE: (into comlink) Rouge Two, are you all right?

LUKE: (over comlink) Stay tight and low.

EXTERIOR: ZEV'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE TWO

           Luke's speeder moves in formation with Rouge Two, when
        suddenly Zev's speeder is hit by a laser bolt. His ship bucks
        violently under the impact and the cockpit explodes in a ball
        of flame.
           Spewing smoke, the speeder hurtles toward a looming walker.
        Before they collide. Rouge Two explodes in a million flaming
        pieces.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S SNOWSPEEDER, ROUGE LEADER -- COCKPIT

           Desperately, Luke works the controls of his flak-buffeted
        ship. Suddenly, the speeder is rocked by a huge explosion.
        Luke struggles with the controls with a look of terror on his
        face. The speeder fills with smoke, and electrical sparks jump
        about the cockpit.

LUKE: (into comlink) Hobbie, I've been hit!

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- COMMAND CENTER

           Apart from the distant thunder of laser blasts, the
        corridor is strangely quiet and empty. Running footsteps echo
        through the freezing hallway, then Han appears. Cracks have
        appeared in some of the walls and some pipes have broken,
        sending hot steam billowing into the underground hallways. Han
        hurries into the command center. It is a shambles, but some
        people are still at their posts. As he enters, a gigantic
        cave-in almost obliterates the room. He finds Leia and
        Threepio near one of the control boards.

HAN: You all right?

           Leia nods. She is surprised to see him.

LEIA: Why are you still here?

HAN: I heard the command center had been hit.

LEIA: You got your clearance to leave.

HAN: Don't worry. I'll leave. First I'm going to get you to your ship.

THREEPIO: Your Highness, we must take this last transport. It's our
only hope.

LEIA: (to controller) Send all troops in sector twelve to the south
slope to protect the fighters.

           A blast rocks the command center, throwing Threepio
        backward into Han's arms.

ANNOUNCER: (over loudspeaker) Imperial troops have entered the base.

HAN: Come on...that's it.

LEIA: (to head controller) Give the evacuation code signal. And get to
your transports!

           Leia looks exhausted. Han grabs her and starts to lead her
        out.
           As Han, Leia, and Threepio run out of the command center,
        the code signal can be heard echoing off the corridor walls.

HEAD CONTROLLER: K-one-zero...all troops disengage.

THREEPIO: (to Han and Leia) Oh! Wait for me!

EXTERIOR: BATTLEFIELD -- SNOW TRENCH

           Rebel troops retreat under the awesome Imperial onslaught.

OFFICER: Begin retreat!

SECOND OFFICER: Fall back!

           Troops flee from the battle, the ground exploding around
        them.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           Three of the giant walkers, firing lasers, advance toward
        the Rebel headquarters.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- SNOW TRENCH

           Continuing their retreat, the Rebels see the walkers
        looming ever nearer.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD -- ICE PLAIN

           On the battlefield, Luke watches as a walker foot rises and
        moves over him. He looks up at the underbelly of the huge
        walker, passing overhead.
           Running beneath the monstrous machine, Luke fires his
        harpoon gun at the walker's underside. A thin cable follows
        the projectile from the gun. The magnetic head and cable
        attach firmly to the metal hull.
           Still running under the walker, Luke attaches the cable
        drum to his belt buckle. Soon he is pulled up the cable and
        hangs dangling underneath the walker.
           The walker's giant feet continue to pound onward across the
        frozen snow. Stray laser bolts whistle by Luke as he climbs up
        the cable to the walker's hull, reaching a small hatch.
        Hanging precariously, Luke cuts the solid metal hatch with his
        laser sword.
           He takes a landmine from around his neck and throws it
        inside the Imperial machine. Quickly, Luke starts down the
        cable and crashes onto the icy ground far below. He lies
        unconscious as a giant rear leg passes by -- and just misses 
        him.
           The giant walker stops in mid-step. A muffled explosion
        comes from within -- and then the walker's mechanical insides 
        are spewed out every conceivable opening. The machine sits
        dead in its tracks, smoking like a locomotive on stilts.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           Veers's walker continues to advance toward the Rebel base.
        The smoldering walker that Luke exploded stands smoking just
        to the right of Veers's path.

INTERIOR: IMPERIAL SNOW WALKER - COCKPIT

           Inside his walker, General Veers prepares to fire on the
        Rebel power generators.

VEERS: Distance to power generators?

PILOT: One-seven, decimal two-eight.

           Veers reaches for the electrorangefinder and lines up the
        main generator.

VEERS: Target. Maximum fire power.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- BATTLEFIELD

           The Rebel troops continue their desperate retreat, pushed
        back by the relentless Imperial assault.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- ICE CORRIDORS

           With Threepio lagging behind, Han and Leia race through the
        crumbling ice corridors. Suddenly, there is an explosion. Han
        turns, grabs the princess, and pulls her to the wall as a
        tremendous cave-in blacks their path.
           He takes the comlink from his pocket.

HAN: (into comlink) Transport, this is Solo. Better take off -- I
can't get to you. I'll get the princess out on the Falcon.

           Han and Leia turn and race down the corridor.

THREEPIO: But...but...but...where are you going? Uh...come back!!

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- COMMAND CENTER

           Imperial troops have reached the base. As they push through
the blocked passageway, Darth Vader strides behind them.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- ICE CORRIDOR

           Han and Leia run toward the entrance of the main hangar
        where the Millennium Falcon is docked. Threepio still lags
        behind.

THREEPIO: Wait! Wait for me! Wait! Stop!

           The door to the hangar closes in his face.

THREEPIO: (exasperated) How typical.

           Quickly, the door reopens as Han reaches out and pulls the
        golden droid through.

HAN: Come on.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR

           Chewie paces under the shelter of the Millennium Falcon's
        landing gear. The giant Wookiee pats the underbelly of his
        beloved ship and barks a few reassuring words. As he searches
        worriedly for his captain, something at last catches his eye.
           Chewie lets out a relieved shriek at seeing Han and Leia
        running toward the ship. The Wookiee runs out into the
        falling ice, lets out a howl, then runs up the ship's ramp.
        Han and Leia run up the ramp after him, closely followed by
        Threepio.

HAN: Hurry up, goldenrod, or you're going to be a permanent resident!

THREEPIO: Wait! Wait!

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- ICE CORRIDOR

           Imperial troops run through the base corridors. Vader
        surveys the place. A huge chunk falls, almost hitting him, but 
        he calmly, purposefully, continues around it.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGER -- MILLENNIUM FALCON

           A distant, huge, explosion rocks the hangar deck. Ice cakes
        come crashing down on the Millennium Falcon.

INTERIOR: MAIN HANGAR -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- MAIN HOLD

           Han, standing before a control panel, is busy flipping
        switches as Chewie watches a troublesome gauge. A worried Leia
        observes their efforts.

HAN: (to Chewie) How's this?

           The Wookiee barks a negative reply.

LEIA: Would it helped if I got out and pushed?

HAN: It might.

           Threepio clanks into the hold.

THREEPIO: Captain Solo, Captain Solo...sir, might I suggest that
you...
        
           Han gives the gold robot a devastating look.

THREEPIO: It can wait.

INTERIOR: MAIN HANGAR -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           They move to the cockpit where Han flips some more
        switches. Leia watches him, impatient, disbelieving.

LEIA: The bucket of bolts is never going to get us past that blockade.

HAN: This baby's got a few surprises left in her, sweetheart.

           Han and Leia look out the cockpit window and see a squad of
        stormtroopers rushing into the far side of the hangar.
           Quickly, Han straps himself into the pilot's seat and Leia
        into the navigator's chair.

INTERIOR: HOTH -- REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR

           Stormtroopers hurriedly set up a large bazookalike weapon.
        Behind them the giant hangar doors open slowly.

EXTERIOR: MAIN HANGAR -- MILLENNIUM FALCON

           A laser gun appears on the Falcon and swings around to aim
        at the Imperial troops.
           The stormtroopers, preparing to fire their bazooka cannon,
        are hit by the Falcon's fire and are thrown about in all
        directions.

INTERIOR: MAIN HANGAR -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Chewie rushes into the cockpit.

HAN: Come on! Come on! Switch over. Let's hope we don't have a
burnout.

           A laser hits the window near Chewie as he is settling into
        his chair. Letting out a loud whelp, Chewie quickly pulls back
        on the controls and the first stage of engine fire can be
        heard. Han flashes a big grin at Leia.

HAN: See?

LEIA: Someday you're going to be wrong, and I hope I'm there to see it.

           Han looks at Chewie.

HAN: Punch it!

           The roar of the Falcon's main engines blasts out everything
        as the ice-cave wall rushes by outside the cockpit window.

INTERIOR: REBEL BASE -- MAIN HANGAR

           More stormtroopers run into the hangar, closely followed by
        Vader. Hearing the loud roar of the Millennium Falcon's
        engines, Vader looks toward the main hangar doors just in time
        to see the Falcon lift up and disappear outside the cave.

EXTERIOR: HOTH -- ICE SLOPE -- DAY

           Luke and two other pilots look up as the Millennium Falcon
        races above them, flying very close to the ground.
           The three pilots turn then, and trudge onward toward their
        X-wing fighters, each going to his own ship. Luke waves
        farewell, then heads toward his own fighter.
           Artoo, seated on his cubbyhole, chirps an excited greeting
        as Luke climbs aboard the spacecraft.

LUKE: Artoo! Get her ready for takeoff.

           From his ship, Luke sees Wedge in his own X-wing, preparing
        for takeoff.

WEDGE: Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.

           Luke smiles and nods at Wedge, then lowers himself into the
        cockpit of his X-wing while Artoo waits in the cubbyhole,
        beeping impatiently.

LUKE: Don't worry, Artoo. We're going, we're going.

           The canopy over the X-wing lowers and snaps shut.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- LUKE'S X-WING

           Luke's fighter, its wings closed, speeds away from the icy
        planet. Soon it disappears into the stars.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT

           Luke, looking thoughtful, suddenly makes a decision. He
        flips several switches. The stars shift as he takes his
        fighter into a steep turn. The X-wing banks sharply and flies
        away in a new direction.
           The monitor screen on Luke's control panel prints out a
        question from the concerned Artoo.

LUKE: (into comlink) There's nothing wrong, Artoo. I'm just setting a
new course.

           Artoo beeps once again.

LUKE: (into comlink) We're not going to regroup with the others.

           Artoo begins a protest, whistling an unbelieving, "What?!"
           Luke reads Artoo's exclamation on his control panel.

LUKE: (into comlink) We're going to the Dagobah system.

           Luke checks his readouts and makes a few adjustments. He
        rides along with only the soft hum of the instruments to break
        the silence. Finally, Artoo chirps up.

LUKE: (into comlink) Yes, Artoo?

           Artoo utters a soft, carefully phrased steam of whistles.

LUKE: (into comlink, chuckling) That's all right. I'd like to keep it
on manual control for a while.

           The little droid lets out a defeated whimper. Luke smiles,
        and continues on his course.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON

           The Millennium Falcon speeds away from Hoth, closely
        followed by one huge Star Destroyer and four tiny TIE
        fighters.
           As it is pursued, the Falcon races toward two very bright
        star-sized objects.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Inside the cockpit, Chewie lets out a loud howl. Han checks
        as the ship is buffeted by exploding flak. He appears to be
        doing six things at once.

HAN: (harried) I saw them! I saw them!

LEIA: Saw what?

HAN: Star Destroyers, two of them, coming right at us.

           Threepio bumps and bangs his way into the cockpit.

THREEPIO: Sir, sir! Might I suggest...

HAN: (to Leia) Shut him up or shut him down! (to Chewie) Check the
deflector shield!

           Chewie barks a reply as he readjusts an overhead switch.

HAN: Oh, great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- STAR DESTROYERS

           The Millennium Falcon races toward one of the huge oncoming
        Star Destroyers. Suddenly, the Falcon starts into a deep dive
        straight down, closely followed by four TIE fighters. The
        underside of the Star Destroyer continues on a collision
        course with two oncoming Star Destroyers. Slowly, it starts
        to veer to the left.

INTERIOR: STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

           Out the front window, the two approaching Star Destroyers
        can be seen veering to the left.

IMPERIAL OFFICER: Take evasive action!

           Alarms sound all over the huge ship. The two other Star
        Destroyers get closer, one of them moving over the bridge so
        close that it makes brushing contact with it.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- TIE FIGHTERS

           The Millennium Falcon races away from the colliding Star
        Destroyers, still followed by four TIE fighters. Laser bolts
        spark the pitch-black skies.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Things have calmed down a bit, but the race isn't over yet.
        Chewie barks at Han. Leia is still trying to recover from the
        steep dive. The ship is buffeted by laser blasts.

HAN: Prepare to make the jump to light-speed.

THREEPIO: But, sir!

           The buffeting of lasers becomes louder and stronger.

LEIA: They're getting closer!

HAN: (with a gleam in his eye) Oh yeah? Watch this.

           Expectantly, they look out the cockpit window as stars do
        not go into hyperspace, but just sit there.
           Han and Chewie look at each other and are thrown into an
        acute state of concern.

LEIA: Watch what?

           Han tries again. Still nothing.

HAN: I think we're in trouble.

THREEPIO: If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier the hyperdrive
motivator has been damaged. It's impossible to go to light-speed!

HAN: We're in trouble!

           The explosions become heavier.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- TIE FIGHTERS -- STAR DESTROYER

           The Falcon races into the starry vastness, followed by the
        four Imperial TIE fighters and an Imperial Star Destroyer.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Stars race by as flak bursts outside the Falcon's window.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- HOLD

           Han works furiously at some control panels while giving
        various orders to Chewie.

HAN: Horizontal boosters...!

           (Chewie barks)

HAN: Alluvial dampers...! Well that's not it.

           (Chewie barks)

HAN: Bring me the hydrospanners!

           Chewie hurries over to the pit and places the tools on the
        edge.

HAN: I don't know how we're going to get out of this one.

           Suddenly, a loud thump hits the side of the Falcon,
        causing it to lurch radically. Chewie barks. The tools fall
        into the pit on top of Han.

HAN: Oww! Chewie!

           More turbulence rocks the ship.

HAN: That was no laser blast! Something hit us.

LEIA: (over comlink) Han, get up here!

HAN: Come on, Chewie!

           Han climbs out of the hold like a shot. Both he and Chewie
        run out of the hold and toward the cockpit.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Out the front cockpit window, they see hundreds of
        asteroids racing by.

LEIA: Asteroids!

           Han changes places with Leia who has been at the controls,
        and Chewie gets into his chair. Han works his controls as a
        chunk of rock crosses in front of the ship.

HAN: Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one.

LEIA: What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid
field?

HAN: They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?

           Another asteroid thumps against the ship and Leia winces at
        the jolt.

LEIA: You don't have to do this to impress me.

THREEPIO: Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid
field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one.

HAN: Never tell me the odds!

EXTERIOR: ASTEROID BELT -- MILLENNIUM FALCON

           The Falcon turns into the asteroid storm and as the ship
        completes its turn, asteroids start coming straight at the
        cockpit windows.
           A large asteroid tumbles away from the Falcon's path at top
        speed. Several smaller asteroids crash into the big one,
        creating small explosions on its surface. Other asteroids of
        all sizes pass by in every direction, some colliding and
        exploding. The tiny Millennium Falcon veers around the big
        asteroid and races past it through the rain of rocks, followed
        by four TIE fighters, which bob and weave around the
        asteroids.
           One of the pursuing TIE fighters connects with an asteroid
        and explodes. The other fighters are pelted with a steady
        stream of smaller explosions.
           Two huge asteroids tumble toward the Millennium Falcon,
        which quickly banks around both of them. The three TIE
        fighters follow in hot pursuit until one of the fighters
        scrapes an asteroid and tumbles out of control into deep
        space.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- STAR DESTROYER -- ASTEROID BELT

           The massive Star Destroyer blasts oncoming asteroids as it
        follows the Falcon. Smaller asteroids explode across its vast
        surface.

EXTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- TIE FIGHTERS -- ASTEROID BELT

           The Falcon twists on its side as it races around an
        oncoming asteroid. Two TIE fighters follow in the distance,
        coming from either side.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Asteroids race by the cockpit window as Han pilots his
        trusty craft through the dangerous field.
           Looking out the cockpit window, the Falcon crew sees a big
        asteroid drop past the window, narrowly missing their ship.
           Chewie barks in terror as a slightly smaller asteroid comes
        especially close -- to close -- and bounces off the Falcon
        with a loud crunch. Threepio's hands cover his eyes. He
        manages a short peek at the cockpit window. Princess Leia sits
        stone-faced, staring at the action. Han gives her a quick
        look.

HAN: You said you wanted to be around when I made a mistake; well,
this could be it, sweetheart.

LEIA: I take it back. We're going to get pulverized if we stay out
here much longer.

           The group watches as more asteroids race by outside the
        window.

HAN: I'm not going to argue with that.

THREEPIO: Pulverized?

HAN: I'm going in closer to one of the big ones.

LEIA: Closer?

THREEPIO: Closer?!

           Chewbacca barks the same word, only louder.

EXTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- ASTEROID BELT

           The Millennium Falcon dives toward the surface of one of
        the moon-sized asteroids. There is a continued display of
        explosions against the starry void as smaller asteroids
        collide with larger chunks of rock. The two remaining TIE
        fighters follow the Falcon to the large asteroid. The Falcon
        skims the surface of the giant asteroid as, all the while,
        small asteroids explode on the surface of the ship.
           The TIE fighters approach the Falcon, but a giant asteroid
        hurtles directly into their path. As the asteroid continues on
        its way, it leaves remains of the two exploded TIE fighters to
        tumble into deep space.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Rattled by the violent rocking of the starship, Threepio is
        nearly in hysterics.

THREEPIO: Oh, this is suicide!

           Han notices something on his main scope and nudges his
        faithful Wookiee, pointing.

HAN: There. That looks pretty good.

LEIA: What looks pretty good?

HAN: Yeah. That'll do nicely.

THREEPIO: (to Leia) Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?

           Out the cockpit window, they see that they are skimming the
        surface of the enormous asteroid and nearing a large crater.

EXTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

           The Millennium Falcon dives into the huge crater and
        disappears.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

LEIA: I hope you know what you're doing.

HAN: Yeah, me too.

INTERIOR: GIANT ASTEROID CRATER

           The Falcon races down into the crater. The walls are barely
        visible as the ship speed through the tunnellike opening. A
        small cave appears on one side of the crater, and the Falcon
        turns, slows, and scoots into it.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- LUKE'S X-WING

           The tiny X-wing speeds toward the cloud cover of Dagobah.
        Artoo, riding on the back of the fighter, turns his head back
        and forth with some anxiety.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT

           Luke watches Artoo's words as they are translated and
        screened on the computer scope.

LUKE: (into comlink) Yes, that's it. Dagobah.

           Artoo beeps a hopeful inquiry.

LUKE: (into comlink) No, I'm not going to change my mind about this.
(getting a little nervous) I'm not picking up any cities or
technology. Massive life-form readings, though. There's something
alive down there...

           Artoo beeps, this time a slightly worried question.

LUKE: (into comlink) Yes, I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- DAGOBAH -- LUKE'S X-WING

           The X-wing continues its flight through the twilight above
        the cloud-covered planet.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT

           Luke sees the cloud race by as he takes his craft closer
        to the planet. He must operate his controls carefully since
        the cloud cover has completely obscured his vision. An alarm
        buzzes in the background, Artoo beeps and whistles
        frantically.

LUKE: (into comlink) I know, I know! All the scopes are dead. I can't
see a thing! Just hang on, I'm going to start the landing cycle...

           The blast of the retrorockets is deafening, drowning out
        Artoo's electronic squeals. Suddenly, there is a cracking
        sound as if limbs were being broken off trees and then a
        tremendous jolt as the spacecraft stops. Luke pulls a switch
        and his canopy pops open.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- DUSK

           The mist-shrouded X-wing fighter is almost invisible in the
        thick fog. Luke climbs out onto the long nose of the
        spacecraft as Artoo pops out of his cubbyhole on the back. The
        young warrior surveys the fog, which is barely pierced by the
        ship's landing lights. About all he can make out are some
        giant, twisted trees nearby. Artoo whistles anxiously.

LUKE: No, Artoo, you stay put. I'll have a look around.

           Artoo lets out a short beep. As Luke moves along the nose,
        Artoo loses his balance and disappears with a splash into the
        boggy lake.

LUKE: Artoo?

           Luke kneels and leans over the plane looking for Artoo, but
        the water is still and reveals no sign of the little droid.

LUKE: Artoo! Where are you?

           A small periscope breaks the surface of the water and a
        gurgly beep is heard. The periscope starts to move to shore.
        Relieved, Luke starts running along the nose of the fighter to
        its tip.

LUKE: Artoo! You be more careful.

           The outline of the shore is now more than ten feet away.
        Luke jumps off the plane into the water, scrambles up to the
        shore, and turns to look for Artoo. The periscope still
        steadily moves toward shore.

LUKE: Artoo -- that way!

           Suddenly, through the thick fog layer, a dark shape
        appears, moving toward the little droid. The dark, sinuous bog
        beast dives beneath the swampy water, making a loud clunk
        against Artoo's metal hull. The droid disappears from sight,
        uttering a pathetic electronic scream.
           Holding his ignited lightsaber before him, Luke wades a few
        feet into the murky pool, looking for any sign of his little
        friend.

LUKE: Artoo!

           The black surface is still as death itself...until a few
        bubbles begin to appear. Then, phheewaat!! The runt-size robot
        is spit out of the water, makes a graceful arc, and comes
        crashing down into a patch of soft gray moss.

LUKE: Oh, no! Are you all right? Come on. You're lucky you don't taste
very good. Anything broken?

           Luke helps Artoo to his feet and begins wiping the mud and
        roots from his round metal body. Artoo responds with feeble,
        soggy beeps.

LUKE: If you're saying coming here was a bad idea, I'm beginning to
agree with you. Oh, Artoo, what are we doing here? It's like...
something out of a dream, or, I don't know. Maybe I'm just going
crazy.

           As Luke glances around at the spooky swamp jungle that
        surrounds him, Artoo ejects a stream of muddy water from one
        of his cranial ports.

EXTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- VADER'S CHAMBER

           Admiral Piett hesitates in the entryway to Vader's private
        cubicle. After a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at
        the surprising sight before him.
           Darth Vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom
        on the far side of the chamber. A black, insectlike droid
        attends him. Among the various apparatuses surrounding them, a
        respirator tube now retracts from Vader's uncovered head. The
        head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it. The
        black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto Vader's head.
        When it is in place, the Dark Lord turns to face Piett.

VADER: Yes, Admiral?

PIETT: Our ships have sighted the Millennium Falcon, lord. But...it
has entered an asteroid field and we cannot risk...

VADER: (interrupting) Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral. I want
that ship and not excuses.

PIETT: Yes, lord.

EXTERIOR: ASTEROID CAVE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON

           The pirate starship rests in a dark, dripping asteroid
        cave. It is so dark that the cave's exact dimensions are
        impossible to determine.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Han and Chewie busily shut down the engine and all
        electronic systems. Threepio and Leia watch worriedly.

HAN: I'm going to shut down everything but the emergency power
systems. 

THREEPIO: Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but...does that include
shutting me down, too?

           Chewie barks "yes". But Han thinks otherwise.

HAN: No, I need you to talk to the Falcon, find out what's wrong with
the hyperdrive.

           Suddenly, the ship lurches, causing all the loose items in
        the cockpit to go flying. Chewie howls.

THREEPIO: Sir, it's quite possible this asteroid is not entirely
stable.

HAN: Not entirely stable? I'm glad you're here to tell us these
things.  Chewie, take the professor in the back and plug him into the
hyperdrive.

THREEPIO: Oh! Sometimes I just don't understand human behavior. After
all, I'm only trying to do my job in the most...

           The sliding door closes behind the indignant Threepio as
        Chewie and he move back to the hold. Suddenly, the ship
        lurches again, throwing Leia across the cabin into Han's arms.
        Then, abruptly, the motion stops as suddenly as it started.
        With some surprise, Han and Leia realize they are in each
        other's arms.

LEIA: Let go.

HAN: Sshh!

LEIA: Let go, please.

           Leia flushes, averting her eyes. She's not exactly fighting
        to get free. But, of course, Han blows it...

HAN: Don't get excited.

           The anger rises in Leia.

LEIA: Captain, being held by you isn't quite enough to get me excited.

HAN: Sorry, sweetheart. We haven't got time for anything else.

           Han grins quickly wickedly at Leia as he turns and exits
        through the door. Leia's confused emotions show clearly on her
        lovely face.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- BOG CLEARING -- DUSK

           The mist has dispersed a bit, but it is still a very
        gloomy-looking swamp.
           Luke pulls an equipment box from the shore to the clearing.
        He ignites a little fusion furnace and warms his hands before
        it. Taking a power cable, he plugs it into Artoo's noselike
        socket.

LUKE: Ready for some power? Okay. Let's see now. Put that in there.
There you go.

           The droid whistles his appreciation. Luke then opens a
        container of processed food and sits before the thermal
        heater.

LUKE: (sighs) Now all I have to do is find this Yoda...if he even
exists.

           Nervously, he looks around at the foreboding jungle.

LUKE: Still...there's something familiar about this place. I feel
like...I don't know...

STRANGE VOICE: Feel like what?

           Luke jumps out of his skin. Artoo screeches in terror. The
        young warrior grabs for his lightsaber as he spins around,
        looking for the speaker. Mysteriously standing right in front
        of Luke is a strange, bluish creature, not more than two feet
        tall. The wizened little thing is dressed in rags. It motions
        toward Luke's sword.

LUKE: (looking at the creature) Like we're being watched!

CREATURE: Away with your weapon! I mean you no harm.

           After some hesitation, Luke puts away his weapon, although
        he really doesn't understand why. Artoo watches with interest.

CREATURE: I am wondering, why are you here?

LUKE: I'm looking for someone.

CREATURE: Looking? Found someone, you have, I would say, hmmm?

           The little creature laughs.

LUKE: (Trying to keep from smiling) Right.

CREATURE: Help you I can. Yes, mmmm.

LUKE: I don't think so. I'm looking for a great warrior.

CREATURE: Ahhh! A great warrior. (laughs and shakes his head) Wars not
make one great.

           With the aid of a walking stick, the tiny stranger moves
        over to one of the cases of supplies. He begins to rummage
        around.
           Artoo moves to the edge of the case -- standing almost eye
        level to the creature who is carelessly handling the supplies
        -- and squeaks his disapproval.
           Their tiny visitor pick up the container of food Luke was
        eating from and takes a bite.

LUKE: Put that down. Hey! That's my dinner.

           The creature spits out the bite he has taken. He makes a
        face.

CREATURE: How you get so big, eating food of this kind?

           He flips the container in Luke's direction and reaches into
        one of Luke's supply cases.

LUKE: Listen, friend, we didn't mean to land in that puddle, and if we
could get our ship out, we would, but we can't, so why don't you
just...

CREATURE: (teasing) Aww, cannot get your ship out?

           The creature spots something of interest in Luke's case.
        Luke loses patience and grabs the case away. The creature
        retains his prize -- a tiny power lamp -- and examines it with
        delight.

LUKE: Hey, you could have broken this. Don't do that. Ohhh...you're
making a mess. Hey, give me that!

CREATURE: (retreating with the lamp) Mine! Or I will help you not.

           Clutching its treasure, the creature backs away from Luke,
        drawing closer to Artoo. As Luke and the creature argue, one
        of Artoo's little arms slowly moves out toward the power lamp,
        completely unnoticed by the creature.

LUKE: I don't want your help. I want my lamp back. I'll need it to get
out of this slimy mudhole.

CREATURE: Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.

           Artoo grabs hold of the lamp and the two little figures are
        immediately engaged in a tug-of-war over it.
           Artoo beeps a few angry, "Give me thats."

CREATURE: Ah, ah, ah!

LUKE: Oh, Artoo, let him have it.

CREATURE: Mine! Mine!

LUKE: Artoo!

CREATURE: Mine!

           The creature lets go with one hand and pokes Artoo lightly
        with one finger. Artoo reacts with a startled squeal, and lets
        go.

CREATURE: Mine!

LUKE: (fed up) Now will you move along, little fella? We're got a lot
of work to do.

CREATURE: No! No, no! Stay and help you, I will. (laughs) Find your
friend, hmm?

LUKE: I'm not looking for a friend, I'm looking for a Jedi Master.

CREATURE: Oohhh. Jedi Master. Yoda. You seek Yoda.

LUKE: You know him?

CREATURE: Mmm. Take you to him, I will. (laughs) Yes, yes. But now, we
must eat. Come. Good food. Come.

           With that, the creature scurries out of the clearing,
        laughing merrily. Luke stares after him. All he sees is the
        faint light from the small power lamp moving through the fog.
        Luke makes his decision and starts after the creature.

CREATURE: (in the distance) Come, come.

           Artoo, very upset, whistles a blue streak of protest.

LUKE: Stay here and watch after the camp, Artoo.

           Artoo beeps even more frantically. But as Luke disappears
        from view, the worried little droid grows quieter, and utters
        a soft electronic sigh.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- MAIN HOLD AREA

           Threepio whistles and beeps a strange dialect into the
        control panel in front of him. The control panel whistles back
        a few mystifying beeps.

THREEPIO: Oh, where is Artoo when I need him?

           Han enters the hold area and kneels on the floor near the
        control box.

THREEPIO: Sir, I don't know where your ship learned to communicate,
but it has the most peculiar dialect. I believe, sir, it says that the
power coupling on the negative axis has been polarized. I'm afraid
you'll have to replace it.

HAN: Well, of course I'll have to replace it.

           He hands a wire coil up to Chewie who is working near the
        ceiling.

HAN: Here! And Chewie...

           Chewie brings his head back through the trap door in the
        ceiling and whines. Han glances back at Threepio, then speaks
        quietly to Chewie so only he can hear.

HAN: (continued)...I think we'd better replace the negative power
coupling.

           Leia finishes welding the valves she has been working on
        and attempts to reengage the system by pulling a lever
        attached to the valve. It doesn't budge. Han notices her
        struggle, and moves to help her. She rebuffs him.

HAN: Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.

LEIA: (still struggling) Would you please stop calling me that?

           Han hears a new tone in her voice. He watches her pull on
        the lever.

HAN: Sure, Leia.

LEIA: Oh, you make it so difficult sometimes.

HAN: I do, I really do. You could be a little nicer, though. (he
watches her reaction) Come on, admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all
right.

           She lets go of the lever and rubs her sore hand.

LEIA: Occasionally (a little smile, haltingly) maybe...when you aren't
acting like a scoundrel.

HAN: (laughs) Scoundrel? Scoundrel? I like the sound of that.

           With that, Han takes her hand and starts to massage it.

LEIA: Stop that.

HAN: Stop what?

           Leia is flushes, confused.

LEIA: Stop that! My hands are dirty.

HAN: My hands are dirty, too. What are you afraid of?

LEIA: (looking right into his eyes) Afraid?

           Han looks at her with a piercing look. He's never looked
        more handsome, more dashing, more confident. He reaches out
        slowly and takes Leia's hand again from where it is resting
        on a console. He draws it toward him.

HAN: You're trembling.

LEIA: I'm not trembling.

           Then with an irresistible combination of physical strength
        and emotional power, the space pirate begins to draw Leia
        toward him...very slowly.

HAN: You like me because I'm a scoundrel. There aren't enough
scoundrels in your life.

           Leia is now very close to Han and as she speaks, her voice
        becomes an excited whisper, a tone completely in opposition to
        her words.

LEIA: I happen to like nice men.

HAN: I'm a nice man.

LEIA: No, you're not. You're...

           He kisses her now, with slow, hot lips. He takes his time,
        as though he had forever, bending her body backward. She has
        never been kissed like this before, and it almost makes her
        faint. When he stops, she regains her breath and tries to work
        up some indignation, but finds it hard to talk.
           Suddenly, Threepio appears in the doorway, speaking
        excitedly.

THREEPIO: Sir, sir! I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.

           Han turns slowly, icily, from their embrace.

HAN: Thank you. Thank you very much.

THREEPIO: Oh, you're perfectly welcome, sir.

           The moment spoiled, Han marches out after Threepio.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- ASTEROID FIELD

           The Imperial fleet moves through the asteroid-filled void,
        intently seeking its prey.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

           Asteroids collide, creating a fireworks display outside the
        bridge window. Darth Vader stands, staring out the window
        above the control deck. Then slowly turns toward the bridge.
        Before him are the hologram images of twenty battleship
        commanders. One of these images, the commander of a ship that
        has just exploded, is fading away quickly. Another image, in
        the center and a little apart from the others, is faded and
        continually disrupted by static. It is the image of Captain
        Needa, commander of the Star Destroyer most hotly on the tail
        of the Millennium Falcon. Admiral Piett and an aide stand
        behind the Dark Lord.

NEEDA: (in hologram)...and that, Lord Vader, was the last time they
appeared in any of our scopes. Considering the amount of damage we've
sustained, they must have been destroyed.

VADER: No, Captain, they're alive. I want every ship available to
sweep the asteroid field until they are found.

           The Imperial star captains fade out one by one as Vader
        turns to Admiral Piett.

PIETT: Lord Vader.

VADER: Yes, Admiral, what is it?

           The admiral is scared, his face white as a sheet.

PIETT: The Emperor commands you make contact with him.

VADER: Move the ship out of the asteroid field so that we can send a
clear transmission.

PIETT: Yes, my lord.

EXTERIOR: ASTEROID FIELD -- VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

           Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves against the vast sea
        of stars away from the rest of the fleet.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- VADER'S CHAMBER

           The Dark Lord, Darth Vader, is alone in his chamber. A
        strange sound enters the room and a light begins to play
        across Vader's black figure. He looks up and bows quickly.
           A twelve-foot hologram of the Galactic Emperor materializes
        before Vader. The Emperor's dark robes and monk's hood are
        reminiscent of the cloak worn by Ben Kenobi. His voice is even
        deeper and more frightening than Vader's.

VADER: What is thy bidding, my master?

EMPEROR: There is a great disturbance in the Force.

VADER: I have felt it.

EMPEROR: We have a new enemy -- Luke Skywalker.

VADER: Yes, my master.

EMPEROR: He could destroy us.

VADER: He's just a boy. Obi-Wan can no longer help him.

EMPEROR: The Force is strong with him. The son of Skywalker must not
become a Jedi.

VADER: If he could be turned, he would become a powerful ally.

EMPEROR: Yes. Yes. He would be a great asset. Can it be done?

VADER: He will join us or die, my master.

           Vader kneels. The supreme Emperor passes a hand over the
        crouched Lord of the Sith and fades away.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- CREATURE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT

           A heavy downpour of rain pounds through the gnarled trees.
        A strange baroque mud house sits on a moss-covered knoll on
        the edge of a small lagoon. The small, gnomish structure
        radiates a warm glow from its thick glass windows. As rain
        tap-dances a merry tune on Artoo's head, the stubby little
        droid rises up on his tip-toes to peek into one of the glowing
        portals.

INTERIOR: CREATURE'S HOUSE

           Artoo, peeking in the window, sees the inside of the house
        -- a very plain, but cozy dwelling. Everything is in the same
        small scale as the creature. The only thing out of place in
        the miniature room is Luke, whose height makes the four-foot
        ceiling seem even lower. He sits cross-legged on the floor of
        the living room.
           The creature is in an adjoining area -- his little kitchen
        -- cooking up an incredible meal. The stove is a steaming
        hodgepodge of pots and pans. The wizened little host scurries
        about chopping this, shredding that, and showering everything
        with exotic herbs and spices. He rushes back and forth putting
        platters on the table in front of Luke, who watches the
        creature impatiently.

LUKE: Look, I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't understand why we
can't see Yoda now.

CREATURE: Patience! For the Jedi it is time to eat as well. Eat, eat.
Hot. Good food, hm? Good, hmm?

           Moving with some difficulty in the cramped quarters, Luke
        sits down near the fire and serves himself from the pot.
        Tasting the unfamiliar concoction, he is pleasantly surprised.

LUKE: How far away is Yoda? Will it take us long to get there?

CREATURE: Not far. Yoda not far. Patience. Soon you will be with him.
(tasting food from the pot) Rootleaf, I cook. Why wish you become
Jedi? Hm?

LUKE: Mostly because of my father, I guess.

CREATURE: Ah, your father. Powerful Jedi was he, powerful Jedi, mmm.

LUKE: (a little angry) Oh, come on. How could you know my father? You
don't even know who I am. (fed up) Oh, I don't even know what I'm
doing here. We're wasting our time.

           The creature turns away from Luke and speaks to a third
        party.

CREATURE: (irritated) I cannot teach him. The boy has no patience.

           Luke's head spins in the direction the creature faces. But
        there is no one there. The boy is bewildered, but it gradually
        dawns on him that the little creature is Yoda, the Jedi
        Master, and that he is speaking with Ben.

BEN'S VOICE: He will learn patience.

YODA: Hmmm. Much anger in him, like his father.

BEN'S VOICE: Was I any different when you taught me?

YODA: Hah. He is not ready.

LUKE: Yoda! I am ready. I...Ben! I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm
ready.

           Trying to see Ben, Luke starts to get up but hits his head
        on the low ceiling.

YODA: Ready, are you? What know you of ready? For eight hundred years
have I trained Jedi. My own counsel will I keep on who is to be
trained! A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, the most serious
mind. (to the invisible Ben, indicating Luke) This one a long time
have I watched. Never his mind on where he was. Hmm? What he was
doing. Hmph. Adventure. Heh! Excitement. Heh! A Jedi craves not these
things. (turning to Luke) You are reckless!

           Luke looks down. He knows it is true.

BEN'S VOICE: So was I, if you'll remember.

YODA: He is too old. Yes, too old to begin the training.

           Luke thinks he detects a subtle softening in Yoda's voice.

LUKE: But I've learned so much.

           Yoda turns his piercing gaze on Luke, as though the Jedi
        Master's huge eyes could somehow determine how much the boy
        had learned. After a long moment, the little Jedi turns toward
        where he alone sees Ben.

YODA: (sighs) Will he finished what he begins?

LUKE: I won't fail you -- I'm not afraid.

YODA: (turns slowly toward him) Oh, you will be. You will be.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- STAR DESTROYERS -- ASTEROID FIELD

           The Imperial fleet around Vader's ship is surrounded by the
        asteroid storm. Asteroids big and small pelt the vast
        exteriors of the menacing ships. One of the smaller Imperial
        vessels is hit by a huge asteroid and explodes in a brilliant
        flash of light.

INTERIOR: ASTEROID CAVE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           The cockpit is quiet and lit only by the indicator lights
        on the control panel. Princess Leia sits in the pilot's seat.
        She runs her hand across the control panel as she thinks of
        Han and the confusion he has created within her. Suddenly,
        something outside the cockpit window catches her eye. The
        reflection of the panel lights obscures her vision until a
        soft suctionlike cup attaches itself to the windscreen. Leia
        moves closer to see what it might be. Large, yellow eyes flash
        open and stare back at her. Startled, she jumps back into her
        seat, her heart pounding. There is a scurry of feet and a loud
        screech, and in an instant the eyes are gone. The young
        princess catches her breath, jumps out of her chair, and races
        from the cockpit.

INTERIOR: ASTEROID CAVE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- HOLD AREA

           The lights go bright for a second then out again. Threepio
        and Chewbacca watch as Han finishes with some wires.

THREEPIO: Sir, if I may venture an opinion...

HAN: I'm not really interested in your opinion, Threepio.

           Leia rushes into the cabin just as Han drops the final
        floor panel into place.

LEIA: (out of breath) There's something out there.

HAN: Where?

LEIA: Outside, in the cave.

           As she speaks, there comes a sharp banging on the hull.
        Chewie looks up and barks anxiously.

THREEPIO: There it is. Listen! Listen!

HAN: I'm going out there.

LEIA: Are you crazy?!

HAN: I just got this bucket back together. I'm not going to let
something tear it apart.

           He and Chewie grab their breath masks off a rack and hurry
        out. Leia follows.

LEIA: Then I'm going with you.

THREEPIO: I think it might be better if I stay here and guard the
ship. (hears another mysterious noise) Oh, no.

EXTERIOR: ASTEROID CAVE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON

           It is very dark inside the huge asteroid cave, too dark to
        see what is attacking the ship.
           Leia stamps her foot on the floor of the cave.

LEIA: This ground sure feels strange. It doesn't feel like rock at
all.

           Han kneels and studies the ground, then attempts to study
        the outline of the cave.

HAN: There's an awful lot of moisture in here.

LEIA: I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.

HAN: Yeah.

           Chewie barks through his face mask, and points toward the
        ship's cockpit. A five-foot-long shape can be seen moving
        across the top of the Falcon. The leathery creature lets out a
        screech as Han blasts it with a laser bolt.

HAN: (to Leia) Watch out!

           The black shape tumbles off the spaceship and onto the
        ground in front of the princess. Han bends down to investigate
        the dead creature.

HAN: Yeah, that's what I thought. Mynock. Chewie, check the rest of
the ship, make sure there aren't any more attached. They're chewing on
the power cables.

LEIA: Mynocks?

HAN: Go on inside. We'll clean them off if there are any more.

           Just then, a swarm of the ugly creatures swoops through the
        air. Leia puts her arms over her head to protect herself as
        she runs toward the ship. Chewie shoos another Mynock away
        with his blaster. Several of the batlike creatures flap their
        wings loudly against the cockpit window of the Falcon. Inside,
        Threepio shudders at their presence.

THREEPIO: Ohhh! Go away! Go away! Beastly thing. Shoo! Shoo!

           Han looks around the strange, dripping cave.

HAN: Wait a minute...

           He unholsters his blaster and fires at the far side of the
        huge cave. The cavern begins to shake and the ground starts to
        buckle.
           Chewie barks and moves for the ship, followed closely by
        Leia and Han. The large wings of the Mynocks flap past them as
        they protect their faces and run up the platform.

INTERIOR: ASTEROID CAVE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- ENTRY AREA

           As soon as Han and Leia are on board, Chewie closes the
        main hatch. The ship continues to shake and heave.

HAN: All right, Chewie, let's get out of here!

           The Wookiee heads for the cockpit as Han, followed by
        Threepio, rushes to the hold area and checks the scopes on the
        control panel. Leia hurries after.

LEIA: The Empire is still out there. I don't think it's wise to...

           Han rushes past her and heads for the cockpit.

HAN: (interrupting) No time to discuss this as a committee.

           And with that he is gone. The main engines of the Falcon
        begin to whine. Leia races after him, bouncing around in the
        shaking ship.

LEIA: (angry) I am not a committee!

INTERIOR: ASTEROID CAVE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Han is already in the pilot's seat pulling back on the
        throttle. The cave-quake has greatly diminished.

LEIA: You can't make the jump to light-speed in this asteroid field...

HAN: Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off!

           As the ship begins to move forward, Chewie barks. He
        notices something out the window ahead. Threepio sees it too.

THREEPIO: Look!

HAN: I see it, I see it.

           Suddenly, a row of jagged white stalagmites and stalactites
        can be seen surrounding the entrance. And as the Falcon moves
        forward, the entrance to the cave grows ever smaller. Han
        pulls hard on the throttle, sending his ship surging forward.

THREEPIO: We're doomed!

LEIA: The cave is collapsing.

HAN: This is no cave.

LEIA: What?

           Leia's mouth drops open . She sees that the rocks of the
        cave entrance are not rocks at all, but giant teeth, quickly
        closing around the tiny ship. Chewie howls.

INTERIOR: SPACE SLUG MOUTH

           The Millennium Falcon, zooming through the monster's mouth,
        rolls on its side and barely makes it between two of the
        gigantic white teeth before the huge jaws slams closed.

EXTERIOR: CAVE ENTRANCE -- GIANT ASTEROID

           The enormous space slug moves its head out of the cave as
        the Falcon flies out of its mouth. The monster tilts its head,
        watching the starship fly away.

EXTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- GIANT ASTEROID

           The Falcon races out of the asteroid crater and into the
        deadly rain of the asteroid storm.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- DAY

           With Yoda strapped to his back, Luke climbs up one of the
        many thick vines that grow in the swamp. Panting heavily, he
        continues his course -- climbing, flipping through the air,
        jumping over roots, and racing in and out of the heavy ground
        fog.

YODA: Run! Yes. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware of
the dark side. Anger...fear...aggression. The dark side of the Force
are they. Easily they flow, quick to join you in a fight. If once you
start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny,
consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.

LUKE: Vader. Is the dark side stronger?

YODA: No...no...no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.

LUKE: But how am I to know the good side from the bad?

YODA: You will know. When you are calm, at peace. Passive. A Jedi uses
the Force for knowledge and defense, never for attack.

LUKE: But tell me why I can't...

YODA: (interrupting) No, no, there is no why. Nothing more will I
teach you today. Clear your mind of questions. Mmm. Mmmmmm.

           Artoo beeps in the distance as Luke lets Yoda down to the
        ground. Breathing heavily, he takes his shirt from a nearby
        tree branch and pulls it on.
           He turns to see a huge, dead, black tree, its base
        surrounded by a few feet of water. Giant, twisted roots form a
        dark and sinister cave on one side. Luke stares at the tree,
        trembling.

LUKE: There's something not right here.

           Yoda sits on a large root, poking his Gimer Stick into the
        dirt.

LUKE: I feel cold, death.

YODA: That place...is strong with the dark side of the Force. A domain
of evil it is. In you must go.

LUKE: What's in there?

YODA: Only what you take with you.

           Luke looks warily between the tree and Yoda. He starts to
        strap on his weapon belt.

YODA: Your weapons...you will not need them.

           Luke gives the tree a long look, than shakes his head "no."
        Yoda shrugs. Luke reaches up to brush aside some hanging vines
        and enters the tree.

INTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- TREE CAVE

           Luke moves into the almost total darkness of the wet and
        slimy cave. The youth can barely make out the edge of the
        passage. Holding his lit saber before him, he sees a lizard
        crawling up the side of the cave and a snake wrapped around
        the branches of a tree. Luke draws a deep breath, then pushes
        deeper into the cave.
           The space widens around him, but he feels that rather than
        sees it. His sword casts the only light as he peers into the
        darkness. It is very quiet here.
           Then, a loud hiss! Darth Vader appears across the
        blackness, illuminated by his own just-ignited laser sword.
        Immediately, he charges Luke, saber held high. He is upon the
        youth in seconds, but Luke sidesteps perfectly and slashes at
        Vader with his sword.
           Vader is decapitated. His helmet-encased head flies from
        his shoulders as his body disappears into the darkness. The
        metallic banging of the helmet fills the cave as Vader's head
        spins and bounces, smashes on the floor, and finally stops.
        For an instant it rests on the floor, then it cracks
        vertically. The black helmet and breath mask fall away to
        reveal...Luke's head.
           Across the space, the standing Luke gasps at the sight,
        wide-eyed in terror.
           The decapitated head fades away, as in a vision.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- CAVE -- DUSK

           Meanwhile, Yoda sits on the root, calmly leaning on his
        Gimer Stick.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- VADER'S STAR DESTROYER

           Vader's Imperial Star Destroyer moves through space,
        guarded by its convoy of TIE fighters.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE -- CONTROL DECK

           Vader stands in the back control area of his ship's bridge
        with a motley group of men and creatures. Admiral Piett and
        two controllers stand at the front of the bridge and watch the
        group with scorn.

PIETT: Bounty hunters. We don't need that scum.

FIRST CONTROLLER: Yes, sir.

PIETT: Those Rebels won't escape us.

           A second controller interrupts.

SECOND CONTROLLER: Sir, we have a priority signal from the Star
Destroyer Avenger.

PIETT: Right.

           The group standing before Vader is a bizarre array of
        galactic fortune hunters: There is Bossk, a slimy, tentacled
        monster with two huge, bloodshot eyes in a soft baggy face;
        Zuckuss and Dengar, two battle-scarred, mangy human types;
        IG-88, a battered, tarnished chrome war droid; and Boba Fett,
        a man in a weapon-covered armored space suit.

VADER: ...there will be a substantial reward for the one who finds
the Millennium Falcon. You are free to use any methods necessary, but
I want them alive. No disintegrations.

BOBA FETT: As you wish.

           At that moment, Admiral Piett approaches Vader in a rush of
        excitement.

PIETT: Lord Vader! My lord, we have them.

EXTERIOR: IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER -- ASTEROID BELT

           The Millennium Falcon speeds through deep space, closely
        followed by a firing Imperial Star Destroyer. A large asteroid
        about the same size as the Falcon tumbles rapidly toward the
        starship. The tiny Falcon banks to avoid the giant asteroid as
        smaller rocks pelt its surface. Then the small craft roars
        under the asteroid which explodes harmlessly on the hull of
        the vast Star Destroyer.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           The ship shudders as flak explodes near the cockpit window.
        Threepio checks a tracking scope an the side control panel
        while Leia watches tensely out the window.

THREEPIO: Oh, thank goodness we're coming out of the asteroid field.

           Chewie barks excitedly as the rain of asteroids begins to
        subside. A bolt from the Star Destroyer sets up a fiery
        explosion on the back side of the Falcon, causing it to lurch
        to one side.

EXTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER -- ASTEROID FIELD

           The Falcon is hit hard by another bolt from the Star
        Destroyer which creates a huge explosion near the cockpit of
        the smaller ship. The Falcon tilts steeply, then rights
        itself.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Han corrects the angle of his ship.

HAN: Let's get out of here. Ready for light-speed? One...two...three!

           Han pulls back on the hyperspace throttle and -- nothing
        happens. Flak bursts continue to rock the ship.

HAN: (frantic) It's not fair!

           Chewie is very angry and starts to growl and bark at his
        friend and captain. Again, Han desperately pulls back on the
        throttle.

HAN: The transfer circuits are working. It's not my fault!

           Chewie puts his head in his hands, whining.

LEIA: (almost expecting it) No light-speed?

HAN: It's not my fault.

THREEPIO: Sir, we just lost the main rear deflector shield. One more
direct hit on the back quarter and we're done for.

           Han pauses for a moment, makes a decision, and pulls back
        on a lever.

HAN: Turn her around.

           Chewie barks in puzzlement.

HAN: I said turn her around! I'm going to put all power in the front
shield.

LEIA: You're going to attack them?!

THREEPIO: Sir, the odds of surviving a direct assault on an Imperial
Star Destroyer...

LEIA: Shut up!

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- ASTEROID FIELD

           The Falcon banks, makes a steep, twisting turn. In the
        next moment it is racing toward the Star Destroyer, looking
        very small against the massive surface of the Imperial ship.
        As it moves across the surface of the Star Destroyer, the
        Falcon bobs and weaves to avoid the numerous flak bursts.

INTERIOR: STAR DESTROYER, AVENGER -- BRIDGE

           The tiny Falcon heads directly for the Avenger's bridge.
        The Imperials stationed there are stunned to see the small
        spaceship racing low across the hull, headed directly at the
        huge windows of the bridge area. Alarms go off everywhere. The
        Destroyer's commander, Captain Needa, can scarcely believe his
        eyes.

NEEDA: They're moving to attack position. Shields up!

           Needa and his men duck as the Falcon nears the bridge
        window. At the last minute, the Falcon veers off and out of
        sight. All is quiet.

NEEDA: Track them,. They may come around for another pass.

TRACKING OFFICER: Captain Needa, the ship no longer appears on our
scopes.

NEEDA: They can't have disappeared. No ship that small has a cloaking
device.

TRACKING OFFICER: Well, there's no trace of them, sir.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Captain, Lord Vader demands an update on the
pursuit.

NEEDA: (drawing a breath) Get a shuttle ready. I shall assume full
responsibility for losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader.
Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.

COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER: Yes, Captain Needa.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- BOG -- DAY

           Luke's face is upside-down and showing enormous strain. He
        stands on his hands, with Yoda perched on his feet. Opposite
        Luke and Yoda are two rocks the size of bowling balls. Luke
        stares at the rocks and concentrates. One of the rocks lifts
        from the ground and floats up to rest on the other.

YODA: Use the Force. Yes...

           Yoda taps Luke's leg. Quickly, Luke lifts one hand from the
        ground. His body wavers, but he maintains his balance. Artoo,
        standing nearby, is whistling and beeping frantically.

YODA: Now...the stone. Feel it.

           Luke concentrates on trying to lift the top rock. It rises
        a few feet, shaking under the strain. But, distracted by
        Artoo's frantic beeping, Luke loses his balance and finally
        collapses. Yoda jumps clear.

YODA: Concentrate!

           Annoyed at the disturbance, Luke looks over at Artoo, who
        is rocking urgently back and forth in front of him.
           Artoo waddles closer to Luke, chirping wildly, then scoots
        over the edge of the swamp. Catching on, Luke rushes to the
        water's edge. The X-wing fighter has sunk, and only the tip of
        its nose shows above the lake's surface.

LUKE: Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.

           Yoda stamps his foot in irritation.

YODA: So certain are you. Always with you it cannot be done. Hear you
nothing that I say?

           Luke looks uncertainly out at the ship.

LUKE: Master, moving stones around is one thing. This is totally
different.

YODA: No! No different! Only different in your mind. You must unlearn
what you have learned.

LUKE: (focusing, quietly) All right, I'll give it a try.

YODA: No! Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try.

           Luke closes his eyes and concentrates on thinking the ship
        out.
           Slowly, the X-wing's nose begins to rise above the water.
        It hovers for a moment and then slides back, disappearing once
        again.

LUKE: (panting heavily) I can't. It's too big.

YODA: Size matters not. Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you? Hm?
Mmmm.

           Luke shakes his head.

YODA: And well you should not. For my ally in the Force. And a
powerful ally it is. Life creates it, makes it grow. It's energy
surrounds us and binds us. Luminous beings are we...(Yoda pinches
Luke's shoulder)...not this crude matter. (a sweeping gesture) You must
feel the Force around you. (gesturing) Here, between you...me...the
tree...the rock...everywhere! Yes, even between this land and that
ship!

LUKE: (discouraged) You want the impossible.

           Quietly Yoda turns toward the X-wing fighter. With his eyes
        closed and his head bowed, he raises his arm and points at the
        ship.
           Soon, the fighter rises above the water and moves forward
        as Artoo beeps in terror and scoots away.
           The entire X-wing moves majestically, surely, toward the
        shore. Yoda stands on a tree root and guides the fighter
        carefully down toward the beach.
           Luke stares in astonishment as the fighter settles down
        onto the shore. He walks toward Yoda.

LUKE: I don't...I don't believe it.

YODA: That is why you fail.

           Luke shakes his head, bewildered.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- IMPERIAL FLEET

           The fleet around Vader's Star Destroyer now includes
        Needa's Star Destroyer, the Avenger.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

VADER: Apology accepted, Captain Needa.

           Clutching desperately at his throat, Captain Needa slumps
        down, then falls over on his back, at the feet of Darth Vader.
        Two stormtroopers pick up the lifeless body and carry it
        quickly away as Admiral Piett and two of his captains hurry up
        to the Dark Lord.

PIETT: Lord Vader, our ships have completed their scan of the area and
found nothing. If the Millennium Falcon went into light-speed, it'll
be on the other side of the galaxy by now.

VADER: Alert all commands. Calculate every possible destination along
their last know trajectory.

PIETT: Yes, my lord. We'll find them.

VADER: Don't fail me again, Admiral.

           Vader exits as the admiral turns to an aide, a little more
        uneasy than when he arrived.

PIETT: Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- IMPERIAL FLEET

           Vader's ship moves away, flanked by its fleet of smaller
        ships. the Avenger glides off into space in the opposite
        direction. No one on that ship or on Vader's is aware that,
        clinging to the side of the Avenger, is the pirateship, the
        Millennium Falcon.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

THREEPIO: Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far. (Chewie
growls) No, I will not be quiet, Chewbacca. Why doesn't anyone listen
to me?

HAN: (to Chewie) The fleet is beginning to break up. Go back and stand
by the manual release for the landing claw.

           Chewie barks, struggles from his seat, and climbs out of
        the cabin.

THREEPIO: I really don't see how thats going to help. Surrender is a
perfectly acceptable alternative in extreme circumstances. The Empire
may be gracious enough...

           Leia reaches over and shuts off Threepio, mid-sentence.

HAN: Thank you.

LEIA: What did you have in mind for your next move?

HAN: Well, if they follow standard Imperial procedure, they'll dump
their garbage before they go to light-speed, then we just float away.

LEIA: With the rest of the garbage. Then what?

HAN: Then we've got to find a safe port somewhere around here. Got any
ideas?

LEIA: No. Where are we?

HAN: The Anoat system.

LEIA: Anoat system. There's not much there.

HAN: No. Well, wait. This is interesting. Lando.

           He points to a computer mapscreen on the control panel.
        Leia slips out of her chair and moves next to the handsome
        pilot. Small light points representing several systems flash
        by on the computer screen.

LEIA: Lando system?

HAN: Lando's not a system, he's a man. Lando Calrissian. He's a card
player, gambler, scoundrel. You'd like him.

LEIA: Thanks.

HAN: Bespin. It's pretty far, but I think we can make it.

LEIA: (reading from the computer) A mining colony?

HAN: Yeah, a Tibanna gas mine. Lando conned somebody out of it. We go
back a long way, Lando and me.

LEIA: Can you trust him?

HAN: No. But he has no love for the Empire, I can tell you that.

           Chewie barks over the intercom. Han quickly changes his
        readouts and stretches to look out the cockpit window.

HAN: (into intercom) Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach!

           Han leans back in his chair and gives Leia an invisible
        smile. She thinks for a moment, shakes her head; a grin creeps
        across her face and she gives him a quick kiss.

LEIA: You do have your moments. Not many, but you have them.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- IMPERIAL STAR DESTROYER

           As the Avenger Star Destroyer moves slowly into space, the
        hatch on its underbelly opens, sending a trail of junk behind
        it. Hidden among the refuse, the Falcon tumbles away. In the
        next moment, the Avenger roars off into hyperspace. The
        Falcon's engines are ignited, and it races off into the
        distance. Amidst the slowly drifting junk, Boba Fett's ship
        appears and moves after the Falcon.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- BOG -- CLEARING -- DAY

           In the clearing behind Yoda's house, Luke again stands
        upside-down, but his face shows less strain and more
        concentration than before. Yoda sits on the ground below the
        young warrior. On the other side of the clearing, two
        equipment cases slowly rise into the air. Nearby Artoo
        watches, humming to himself, when suddenly he, too, rises into
        the air. His little legs kick desperately and his head turns
        frantically, looking for help.

YODA: Concentrate...feel the Force flow. Yes. Good. Calm, yes. Through
the Force, things you will see. Other places. The future...the past.
Old friends long gone.

           Luke suddenly becomes distressed.

LUKE: Han! Leia!

           The two packing boxes and Artoo fall to the ground with a
        crash, then Luke himself tumbles over.

YODA: (shaking his head) Hmm. Control, control. You must learn control.

LUKE: I saw...I saw a city in the clouds.

YODA: Mmm. Friends you have there.

LUKE: They were in pain.

YODA: It is the future you see.

LUKE: Future? Will they die?

           Yoda closes his eyes and lowers his head.

YODA: Difficult to see. Always in motion is the future.

LUKE: I've got to go to them.

YODA: Decide you must how to serve them best. If you leave now, help
them you could. But you would destroy all for which they have fought
and suffered.

           Luke is stopped cold by Yoda's words. Gloom shrouds him as
        he nods his head sadly.

EXTERIOR: BESPIN SYSTEM -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- DAWN

           The powerful pirate starship blasts through space as it
        heads toward the soft pink planet of Bespin.

EXTERIOR: BESPIN SURFACE -- MILLENNIUM FALCON

           It is down on the gaseous planet. Huge billowing clouds
        form a canyon as the ship banks around them, heading toward
        the system's Cloud City.
           Suddenly, two twin-pod cloud cars appear and move toward
        the Falcon. The cloud cars draw up alongside the starship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           One of the cloud cars opens fire on the Falcon, its flak
        rocking the ship. Chewie barks his concern.

HAN: (into transmitter) No, I don't have a landing permit. I'm trying
to reach Lando Calrissian.

           More flak bursts outside the cockpit window and rattles the
        ship's interior. Leia looks worried.

HAN: (into transmitter) Whoa! Wait a minute! Let me explain.

INTERCOM VOICE: You will not deviate from your present course.

THREEPIO: Rather touchy, aren't they?

LEIA: I thought you knew this person.

           Chewie barks and growls at his boss.

HAN: (to Chewie) Well, that was a long time ago. I'm sure he's
forgotten about that.

INTERCOM VOICE: Permission granted to land on Platform
Three-two-seven.

HAN: (into transmitter) Thank you.

           Angry, Han snaps off the intercom. Chewie looks at him and
        grunts. Han turns to the worried princess and her droid.

HAN: There's nothing to worry about. We go way back, Lando and me.

           Leia doesn't look convinced.

LEIA: Who's worried?

EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- CLOUD CARS

           The clouds part to reveal a full view of the city as it
        bobs in and out of the cloud surface. The cloud cars and the
        Falcon head for the gleaming white metropolis.

EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LANDING PLATFORM -- MILLENNIUM FALCON

           With the cloud cars still guarding it, the Falcon lands on
        one of the Cloud City's platforms.

EXTERIOR: LANDING PLATFORM -- DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

           Han and Leia stand at the open door, armed. Behind them,
        Chewie, also armed, surveys the scene warily.

THREEPIO: Oh. No one to meet us.

LEIA: I don't like this.

HAN: Well, what would you like?

THREEPIO: Well, they did let us land.

HAN: Look, don't worry. Everything's going to be fine. Trust me.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR -- DAY

           Lando Calrissian, a suave, dashing black man in his
        thirties, leads a group of aides and some Cloud City guard
        rapidly toward the landing platform. The group, like the other
        citizens of the city, is a motley collection of aliens,
        droids, and humans of all descriptions. Lando has a grim
        expression on his face as he moves onto the landing platform.

EXTERIOR: LANDING PLATFORM -- DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON

HAN: See? My friend. (to Chewie) Keep your eyes open, okay?

           Chewie growls as Han walks down the ramp. Lando and his men
        head across the bridge to meet the space pirate.

EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LANDING PLATFORM

           Lando stops ten feet from Han. The two men eye each other
        carefully. Lando shakes his head.

LANDO: Why, you slimy, double-crossing, no-good swindler! You've got a
lot of guts coming here, after what you pulled.

           Han points to himself innocently, mouthing, "Me?"
           Lando moves threateningly toward Han. Suddenly, he throws
        his arms around his startled, long-lost friend and embraces
        him.

LANDO: (laughs) How you doing, you old pirate? So good to see you! I
never thought I'd catch up with you again. Where you been?

           The two old friends embrace, laughing and chuckling.

EXTERIOR: LANDING PLATFORM -- DOOR OF MILLENNIUM FALCON.

THREEPIO: Well, he seems very friendly.

LEIA: (wary) Yes...very friendly.

EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LANDING PLATFORM

LANDO: What are you doing here?

HAN: (gestures toward the Falcon) Ahh...repairs. I thought you could
help me out.

LANDO: (in mock panic) What have you done to my ship?

HAN: Your ship? Hey, remember, you lost her to me fair and square.

           Chewie growls a reserved greeting. Lando suddenly notices
        the princess and smiles.

LANDO: Hello. What have we here? Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian. I'm
the administrator of this facility. and who might you be?

LEIA: Leia.

LANDO: Welcome, Leia.

           Lando bows before Leia and kisses her hand.

HAN: All right, all right, you old smoothie.

           Han takes Leia by the hand and steers her away from Lando.

THREEPIO: Hello, sir. I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations. My
facilities are at your...

           Before Threepio can finish his self-introduction, Lando has
        turned to follow Han and Leia, who are walking toward the
        city.

THREEPIO: Well, really!

           Lando, his aide, Lobot, and Han lead the way across the
        bridge, followed by Threepio, Chewie and Leia.

LANDO: What's wrong with the Falcon?

HAN: Hyperdrive.

LANDO: I'll get my people to work on it.

HAN: Good.

           Lando turns to Leia.

LANDO: You know, that ship saved my life quite a few times. She's the
fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR

           The group has crossed the narrow bridge and entered the
        city. They walk down the lovely Art Deco passageway, rounding
        several corners and passing many small plazas as they go.
        Threepio lags a bit behind.

HAN: How's the gas mine? Is it paying off for you?

LANDO: Oh, not as well as I'd like. We're a small outpost and not very
self-sufficient. And I've had supply problems of every kind. I've had
labor difficulties...(catches Han grinning at him) What's so funny?

HAN: You. Listen to you -- you sound like a businessman, a responsible
leader. Who'd have thought that, huh?

           Lando is reflective. He looks at Han a moment.

LANDO: You know, seeing you sure brings back a few things.

HAN: Yeah.

LANDO: (shakes his head) Yeah, I'm responsible these days. It's the
price you pay for being successful.

           Han and Lando laugh together, and the group moves on
        through the corridor.
           The lagging Threepio passes a Threepio-type silver droid
        who is coming out of a door.

THREEPIO: Oh! Nice to see a familiar face.

SECOND THREEPIO: (mumbles) E chu ta!

THREEPIO: How rude!

           Threepio stops, watching the silver droid move away. Then
        he hears the muffled beeping and whistling of an R2 unit
        coming from within the room.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- ANTEROOM

           Curious, Threepio enters the room.

THREEPIO: That sounds like an R2 unit in there. I wonder if...

           Threepio walks through the doorway to the main room. He
        looks in.

THREEPIO: Hello? How interesting. Oh, my.

MAN'S VOICE: (from within) Who are you?

THREEPIO: Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I...I didn't mean to intrude. No,
no, please don't get up. No!

           A laser bolt to Threepio's chest sends him flying in twenty
        directions. Smoldering mechanical arms and legs bounce off the
        walls as the door whooshes closed behind him.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR

           Lando, Han, and Leia continue down the corridor unaware of
        Threepio's dreadful accident. Chewbacca glances around, sniffs
        the air, but shrugs his shoulders and follows the group.

EXTERIOR: DAGOBAH -- BOG -- DUSK

           In the bright lights of the fighter, Luke loads a heavy
        case into the belly of the ship. Artoo sits on top of the
        X-wing, settling down into his cubbyhole. Yoda stands nearby
        on a log.

YODA: Luke! You must complete the training.

LUKE: I can't keep the vision out of my head. They're my friends. I've
got to help them.

YODA: You must not go!

LUKE: But Han and Leia will die if I don't.

BEN'S VOICE: You don't know that.

           Luke looks toward the voice in amazement. Ben has
        materialized as a real, slightly shimmering image near Yoda.
        The power of his presence stops Luke.

BEN: Even Yoda cannot see their fate.

LUKE: But I can help them! I feel the Force!

BEN: But you cannot control it. This is a dangerous time for you, when
you will be tempted by the dark side of the Force.

YODA: Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen. The cave. Remember your failure
at the cave!

LUKE: But I've learned so much since then. Master Yoda, I promise to
return and finish what I've begun. You have my word.

BEN: It is you and your abilities the Emperor wants. that is why your
friends are made to suffer.

LUKE: And that is why I have to go.

BEN: Luke, I don't want to lose you to the Emperor the way I lost
Vader.

LUKE: You won't.

YODA: Stopped they must be. On this depends. Only a fully trained Jedi
Knight with the Force as his ally will conquer Vader and his Emperor.
If you end your training now, if you choose the quick and easy path,
as Vader did, you will become an agent of evil.

BEN: Patience.

LUKE: And sacrifice Han and Leia?

YODA: If you honor what they fight for...yes!

           Luke is in great anguish. He struggles with the dilemma, a
        battle raging in his mind.

BEN: If you choose to face Vader, you will do it alone. I cannot
interfere.

LUKE: I understand. (he moves to his X-wing) Artoo, fire up the
converters.

           Artoo whistles a happy reply.

BEN: Luke, don't give in to hate -- that leads to the dark side.

           Luke nods and climbs into his ship.

YODA: Strong is Vader. Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.

LUKE: I will. And I'll return. I promise.

           Artoo closes the cockpit. Ben and Yoda stand watching as
        the roar of the engines and the wind engulf them.

YODA: (sighs) Told you, I did. Reckless is he. Now matters are worse.

BEN: That boy is our last hope.

YODA: (looks up) No. There is another.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- PLANET DAGOBAH

           Luke's tiny X-wing rockets away from the green planet of
        Dagobah and off into space.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LIVING QUARTERS -- DAY

           Within the quarters assigned her on Cloud City, Leia paces
        in agitation. She has changed from her cold-weather pants and
        jacket to a lovely dress. Her hair is down, tied back with
        ribbons. She moves from a large, open window and turns to see
        Han entering through the doorway.

HAN: The ship is almost finished. Two or Three more things and we're
in great shape.

LEIA: The sooner the better. Something's wrong here. No one has seen
or knows anything about Threepio. He's been gone too long to have
gotten lost.

           Han takes Leia by the shoulders and gently kisses her
        forehead.

HAN: Relax. I'll talk to Lando and see what I can find out.

LEIA: I don't trust Lando.

HAN: Well, I don't trust him, either. But he is my friend. Besides,
we'll soon be gone.

LEIA: And then you're as good as gone, aren't you?

           Not speaking, Han considers her words and gazes at her
        troubled face.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- JUNK ROOM

        The room is piled high with broken and discarded machine
        parts. Four Ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the
        junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves
        briskly toward a pit of molten metal. Pieces of Threepio's
        golden body move down the belt. Chewie enters the room and
        spots an Ugnaught picking up and inspecting Threepio's head.
        The Wookiee barks a command, startling the Ugnaught, then
        reaches to grab the head. But the Ugnaught tosses it away from
        him to another Ugnaught. This game of keep-away goes on untilopen the door,
you stupid lump.

           Chewie, Leia, and Lando ret        onto the ground.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LIVING QUARTERS -- DAY

           The door zaps open. Chewbacca walks in, carrying a packing
        case of Threepio, arms and legs hanging over the edge.

LEIA: What happened?

           Chewie sets the case on a table, grunting and groaning an
        explanation.

HAN: Where? Found him in a junk pile?

LEIA: Oh, what a mess. Chewie, do you think you can repair him?

           The giant Wookiee studies the array of robot parts. He
        looks at the princess and shrugs sadly.

HAN: Lando's got people who can fix him.

LEIA: No, thanks.

           There is a buzz and the door slides open, revealing Lando.

LANDO: I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?

LEIA: Not really.

LANDO: You look absolutely beautiful. You truly belong here with us
among the clouds.

LEIA: (coolly) Thank you.

LANDO: Will you join me for a little refreshment?

           Han looks at Lando suspiciously, but Chewie barks at the
        mention of food and licks his lips.

LANDO: Everyone's invited, of course.

           Leia takes Lando's proffered arm, and the group turns to
        go. Lando spots Threepio's remains.

LANDO: Having trouble with you droid?

           Han and Leia exchange a quick glance.

HAN: No. No problem. Why?

           Han and Leia move arm-in-arm through the door, followed by
        Lando and Chewie. The door slides closed behind them.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR -- DAY

           Leia walks between Han and Lando as Chewie follows a short
        distance behind. Long shafts of light pour across the corridor
        between tall, pure-white columns.

LANDO: So you see, since we're a small operation, we don't fall into
the...uh...jurisdiction of the Empire.

LEIA: So you're part of the mining guild then?

LANDO: No, not actually. Our operation is small enough not to be
noticed...which is advantageous for everybody since our customers are
anxious to avoid attracting attention to themselves.

           The group walks into another corridor and heads for a huge
        doorway at the far end.

HAN: Aren't you afraid the Empire's going to find out about this
little operation and shut you down?

LANDO: That's always been a danger looming like a shadow over
everything we've built here. But things have developed that will
insure security. I've just made a deal that will keep the Empire out
of here forever.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- DINING ROOM

           The mighty doors to the dining room slide open and the
        group enters the dining room. At the far end of a huge banquet
        table sits Darth Vader. Standing at his side and slightly
        behind him is Boba Fett, the bounty hunter.
           Faster than the wink of an eye, Han draws his blaster and
        pops off a couple of shots directly at Vader. The Dark Lord
        quickly raises his hand, deflecting the bolts into one of the
        side walls, where they explode harmlessly. Just as quickly,
        Han's weapon zips into Vader's hand. The evil presence calmly
        places the gun on the table in front of him.

VADER: We would be honored if you would join us.

           Han gives Lando a mean look.

LANDO: I had no choice. They arrived right before you did. I'm sorry.

HAN: I'm sorry, too.

EXTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- BESPIN SYSTEM

           Luke's X-wing races through thick clouds toward Cloud City.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT

           Luke is grim-faced as he pilots his course toward Bespin's
        shining city. Artoo's beeps and whistles are transmitted onto
        the scope.

LUKE: (into comlink) No, Threepio's with them.

           Artoo whistles another worried inquiry.

LUKE: (into comlink) Just hang on. We're almost there.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LARGE CELL

           Chewbacca is in a Cloud City prison cell. The stark room is
        flooded with hot light. To add to Chewie's misery, a
        high-pitched whistle screeches loudly. Chewie is going mad. He
        hits the wall with giant fists as he paces back and forth
        across the cell floor. The upper lights go off abruptly. The
        prisoner rubs his eyes and moves to a wall, where he listens
        for a moment. Then, moaning to himself, he moves to a platform
        where the disassembled pieces of Threepio lie. He picks up the
        golden droid's head and meditates on it for a moment, barking
        a few philosophical remarks. Chewie sticks the robot's head on
        its torso and starts adjusting wires and circuits. Suddenly,
        the lights in Threepio's eyes spark to life as Chewie touches
        two connectors together. Threepio immediately begins to speak,
        but his voice is so slow and so low as to be nearly
        unintelligible.

THREEPIO: Mmmm. Oh, my. Uh, I, uh -- Take this off! I, uh, don't mean
to intrude here. I, don't, no, no, no...Please don't get up. No!

           Chewie looks at Threepio in bewilderment, then scratches
        his furry head. He gets an idea and adjusts some connections,
        whereupon Threepio immediately begins speaking normally.

THREEPIO: Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger. I must tell the
others. Oh, no! I've been shot!

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- PRISON ENTRY AREA

           Darth Vader strides through the room as two stormtroopers
        prepare an elaborate torture mechanism. Han is strapped to a
        rack which tilts forward onto the torture device. Vader
        activates the mechanism, creating two bursts of sparks, one of
        which strikes Han's face.
           The door opens, and Darth Vader moves to the holding
        chamber, where Lando and Boba Fett await him.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- HOLDING CHAMBER

LANDO: Lord Vader.

VADER: (to Fett) You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hut after I
have Skywalker.

           Han's screams filter through the torture room door.

BOBA FETT: He's no good to me dead.

VADER: He will not be permanently damaged.

LANDO: Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?

VADER: They must never again leave this city.

LANDO: That was never a condition of our agreement, nor was giving Han
to this bounty hunter!

VADER: Perhaps you think you're being treated unfairly.

LANDO: No.

VADER: Good. It would be unfortunate if I had to leave a garrison
here.

           Vader turns and sweeps into the elevator with Boba Fett.
        Lando walks swiftly down another corridor, muttering to
        himself.

LANDO: This deal's getting worse all the time.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LARGE CELL

           Chewie now has a little more of Threepio back together. One
        arm is connected, but the legs are yet to be attached. There
        is one small problem, however. It seems the Wookiee has
        managed to put the droid's head on backwards.

THREEPIO: Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that. Oh! Something's not
right because now I can't see. Wait. Wait! Oh, my! what have you done?
I'm backwards, you stupid furball. Only an overgrown mophead like you
would be stupid enough...

           Threepio is cut off in mid-sentence as Chewie angrily
        deactivates a circuit and the droid shuts down. The Wookiee
        smells something and sits up. The door to the chamber slides
        open and a ragged Han Solo is shoved into the room by two
        stormtroopers. Barking his concern, the huge Wookiee gives Han
        a big hug. Han is very pale, with dark circles under his eyes.

HAN: I feel terrible.

           Chewie helps Han to a platform and then turns as the door
        slides open revealing Leia. She, too, looks a little worse for
        wear. The troopers push her into the cell, and the door slides
        closed. She moves to Han, who is lying on the platform, and
        kneels next to him, gently stroking his head.

LEIA: Why are they doing this?

HAN: They never even asked me any questions.

           The cell door slides open. Lando and two of his guards
        enter.

LEIA: Lando.

HAN: Get out of here, Lando!

LANDO: Shut up and listen! Vader has agreed to turn Leia and Chewie
over to me.

HAN: Over to you?

LANDO: They'll have to stay here, but at least they'll be safe.

LEIA: What about Han?

LANDO Vader's giving him to the bounty hunter.

LEIA: Vader wants us all dead.

LANDO: He doesn't want you at all. He's after somebody called
Skywalker.

HAN: Luke?

LANDO: Lord Vader has set a trap for him.

           Leia's mind is racing.

LEIA: And we're the bait.

LANDO: Well, he's on his way.

           Han's rage peaks.

HAN: Perfect. You fixed us all pretty good, didn't you? (spits it out)
My friend!

           Han hauls off and punches Lando. The two friends are
        instantly engaged in a frantic close-quarters fight. The
        guards hit Han with their rifle butts and he flies across the
        room. Chewie growls and starts for the guards. They point
        their laser weapons at the giant Wookiee, but Lando stops
        them.

LANDO: Stop! I've done all I can do. I'm sorry I couldn't do better,
but I have my own problems.

HAN: Yeah, you're a real hero.

           Lando and the guards leave. Han wipes the blood from his
        chin as Leia and Chewie help him up.

LEIA: (dabs at his wound) You certainly have a way with people.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

           Four armor-suited stormtroopers stand at the ready in the
        large chamber, which is filled with pipes and chemical tanks.
        In the middle of the room is a round pit housing a hydraulic
        platform. Darth Vader and Lando stand near the platform.

VADER: This facility is crude, but it should be adequate to freeze
Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.

           An Imperial soldier appears.

IMPERIAL SOLDIER: Lord Vader, ship approaching. X-wing class.

VADER: Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.

           The soldier bows and leaves the chamber.

LANDO: Lord Vader, we only use this facility for carbon freezing. If
you put him in there, it might kill him.

VADER: I do not want the Emperor's prize damaged. We will test it...on
Captain Solo.

           Lando's face registers dismay.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- BESPIN SYSTEM -- LUKE'S X-WING

           Luke's X-wing moves through the clouds as it nears the
        city.

INTERIOR: LUKE'S X-WING -- COCKPIT

           Encountering no city guards, Luke scans the display panel
        with concern.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

           There is a great activity on the carbon-freezing platform.
        Six Ugnaughts frantically prepare the chamber for use. A
        special coffinlike container is put in place. With Boba Fett
        in the lead, a squad of six stormtroopers brings in Han, Leia
        and Chewie. Strapped to Chewie's back, with only his head,
        torso, and one arm assembled, is Threepio. Threepio's head
        faces the opposite direction from Chewie's and the droid is
        constantly twisting around in a vain effort to see what is
        happening. His one attached arm is animate and expressive,
        intermittently pointing, gesturing, and covering his eyes. The
        remaining pieces of his body are randomly bundled to the
        Wookiee's back so that his legs and other arm stick out at odd
        angles from the pack.

THREEPIO: If only you had attached my legs, I wouldn't be in this
ridiculous position. Now, remember, Chewbacca, you have a
responsibility to me, so don't do anything foolish.

HAN: (to Lando) What's going on...buddy?

LANDO: You're being put into carbon freeze.

           Boba Fett moves away from the group to Darth Vader.

BOBA FETT: What if he doesn't survive? He's worth a lot to me.

VADER: The Empire will compensate you if he dies. Put him in!

           Realizing what is about to happen, Chewie lets out a wild
        howl and attacks the stormtroopers surrounding Han. Within
        seconds, other Imperial reinforcements join the scuffle,
        clubbing the giant Wookiee with their laser weapons. From the
        instant of Chewie's first move, Threepio begins to scream in
        panic while he tries to protect himself with his one arm.

THREEPIO: Oh, no! No, no, no! Stop, Chewbacca, stop...!

           The stormtroopers are about to bash Chewie in the face.

HAN: Stop, Chewie, stop! Do you hear me? Stop!

THREEPIO: Yes, stop, please! I'm not ready to die.

           Han breaks away from his captors. Vader nods to the guards
        to let him go and the pirate breaks up the fight.

HAN: Chewie! Chewie, this won't help me. Hey!

           Han gives the Wookiee a stern look.

HAN: Save your strength. There'll be another time. The princess -- you
have to take care of her. You hear me?

           Han winks at the Wookiee, who wails a doleful farewell.
           In a flash the guards have slipped binders on Chewbacca,
        who is too distraught to protest. Han turns to Princess Leia.
        They look sorrowfully at one another, then Han moves toward
        her and gives her a final, passionate kiss.

LEIA: I love you!

HAN: I know.

           Tears roll down Leia's face as she watches the dashing
        pirate walk to the hydraulic platform. Han looks one final
        time at his friends -- and then, suddenly, the platform drops.
        Chewie howls. Leia turns away in agony. Lando winces in
        sorrow; it makes a life-changing impression on him.
           Instantly, fiery liquid begins to pour down in a shower of
        sparks and fluid as great as any steel furnace. Holding Leia,
        Chewie half-turns away from the sight, giving Threepio a view
        of the procedure.

THREEPIO: What...what's going on? Turn around, Chewbacca, I can't see.
Oh...they've encased him in carbonite. He should be quite
well-protected -- if he survives the freezing process, that is.

           Chewie is in no mood for technical discussion; he gives the
        droid an angry glance and barks.
           A huge mechanical tong lifts the steaming metal-encased
        space pirate out of the vat and stands him on the platform.
        Some Ugnaughts rush over and push the block over onto the
        platform. They slide the coffinlike structure to the block and
        lift the metal block, placing it inside. They then attach an
        electronic box onto the structure and step away.
           Lando kneels and adjusts some knobs, measuring the heat. He
        shakes his head in relief.

VADER: Well, Calrissian, did he survive?

LANDO: Yes, he's alive. And in perfect hibernation.

           Vader turns to Boba Fett.

VADER: He's all yours bounty hunter. Reset the chamber for Skywalker.

IMPERIAL OFFICER: Skywalker has just landed, my lord.

VADER: Good. See to it that he finds his way here. Calrissian, take
the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.

LANDO: You said they'd be left in the city under my supervision.

VADER: I am altering the deal. Pray I don't alter it any further.

           Lando's hand instinctively goes to his throat as he turns
        to Leia, Chewie, and Threepio.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR -- DAY

           As Luke and Artoo move carefully down a deserted corridor,
        they hear a group of people coming down a side hallway. Artoo
        lets out an excited series of beeps and whistles. Luke glares
        at the tiny droid, who stops in his tracks with a feeble
        squeak.
           Boba Fett enters from a side hallway followed by two guards
        pushing the floating, encased body of Han Solo. Two
        stormtroopers, who follow, immediately spot Luke and open fire
        on him. The youth draws his weapon and blasts the two
        troopers before they can get off a second shot. The two guards
        whisk Han into another hallway as Fett lowers his arm and
        fires a deadly laser at Luke, which explodes to one side and
        tears up a huge chunk of wall.
           Luke rushes to a side hallway, but by the time he reaches
        it, Fett, Han, and the guards are gone. A think metal door
        blocks the passage. Luke turns to see Leia, Chewie, Threepio,
        and Lando being herded down a second hallway by several other
        stormtroopers. Leia turns just in time to see Luke.

LEIA: Luke! Luke, don't -- it's a trap! It's a trap!

           Before she can finish, she is pulled through a doorway and
        disappears from sight. Luke races after the group, leaving
        little Artoo trailing behind.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- ANTEROOM

           Luke runs into an anteroom and stops to get his bearings.
        Leia and the others are nowhere to be seen. Behind Luke, Artoo
        scoots down the corridor toward the anteroom when suddenly a
        giant metal door comes slamming down, cutting off Luke's exit.
        Several more doors clang shut, echoing through the chamber.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- HALLWAY LEADING TO ANTEROOM

           Artoo stands with his nose pressed against the giant metal
        door. He whistles a long sigh of relief and, a little dazed,
        wanders off in the other direction.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER -- ANTEROOM

           Luke cautiously walks forward among hissing pipes and
        steam. Seeing an opening above him, he stops to look up. As he
        does, the platform he stands on begins to move.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

           Luke rises into the chamber, borne by the platform. The
        room is deathly quiet. Very little steam escapes the pipes and
        no one else seems to be in the large room. Warily, Luke walks
        toward the stairway.
           Steam begins to build up in the chamber. Looking up through
        the steam, Luke sees a dark figure standing on a walkway above
        him. Luke holsters his gun and moves up the stairs to face
        Vader. He feels confident, eager to engage his enemy.

VADER: The Force is with you, young Skywalker. But you are not a Jedi
yet.

           Luke ignites his sword in answer. In an instant, Vader's
        own sword is lit. Luke lunges, but Vader repels the blow.
        Again Luke attacks, and the swords of the two combatants clash
        in battle.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR

           Leia, Lando, and Chewie, with Threepio on his back, march
        along, guarded by six stormtroopers. The group reaches an
        intersection where Lobot and a dozen of Lando's guards stand
        at attention.
           The guards immediately aim their weapons at the startled
        stormtroopers. Taking the stormtroopers' weapons from them,
        Lobot hands one to Leia and one to Lando.

LANDO: Well done. Hold them in the security tower -- and keep it
quiet. Move.

           As Lando's guards quickly march the stormtroopers away,
        Lando begins to undo Chewie's binding.

LEIA: What do you think you're doing?

LANDO: We're getting out of here.

THREEPIO: I knew all along it had to be a mistake.

           Chewie turns on Lando and starts to choke him.

LEIA: Do you think that after what you did to Han we're going to trust
you?

           Lando tries to free himself from Chewie.

LANDO: (choking) I had no choice...

           Chewie barks ferociously.

THREEPIO: (to Chewie) What are you doing? Trust him, trust him!

LEIA: Oh, so we understand, don't we, Chewie? He had no choice.

LANDO: I'm just trying to help...

LEIA: We don't need any of your help.

LANDO: (choking) H-a-a-a...

LEIA: What?

THREEPIO: It sounds like Han.

LANDO: There's still a chance to save Han...I mean, at the East
Platform...

LEIA: Chewie.

           Chewie finally releases Lando, who fights to get his breath
        back.

THREEPIO: (to Lando) I'm terribly sorry about all this. After all,
he's only a Wookiee.

EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- EAST LANDING PLATFORM -- BOBA FETT'S SHIP

           The two guards slide Han's encased body into an opening in
        the side of the bounty hunter's ship. Boba Fett climb aboard
        on a ladder next to the cargo hold.

BOBA FETT: Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.

           And with that, the door slams shut.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR

           Lando, Leia, and Chewie run down a Cloud City corridor when
        suddenly they spot Artoo who rushes toward them, beeping
        wildly.

THREEPIO: Artoo! Artoo! Where have you been?

           Chewie turns around to see the stubby droid, causing
        Threepio to be spun out of sight of his friend.

THREEPIO: Turn around, you wooly...! (to Artoo) Hurry, hurry! We're
trying to save Han from the bounty hunter!

           Whistling frantically to Threepio, Artoo scoots along with
        the racing group.

THREEPIO: Well, at least your still in one piece! Look what happened
to me!

EXTERIOR: EAST LANDING PLATFORM -- SIDE BAY

           An elevator door slides open and Lando, Leia, and Chewbacca
        race for a large bay overlooking the East Landing Platform.
           Just as they arrive, Boba Fett's ship takes off against a
        cloudy sunset sky. 
           In wild anguish, Chewie howls and starts firing at the
        ship.

THREEPIO: Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!

           A laser bolt explodes near the princess. Everyone turns to
        see what Threepio has already spotted coming from the other
        direction; a squad of stormtroopers running toward them. Artoo
        peeks out from the elevator.
           Leia and Chewbacca start firing at the troopers as Lando
        makes a break for the elevator. Laser bolts continue to
        explode around the princess and the Wookiee, but they refuse
        to budge. Lando sticks his head out of the elevator and
        motions for the pair to run, but they barely notice. They seem
        possessed, transported, as all the frustration of captivity
        and anger of loss pour through their death-dealing weapons.
           But after a few moments, they begin to move through the
        rain of laser fire toward the elevator. Once they are inside,
        the door slams shut and the stormtroopers race forward.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CARBON-FREEZING CHAMBER

           Luke and Vader are locked in combat on the platform
        overlooking the chamber. Their swords clash, the platform
        sways. Luke aggressively drives Vader back, forcing Vader to
        use defensive tactics.

VADER: You have learned much, young one.

LUKE: You'll find I'm full of surprises.

           Vader makes two quick moves, hooking Luke's sword out of
        his hand and sending it flying. Another lightning move at
        Luke's feet forces the youth to jump back to protect himself.
        Losing his balance, Luke rolls down the stairs to the circular
        carbon-freezing platform. There he sprawls on the floor,
        surprised and shaken. Just in time he looks up to see Vader,
        like a giant black bird, flying right at him. Luke rolls away
        as Vader lands. Crouching, Luke keeps his gaze steadily on his
        enemy.

VADER: Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker. Obi-Wan knew this to be
true.

LUKE: No!

           Behind Luke the hydraulic elevator cover has opened
        noiselessly. All the while, Luke slowly, cautiously moves
        back, away from the Dark Lord.
           Suddenly, Vader attacks so forcefully that Luke loses his
        balance and falls back into the opening. There is a rumble,
        and in an instant freezing steam rises to obscure Vader's
        vision.  Vader turns aside and deactivates his sword.

VADER: All to easy. Perhaps you are not as strong as the Emperor
thought.

           Through the steam behind Vader something blurs upward.
        Liquid metal begins to pour into the pit.
           Vader turns around -- and then looks up. He sees Luke, who
        has leaped fifteen feet straight up and who now hangs from
        some hoses on the carbonite outlet.

VADER: Impressive...most impressive.

           Luke jumps down to the platform where he is separated from
        Vader by the steaming carbonite pit. He raises his hand. His
        sword, which had fallen on another part of the platform,
        swiftly jumps into his outstretched hand and is instantly
        ignited. Vader immediately lights his sword as well.

VADER: Obi-Wan has taught you well. You have controlled your fear...
now release your anger.

           Luke is more cautious, controlling his anger. He begins to
        retreat as Vader goads him on. As Luke takes a defensive
        position, he realizes he has been foolhardy. A quick sword
        exchange and Luke forces Vader back. Another exchange and
        Vader retreats. Luke presses forward.

VADER: Only your hatred can destroy me.

           Breathing hard, Luke jumps in the air, turning a somersault
        over Vader. He lands on the floor and slashes at Vader as the
        room continues to fill up with steam.
           Vader retreats before Luke's skillful sword. Vader blocks
        the sword, but looses his balance and falls into the outer rim
        of pipes. The energy Luke has used to stop Vader has brought
        him to the point of collapse. Luke moves to the edge and looks
        down, but sees no sign of Vader. He then deactivates his
        sword, hooks it on his belt, and lowers himself into the pit.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- TUNNEL AND REACTOR CONTROL ROOM

           Moving through a tunnellike entrance, Luke cautiously
        approaches the reactor room. He ignites his sword and moves
        into the room and toward a large window as Vader enters.
           Luke raises his sword and moves forward to attack.
           Behind Luke a large piece of machinery detaches itself from
        the wall and comes smashing forward toward his back. Luke
        turns and cuts it in half just as another machine comes
        hurtling at him. Using the Force, Luke manages to deflect it
        and send it flying as if it had hit an invisible shield. A
        large pipe detaches and comes flying at Luke. He deflects it.
        Sparking wires pull out of the wall and begin to whip at the
        youth. Small tools and equipment come flying at him.
        Bombardment from all sides, Luke does his best to deflect
        everything, but soon he is bloodied and bruised. Finally, one
        machine glances off his and goes flying out the large window.
        A fierce wind blows into the room, unmoving, stands the dark,
        rocklike figure of Vader.
           A piece of machinery hits Luke and he is knocked out of the
        window.

INTERIOR: GANTRY -- OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM -- REACTOR SHAFT

           Luke falls onto the gantry, rolls, and hangs over the edge,
        holding his deactivated sword in hand. He puts the sword on
        his belt and begins to scramble up.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR LEADING TO LANDING PLATFORM

           Leia, Lando, Chewie and the droids come round a corner and
        head for the door to the landing platform. They glimpse the
        Millennium Falcon for a moment before the door slams shut. The
        group ducks into an alcove as stormtroopers arrive at the end
        of the corridor. The troopers send a rain of laser bolts at
        the group. Chewie returns their fire as Lando punches
        desperately at the door's control panel.

LANDO: The security codes has been changed!

THREEPIO: Artoo, you can tell the computer to override the security
system.

           Threepio points to a computer socket on the control panel.
        Artoo beeps and scoots toward it. Lando meanwhile has
        connected up to the panel's intercom.

LANDO: Attention! This is Lando Calrissian. The Empire has takes
control of the city. I advise everyone to leave before more Imperial
troops arrive.

           Artoo takes off a computer cover and sticks his computer
        arm into the socket. Suddenly, a short beep turns into a wild
        scream. Artoo's circuits light up, his head spins wildly, and
        smoke begins to seep out underneath him. Quickly, Chewie pulls
        him away.

LANDO: This way.

           Lando, Leia, Artoo, and Chewie flee down the corridor. As
        he scoots along with them, Artoo sends some angry beeps
        Threepio's way.

THREEPIO: Don't blame me. I'm an interpreter. I'm not supposed to know
a power socket from a computer terminal.

INTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- CORRIDOR

           In a panic, Cloud City residents are trying to get out of
        the city. Some carry boxes, others packages. They run, then
        change direction. Some are shooting at stormtroopers, others
        simply try to hide.
           Other stormtroopers pursue Lando, Leia, and Chewie who are
        firing back at them. Artoo works on another door to the
        landing platform while Threepio berates him for his seeming
        ineptitude.

THREEPIO: What are you talking about? We're not interested in the
hyperdrive on the Millennium Falcon. It's fixed! Just open the door,
you stupid lump.

           Chewie, Leia, and Lando retreat along the corridor. A
        triumphant beep from Artoo -- and the door snaps open.

THREEPIO: (to Artoo) I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!

           Artoo lays a cloud fog, obscuring everything, as the group
        dashes outside.

EXTERIOR: LANDING PLATFORM -- CLOUD CITY -- DUSK

           They race for the Millennium Falcon as a battalion of
        stormtroopers reaches the main door. Lando and Leia hold off
        the troops as the droids get on board with Chewie. As Chewie
        bounds to the ship the Threepio on his back, Threepio hits his
        head on the top of the ramp.

THREEPIO: Ouch! Oh! Ah! That hurt, Bend down, you thoughtless...Ow!

           Chewie starts up the ship. The giant engines begin to whine
        as Lando and Leia race up the ramp under a hail of laser fire.

LANDO: Leia! Go!

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- CORRIDOR

           Artoo drags the partially assembled Threepio down the
        corridor of the Falcon.

THREEPIO: I thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. Of
course, I've looked better.

           Artoo beeps understandingly.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Chewie works the controls as Leia sits in Han's seat and
        Lando watches over their shoulders. As Chewie pulls back on
        the throttle, the ship begins to move.

EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LANDING PLATFORM -- DUSK

           The Millennium Falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight
        sky and roars away from the city. Troops fire after it and TIE
        fighters take off in pursuit.

INTERIOR: GANTRY -- OUTSIDE CONTROL ROOM -- REACTOR SHAFT

           Luke moves along the railing and up to the control room.
        Vader lunges at him and Luke immediately raises his lit sword
        to meet Vader's. Sparks fly as they duel, Vader gradually
        forcing Luke backward toward the gantry.

VADER: You are beaten. It is useless to resist. Don't let yourself be
destroyed as Obi-Wan did.

           Luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at
        Vader so viciously that he nicks Vader on the shoulder. The
        black armor sparks and smokes and Vader seems to be hurt, but
        immediately recovers.
           Luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as Vader
        comes at him, slashing at the young Jedi with his sword. Luke
        makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to
        the end of the gantry. Vader's sword comes slashing down,
        cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught
        by the rising wind and blown upward.
           Luke glances at the instrument complex floating away. At
        that instant, Vader's sword comes down across Luke's right
        forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying. 
        In great pain, Luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit 
        and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end. Vader
        follows. The wind subsides. Luke holds on. There is nowhere
        else to go. 

VADER: There is no escape. Don't make me destroy you. You do not yet
realize your importance. You have only begun to discover you power.
Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength,
we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.

LUKE: I'll never join you!

VADER: If you only knew the power of the dark side. Obi-Wan never told
you what happened to your father.

LUKE: He told me enough! He told me you killed him.

VADER: No. I am your father.

           Shocked, Luke looks at Vader in utter disbelief.

LUKE: No. No. That's not true! That's impossible!

VADER: Search your feelings. You know it to be true.

LUKE: No! No! No!

VADER: Luke. You can destroy the Emperor. He has foreseen this. It is
your destiny. Join me, and we can rule the galaxy as father and son.
Come with me. It's the only way.

           Vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to Luke.
           A calm comes over Luke, and he makes a decision. In the
        next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space. The
        Dark Lord looks over the platform and sees Luke falling far
        below. The wind begins to blow at Vader's cape and the torrent
        finally forces him back, away from the edge. The wind soon
        fades and the wounded Jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab
        onto anything to break his fall.

INTERIOR: REACTOR SHAFT

           Suddenly Luke is sucked into an exhaust pipe in the side of
        the shaft. When Vader sees this, he turns and hurries off the
        platform.

INTERIOR: EXHAUST PIPE

           Luke tumbles through the exhaust pipe.
           He slides to the end of the slickly polished pipe and stops
        as his feet hit a circular grill and knock it open. Luke claws
        at the surface of the pipe, trying to keep from sliding out
        into space.

EXTERIOR: BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY -- WEATHER VANE -- DUSK

           Unable to hang onto the pipe, Luke tumbles out, emerging at
        the undermost part of Cloud City. Reaching out desperately, he
        manages to grab onto on electronic weather vane.

LUKE: Ben...Ben, please!

           Luke tries to pull himself up on the weather vane but slips
        back down. He hooks one of his legs around the fragile
        instruments. All the while, a powerful current of air rushes
        out at him from the exhaust pipe.

LUKE: Ben. Leia!

           There is an ominous cracking sound from the base of the
        weather vane and a piece breaks off, falling into the clouds
        far below.

LUKE: Hear me! Leia!

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Leia seems to be lost in a fog, her expression troubled.
        Chewie is busy operating the ship. Lando stands next to the
        Wookiee, watching a readout on the control panel.

LEIA: Luke...We've got to go back.

           Chewie growls in surprise.

LANDO: What?

LEIA: I know where Luke is.

LANDO: But what about those fighter?

           Chewie barks in agreement with Lando.

LEIA: Chewie, just do it.

LANDO: But what about Vader?

           Chewie turns on Lando, the newcomer, with an ominous growl.

LANDO: All right, all right, all right.

EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- MILLENNIUM FALCON -- DUSK

           The Falcon makes a graceful banking turn back toward Cloud
        City.

EXTERIOR: CLOUD CITY -- LANDING PLATFORM

           Vader enters the landing platform and watches as the speck
        that is the Falcon disappears. The wind blows at his cape.
           He turns to two aides who are standing near the entrance to
        the landing platform.

VADER: Bring my shuttle.

EXTERIOR: BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY -- WEATHER VANE

           Nearly unconscious, Luke hangs upside-down on the weather
        vane as his body shifts in the wind.

EXTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

           The Falcon dives to the underside of the floating city.
        Three TIE fighter close in on the starship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON

           Leia tries to remain calm.

LANDO: (pointing out the cockpit window) Look, someone's up there.

LEIA: It's Luke. Chewie, slow down. Slow down and we'll get under him.
Lando, open the top hatch.

           Lando rushes out of the cockpit.

EXTERIOR: BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY -- WEATHER VANE

           Luke hangs by one arm from the crossbar of the weather
        vane. He slips from the bar and grabs onto the pole of the
        vane as the Falcon banks toward him. The Falcon positions
        itself under Luke as Lando moves up through the opening of the
        hatch. Luke begins to slide and finally falls from the vane
        into space.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Out the cockpit window, Leia sees Luke falling from the
        bottom of the city. The ship gains on him.

LEIA: Okay. Easy, Chewie.

           The Falcon closes in on Luke.

EXTERIOR: BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

           Three TIE fighters race toward the Falcon, firing away.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- HATCH

           The hatch pops open with a hiss of pressure. Lando reaches
        out to help the battered warrior inside the ship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Flak bursts all around it as the Falcon banks away from the
        city. Leia and Chewie struggle with the controls.

LEIA: (into intercom) Lando?

LANDO: (over intercom) Okay, let's go.

EXTERIOR: BOTTOM OF CLOUD CITY

           The Falcon races away. It is closely followed by three TIE
        fighters, all of which keep up a heavy laser assault on the
        fleeing starship.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Explosions erupt all around the cockpit, buffeting the ship
        wildly. Chewie howls as he frantically tries to control the
        ship.
           Leia and Chewie turns to see Luke, bloody and battered,
        enter the cockpit supported by Lando. Leia jumps up and hugs
        him while Chewie barks in joyous relief.

LUKE: Oh, Leia.

LANDO: All right, Chewie. Let's go.

           Leia helps Luke from the cockpit as another huge blast
        rocks the ship.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- CLOUD CITY -- DAY

           The Falcon, still followed by the three TIE fighters, races
        away from the cloud-covered city.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- SLEEPING QUARTERS

           Luke rests on a cot, his injured arm wrapped in a
        protective cuff. Leia gently wipes his face. The ship lurches
        again.

LEIA: I'll be back.

           She kisses him, then leaves the quarters.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           All over the ship muted alarm buzzers sound. Lando
        anxiously watches the flashing lights on the control panel and
        hurriedly adjusts some switches. Seated next to him, Chewie
        points out a new blip appearing on the panel. Leia, watching
        over their shoulders, recognizes the shape.

LEIA: Star Destroyer.

LANDO: All right, Chewie. Ready for light-speed.

LEIA: If your people fixed the hyperdrive.

           Another explosion rocks the ship. Leia notices as a green
        light on the panel next to her flashes on.

LEIA: All the coordinates are set. It's now or never.

           Chewie barks in agreement.

LANDO: Punch it!

           The Wookiee shrugs and pulls back on the light-speed
        throttle. The sound of the ion engine changes...it is winding
        up. Faces are tense, expectant. But nothing happens, and the
        engine goes off. Chewie lets out a frustrated howl. The flak
        still violently rocks the ship.

LANDO: They told me they fixed it. I trusted them to fix it. It's not
my fault!

           Chewie gets up from his chair and starts out of the
        cockpit. He gives Lando and angry shove as he storms past him.

EXTERIOR: SPACE

           In the distance the TIE fighters continue their chase,
        still shooting lasers. Vader's Star Destroyer moves behind
        them, determinedly following the Falcon.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

           Vader stands on the bridge looking out the window as
        Admiral Piett approaches him.

PIETT: They'll be in range of our tractor beam in moments, lord.

VADER: Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive on the Millennium
Falcon?

PIETT: Yes, my lord.

VADER: Good. Prepare the boarding party and set for your weapons for
stun.

PIETT: Yes, my lord.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON

           Beeping while he works, Artoo is busy connecting some wires
        to Threepio who now has one leg attached.
           Chewie enters through the doorway, grunting to himself.

THREEPIO: Noisy brute. Why don't we just go into light-speed?

           Artoo beeps in response.

THREEPIO: We can't? How would you know the hyperdrive is deactivated?

           Artoo whistles knowingly.

THREEPIO: The city's central computer told you? Artoo-Detoo, you know
better than to trust a strange computer. Ouch! Pay attention to what
you're doing!

           Chewie is in the pit. He is trying to loosen something with
        an enormous wrench. Frustrated, he uses the wrench like a club
        and hits the panel...

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Leia and Lando, seated in front of the control panel, are
        suddenly sprayed by a shower of sparks.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

           Vader stands on the bridge, watching as the Millennium
        Falcon is chased by the TIE fighters. As his Destroyer draws
        nearer, Vader's breathing gets slightly faster.

VADER: Luke.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- SLEEPING QUARTERS

           Luke realizes that Vader's ship is very near. He feels
        resigned to his fate. He senses that he is beaten, more
        emotionally than physically.

LUKE: Father.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

VADER: Son, come with me.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- SLEEPING QUARTERS

LUKE: (moaning) Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Lando and Leia are at the controls of the Falcon.
        Meanwhile, in the ship's hold, Chewie continues to work
        frantically on the hyperdrive mechanism.

LANDO: (into intercom) Chewie!

EXTERIOR: SPACE

           The Falcon races through space followed very closely by the
        TIE fighters and the huge Imperial Star Destroyer.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Luke enters the cockpit and looks out the window. He is
        almost unconscious with pain and depression.

LUKE: It's Vader.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

VADER: Luke...it is your destiny.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

LUKE: Ben, why didn't you tell me?

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

PIETT: Alert all commands. Ready for the tractor beam.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- HOLD

           Artoo races to a control panel and starts working on a
        circuit board. Furious, Threepio stands on one leg, yelling.

THREEPIO: Artoo, come back at once! You haven't finished with me yet!
You don't know how to fix the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it. I'm
standing here in pieces, and you're having delusions of grandeur!

           Artoo moves a circuit on a control panel. Suddenly, the
        control panel lights up.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Leia and Lando are thrown into their seats as the
        Millennium Falcon unexpectedly shoot into hyperspace.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- HOLD

           The ship tilts up and Artoo topples into the pit on top of
        Chewie.

THREEPIO: Oh, you did it!

EXTERIOR: SPACE

           The Falcon soars into infinity and away from the huge Star
        Destroyer which seems, by contrast, to stand still.

INTERIOR: VADER'S STAR DESTROYER -- BRIDGE

           Admiral Piett and another captain glance at Vader in
        terror. Vader turns slowly and walks off the bridge, his hands
        held behind his back in a contemplative gesture.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- REBEL CRUISER

           The Millennium Falcon is attached to a huge Rebel cruiser
        by a docking tube. Rebel fighters move about the giant
        cruiser, and a Rebel transport ship hovers near the fleet.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

           Lando sits in the pilot's seat as he talks into the
        comlink. Chewie busily throws a variety of switches in
        preparation for takeoff.

LANDO: (into comlink) Luke, we're ready for takeoff.

LUKE: (over comlink) Good luck, Lando

LANDO: (into comlink) When we find Jabba the Hut and that bounty
hunter, we'll contact you.

INTERIOR: STAR CRUISER -- MEDICAL CENTER

           Luke speaking into the comlink as a medical droid works on
        his hand. Leia stands near him while Threepio and Artoo look
        out the window.

LUKE: (into comlink) I'll meet you at the rendezvous point on
Tatooine.

INTERIOR: MILLENNIUM FALCON -- COCKPIT

LANDO: (into comlink) Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.

INTERIOR: STAR CRUISER -- MEDICAL CENTER

LUKE: (into comlink) Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.

           Chewie's wail comes over the comlink.

LUKE: (into comlink) Take care, you two. May the Force be with you.

           Luke looks down at his hand. A metalized type of bandage
        has been wrapped around his wrist. The medical droid makes
        some adjustments in a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each
        one of Luke's fingers.

LUKE: Ow!

           Luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it.
        His hand is completely functional.
           He gets up and walks over to Leia. There is a new bond
        between them, a new understanding. Leia is thinking about Han;
        Luke is thinking about his uncertain and newly complicated
        future. Together they stand at the large window of the medical
        center looking out on the Rebel Star Cruiser and a dense,
        luminous galaxy swirling in space. Luke puts his arm around
        Leia. The droids stand next to them, and Threepio moves closer
        to Artoo putting his arm on him. The group watches as the
        Millennium Falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and zooms
        away into space.

EXTERIOR: SPACE -- REBEL STAR CRUISER

           While Luke, Leia, and the droids stand, looking out the
        window of the star cruiser, two escort fighters join the large
        ship. Slowly, the cruiser turns and moves away into space.

     The boundless heavens serve as a back-drop for the MAIN TITLE,
     followed by a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity.

               Episode VI:

               RETURN OF THE JEDI...
               Luke Skywalker has returned to his home
               planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue
               his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the
               vile gangster Jabba the Hutt.

               Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC
               EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a
               new armored space station even more powerful
               than the first dreaded Death Star.

               When completed, this ultimate weapon will
               spell certain doom for the small band of
               Rebels struggling to restore freedom to the
               galaxy...

     PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its
     massive superstructure curling away from the completed section
     like the arms of a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast,
     floats the small, green moon of ENDOR.

     An Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive
     armored space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A
     small Imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and
     hustles toward the Death Star.

2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT                                  2

     The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star.

                              SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
               Command station, this is ST 321. Code
               Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach.
               Deactivate the security shield.

                              DEATH STAR CONTROLLER
                              (filtered VO)
               The security deflector shield will be
               deactivated when we have confirmation of your
               code transmission. Stand by... You are clear
               to proceed.

                              SHUTTLE CAPTAIN
               We're starting our approach.

3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM                                   3

     Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR
     hits switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the
     Death Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the
     invisible deflector shield.

     A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.

                              OFFICER
               Inform the commander that Lord Vader's
               shuttle has arrived.

                              OPERATOR
               Yes, sir.

     The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the
     Imperial shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of
     Imperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.

4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY                               4

     The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident
     technocrat, strides through the assembled troops to the base of
     the shuttle ramp. The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy
     about the new arrival. But the Death Star commander stands
     arrogantly tall.

     The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only
     darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From
     this black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader
     looks over the assemblage as he walks down the ramp.

                              JERJERROD
               Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure.
               We're honored by your presence.

                              VADER
               You may dispense with the pleasantries,
               Commander. I'm here to put you back on
               schedule.

     The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.

                              JERJERROD
               I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working
               as fast as they can.

                              VADER
               Perhaps I can find new ways to
               motivate them.

                              JERJERROD
               I tell you, this station will be operational
               as planned.

                              VADER
               The Emperor does not share your
               optimistic appraisal of the situation.

                              JERJERROD
               But he asks the impossible. I need more men.

                              VADER
               Then perhaps you can tell him when he
               arrives.

                              JERJERROD (aghast)
               The Emperor's coming here?

                              VADER
               That is correct, Commander. And he is most
               displeased with your apparent lack of
               progress.

                              JERJERROD
               We shall double our efforts.

                              VADER
               I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The
               Emperor is not as forgiving as I am.

5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE                           5

     A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine
     terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply
     before catching sight of ARTOO-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making
     their way along the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the
     Hutt.

                              THREEPIO
               Of course I'm worried. And you should be,
               too. Lando Calrissian and poor Chewbacca
               never returned from this awful place.

     Artoo whistles timidly.

                              THREEPIO
               Don't be so sure. If I told you half the
               things I've heard about this Jabba the Hutt,
               You'd probably short-circuit.

     The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, are you sure this is the right place?
               I better knock, I suppose.

6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE                                       6

     Threepio looks around for some kind of signaling device, then
     timidly knocks on the iron door.

                              THREEPIO (instantly)
               There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's
               go back and tell Master Luke.

     A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery
     mechanical arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops
     out and inspects the two droids.

                              STRANGE VOICE
               Tee chuta hhat yudd!

                              THREEPIO
               Goodness gracious me!

     Threepio points to Artoo, then to himself.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd
               mischka Jabba du Hutt.

     The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then
     the eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. Artoo
     beeps his concern.

                              THREEPIO
               I don't think they're going to let us in,
               Artoo. We'd better go.

     Artoo beeps his reluctance as Threepio turns to leave. Suddenly
     the massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH.
     The robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids
     look at one another, afraid to enter.

     Artoo starts forward into the gloom. Threepio rushes after his
     stubby companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, wait. Oh, dear! Artoo. Artoo, I really
               don't think we should rush into all this.

     Artoo continues down the corridor, with Threepio following.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, Artoo!  Artoo, wait for me!

7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY                                    7

     The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the
     dark passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant,
     green GAMORREAN GUARDS, who fall in behind them. Threepio glances
     quickly back at the two lumbering brutes, then back to Artoo. One
     guard grunts an order. Artoo beeps nervously.

                              THREEPIO
               Just you deliver Master Luke's message and
               get us out of here. Oh my! Oh! Oh, no.

     Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a
     humanlike alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.

                              BIB
               Die Wanna Wanga!

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a
               message to your master, Jabba the Hutt.

     Artoo lets out a series of quick beeps.

                              THREEPIO (cont)
               ... and a gift.
               (thinks a moment, then to Artoo)
               Gift, what gift?

     Bib shakes his head negatively.

                              BIB
               Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.

     Bib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a
     bit, letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to
     the strange-looking alien.

                              THREEPIO
               He says that our instructions are to give it
               only to Jabba himself.

     Bib thinks about this for a moment.

                              THREEPIO
               I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so
               stubborn about these sort of things.

     Bib gestures for the droids to follow.

                              BIB
               Nudd Chaa.

     The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness,
     trailed by the two guards.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this.

8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM                                         8

     The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque
     CREATURES ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem
     very small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber.
     Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib
     Fortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the
     leader of this nauseating crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of
     the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a
     maniacal grin. Chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful
     alien female dancer named OOLA. At the foot of the dais sits an
     obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS CRUMB. Bib whispers
     something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba laughs
     horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows
     politely.

                              THREEPIO
               Good morning.

                              JABBA
               Bo Shuda!

     The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-
     skinned villain.

                              THREEPIO
               The message, Artoo, the message.

     Artoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head,
     creating a HOLOGRAM of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over
     ten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space
     gangsters.

                              LUKE
               Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce
               myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and
               friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are
               powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger
               with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an
               audience with Your Greatness to bargain for
               Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your
               wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an
               arrangement which will be mutually beneficial
               and enable us to avoid any unpleasant
               confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I
               present to you a gift: these two droids.

     Threepio is startled by this announcement.

                              THREEPIO
               What did he say?

                              LUKE (cont)
               ... Both are hardworking and will serve you
               well.

                              THREEPIO
               This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the
               wrong message.

     Luke's hologram disappears.

     Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               There will be no bargain.

                              THREEPIO
               We're doomed.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               I will not give up my favorite decoration. I
               like Captain Solo where he is.

     Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the
     throne. Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw
     him last, is a carbonized HAN SOLO.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still
               frozen in carbonite.

9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR                                            9

     One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a
     dank, shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of
     unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls.
     Occasionally a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the bars
     at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps pitifully.

                              THREEPIO
               What could possibly have come over Master
               Luke. Is it something I did? He never
               expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh!
               Oh! Hold it! Ohh!

     A large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to
     break free, and they move on to a door at the end of the
     corridor.

10   INT BOILER ROOM                                                10

     The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and
     noisy machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room,
     where they are met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9
     (EVE-NINEDENINE). Behind the robot can be seen a torture rack
     pulling the legs off a screaming baby work droid. A second
     power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons are
     pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized
     electronic scream. Artoo and Threepio cringe as the guard grunts
     to EV-9D9.

                              NINEDENINE
               Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a
               protocol droid, are you not?

                              THREEPIO
               I am See-Threepio, human-cy...

                              NINEDENINE
               Yes or no will do.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh. Well, yes.

                              NINEDENINE
               How many languages do you speak?

                              THREEPIO
               I am fluent in over six million forms of
               communication, and can readily...

                              NINEDENINE
               Splendid! We have been without an interpreter
               since our master got angry with our last
               protocol droid and disintegrated him.

                              THREEPIO
               Disintegrated?

                              NINEDENINE (to a Gamorrean guard)
               Guard! This protocol droid might be useful.
               Fit him with a restraining bolt and take him
               back to His Excellency's main audience
               chamber.

     The guard shoves Threepio toward the door.

                              THREEPIO (disappearing)
               Artoo, don't leave me! Ohhh!

     Artoo lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps
     angrily.

                              NINEDENINE
               You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon
               learn some respect. I have need for you on
               the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll
               fit in nicely.

     The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured
     electronic scream.

11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM                                        11

     The court of Jabba the Hutt is in the midst of a drunken, raucous
     party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola
     and a fat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.

     Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye
     beckons Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and
     backs away, shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a
     spot next to him.

                              JABBA
               Da Eitha!

     The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.

                              OOLA
               Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! Natoota...

     Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.

                              JABBA
               Boscka!

     He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door
     in the floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps
     shut, a muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and
     his monstrous friends laugh hysterically and several revelers
     hurry over to watch her fate through a grate.

     Threepio cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of
     Han Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.
     An unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far
     side of the room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow
     the approach of two guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked
     bounty hunter, leading his captive, Han Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA
     THE WOOKIEE.

     Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers
     into his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba
     listens intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster
     and speaks a greeting in a strange, electronically processed
     tongue (Ubese).

                              BOUSHH (in Ubese subtitled)
               I have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, no! Chewbacca!

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.

     Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to
     Threepio, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your
               Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!

     Jabba continues speaking, as Threepio nervously translates.
     Boushh listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room.
     He notices BOBA FETT standing near the door.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome
               and will gladly pay you the reward of twenty-
               five thousand.

                              BOUSHH (in Ubese subtitled)
               I want fifty thousand. No less.

     Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid
     off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh
     adjusts his weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio
     struggles back onto the throne. The disheveled droid tries to
     compose himself.

                              THREEPIO
               Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
               (to Boushh)
               Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay
               fifty thousand.

     The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand.
     Threepio looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the
     bounty hunter. The droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting
     very impatient.

                              THREEPIO
               Because he's holding a thermal detonator.

     The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters
     in the room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to
     glow in the bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a
     tense hush. Jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until
     a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               This bounty hunter is my kind of scum.
               Fearless and inventive.

     Jabba continues.

                              THREEPIO
               Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I
               suggest you take it.

     Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for
     his reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator
     and it goes dead.

                              BOUSHH
               Zeebuss.

                              THREEPIO
               He agrees!

     The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and
     applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca
     growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as
     a skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and
     dancing girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the
     loudly appreciative creatures.

     Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys
     the scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare
     from across the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts
     slightly, cradling his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with
     equally ominous arrogance.

12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL                                  12

     Gamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before.
     When a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious
     ROAR echoes against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into
     its cell in terror. It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie
     roughly into a cell, slamming the door behind him. Chewie lets
     out a pathetic howl and bangs on the iron door.

13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE                                             13

     The palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the
     road in front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out
     for a desert rodent and burps in satisfaction.

14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT                                14

     Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien
     celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before.
     Several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring
     loudly.

     A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the
     perimeter of the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty
     hunter. He picks his way carefully through the snoring, drunken
     monsters.

     Han Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall,
     his coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty
     hunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch
     to one side of the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the
     floor of the alcove.

     Boushh steps up to the case, studying Han, then turns to the
     controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of
     switches and, after one last, hesitant look at Han, slides the
     decarbonization lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the
     hard shell covering the contours of Han's face begins to melt
     away. The bounty hunter watches as Han's body is freed of its
     metallic coat and his forearms and hands, previously raised in
     reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His face muscles
     relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.

     Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the
     breath of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a
     start and he begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the
     staggering newborn.

                              BOUSHH
               Just relax for a moment. You're free of the
               carbonite.

     Han touches his face with his hand and moans.

                              BOUSHH
               Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.

                              HAN
               I can't see.

                              BOUSHH
               You eyesight will return in time.

                              HAN
               Where am I?

                              BOUSHH
               Jabba's palace.

                              HAN
               Who are you?

     The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head,
     revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.

                              LEIA
               Someone who loves you.

                              HAN
               Leia!

                              LEIA
               I gotta get you out of here.

     As Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet
     is pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of
     the alcove.

                              HAN
               What's that? I know that laugh.

     The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba
     the Hutt, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again,
     and his gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.

                              HAN
               Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way
               to pay you back, but I got a little
               sidetracked. It's not my fault.

     Jabba laughs.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               It's too late for that, Solo. You may have
               been a good smuggler, but now you're Bantha
               fodder.

                              HAN
               Look...

                              JABBA (cont Huttese subtitled)
               Take him away!

     The guards grab Han and start to lead him away.

                              HAN
               Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing
               away a fortune here. Don't be a fool!

     Han is dragged off, as Lando quickly moves forward and attempts
     to lead Leia away.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               Bring her to me.

     Jabba chuckles as Lando and a second guard drag the beautiful
     young princess toward him. Threepio peeks from behind a monster
     and quickly turns away in disgust.

                              LEIA
               We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret
               this...

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               I'm sure.

     Inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of
     Jabba's ugly blob of a head, and Leia turns away in disgust.

                              LEIA
               Ugh!

                              THREEPIO
               Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.

15   INT DUNGEON CELL                                               15

     The heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks
     open. A guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell
     and the door slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of
     light from a crack in the door. Han is trying to collect himself
     when suddenly a growl is heard from the far side of the cell. He
     jumps back against the cell door and listens.

                              HAN
               Chewie? Chewie, is that you?

     The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward Han,
     lifting him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into
     the light, revealing Chewie.

                              HAN
               Ah! Chew--Chewie!

     The giant Wookiee barks with glee.

                              HAN
               Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?

     Chewie barks an excited blue streak.

                              HAN
               Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care
               of himself, much less rescue anybody.

     Chewie barks a reply.

                              HAN
               A...Jedi Knight? I--I'm out of it for a
               little while, everybody gets delusions of
               grandeur.

     Chewie growls insistently. He holds Han to his chest and pets his
     head.

                              HAN
               I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.

16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE                        16

     Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding
     LIGHT and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is
     clad in a robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor
     laser sword. Luke strides purposefully into the hallway. Two
     giant guards move to block Luke's path. Luke halts.

     Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who
     immediately lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi
     lowers his hand and moves on down the hallway.

     Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they
     approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse
     his direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry
     on the conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in
     the darkness.

                              LUKE
               I must speak with Jabba.

     Bib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops
     and stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.

                              LUKE
               You will take me to Jabba now!

     Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke
     follows him into the gloom.

                              LUKE
               You serve your master well.

     Bib responds.

                              LUKE
               And you will be rewarded.

17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM                                        17

     Jabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him.
     Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now
     dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs
     from a manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba
     the Hutt. Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the
     gangster slug.

                              THREEPIO
               At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.

                              BIB
               Master.

     Jabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese.

                              BIB
               ...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               I told you not to admit him.

                              LUKE
               I must be allowed to speak.

                              BIB (in Huttese subtitled)
               He must be allowed to speak.

     Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi
               mind trick.

     Luke stares hard at Jabba.

                              LUKE
               You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee
               to me.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.

                              LUKE
               Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his
               friends. You can either profit by this... or
               be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn
               you not to underestimate my powers.

     Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke
     about the pit.

                              THREEPIO
"Master Luke, you're standing on..."

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
"There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die."

     Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and
     flies into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as
     Jabba raises his hand.

                              JABBA
"Bascka!"

     The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard
     into the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the
     ceiling. Jabba laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts
     forward but is restrained by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable
     behind his mask. She looks at him and he shakes his head "no."

18   INT RANCOR PIT                                                 18

     Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute
     into the dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard
     yells hysterically for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge
     of the pit as the door in the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE
     open. The guard screams in panic. Luke looks calmly around for a
     means of escape.

                              THREEPIO
"Oh, no! A Rancor!"

     At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant,
     fanged RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and
     tries futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes
     in on him.

     The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to
     scramble, the Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering
     jaws. A few screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The
     audience cheers and laughs at the guard's fate.

     The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young Jedi dashes away
     just ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long
     arm bone of an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings
     him up to his salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges
     the bone in the monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The
     monster bellows in rage and flails about, hitting the side of the
     pit, causing an avalanche.

     The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who
     squeezes into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the
     monster to the holding cave beyond. On the far side of the
     holding cave is a utility door--if only he can get to it. The
     Rancor spots Luke and reaches into the crevice for him. Luke
     grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it down on the
     Rancor's finger.

19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT                                    19

     The Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the
     holding cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it.
     When he succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and
     safety. Beyond the gate two guards look up from their dinner.
     Luke turns to see the monster heading for him, and pulls with all
     his might on the gate. The guards move to the gate and start
     poking at the young Jedi with spears, laughing.

     Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach
     for him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up
     the wall. As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a
     skull from the cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant
     overhead door comes crashing down on the beast's head, squashing
     it like a sledgehammer on an egg.

     A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's
     consternation at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is
     actually turning red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy.
     Jabba utters harsh commands to his guards and they hurry off.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all
               suffer for this outrage.

21   INT RANCOR PIT                                                 21

     The Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining
     their dead beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other
     glares menacingly at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush
     into the holding tunnel and take Luke away.

22   INT THRONE ROOM                                                22

     The crowd of creepy courtiers parts as Han and Chewie are brought
     into the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.

                              LUKE
               Han!

                              HAN
               Luke!

                              LUKE
               Are you all right?

                              HAN
               Fine. Together again, huh?

                              LUKE
               Wouldn't miss it.

                              HAN
               How are we doing?

                              LUKE
               The same as always.

                              HAN
               That bad, huh? Where's Leia?

     Luke looks to Leia.

                              LEIA
               I'm here.

     Threepio is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes
     Leia like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including Lando,
     bring Luke from the other side of the room. Boba is standing
     behind Jabba.

     Threepio steps forward and translates for the captives.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great
               Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to
               be terminated immediately.

                              HAN
               Good, I hate long waits.

                              THREEPIO
               You will therefore be taken to the Dune Sea
               and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting
               place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.

                              HAN (to Luke)
               Doesn't sound so bad.

                              THREEPIO
               In his belly, you will find a new definition
               of pain and suffering, as you are slowly
               digested over a thousand years.

                              HAN
               On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?

     Chewie barks his agreement.

                              LUKE
               You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the
               last mistake you'll ever make.

     Jabba cackles evilly at this.

     As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud
     cheer rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned
     looks, but Luke Skywalker, Jedi warrior, cannot suppress a smile.

23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF                                       23

     Jabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface
     accompanied by two smaller SKIFFS. One of the skiffs glides
     close, revealing Luke, Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds --
     surrounded by guards, one of whom is Lando in disguise.

                              HAN
               I think my eyes are getting better. Instead
               of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur.

                              LUKE
               There's nothing to see. I used to live here,
               you know.

                              HAN
               You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.

                              LUKE
               Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've
               taken care of everything.

     Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity
     ship. His entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and
     having a good time. Leia is watching her friends in the skiff
     when the chain attached to her neck is pulled tight and Jabba
     tugs the scantily clad princess to him.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               Soon you will learn to appreciate me.

     Threepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a
     smaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place.
     The stubby droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you
               doing here?

     Artoo beeps a quick reply.

                              THREEPIO
               Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but
               this place is dangerous. They're going to
               execute Master Luke and, if we're not
               careful, us too!

              Artoo whistles a singsong response.

                              THREEPIO
               Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.

     The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to
     one side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the
     prisoner's skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers.
     At the bottom of the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-
     lined hole, surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This
     is the SARLACC. A plank is extended from the edge of the
     prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's bonds and shove him out
     onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.

     Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans
     forward and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As
     Threepio steps up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the
     motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's
     voice is amplified across loudspeakers.

                              THREEPIO
               Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His
               Excellency hopes that you will die honorably.
               But should any of you wish to beg for mercy,
               the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to
               your pleas.

     Han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak.

                              HAN
               Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of...
               worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure
               from us. Right?

     Chewie growls his agreement.

                              LUKE
               Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or
               die.

     Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick
     look of conspiracy to him.

28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK                                28

     The assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips
     unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter
     subsides as he speaks into the comlink.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               Move him into position.

     Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.

29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK                                         29

     Artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the
     pit. Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge
     of the plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo,
     then gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been
     waiting for. A flap opens in Artoo's domed head.

                              JABBA (in Huttese subtitled)
               Put him in.

30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK                                              30

     Luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the
     bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive
     what is happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank
     by his fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and
     catapults him skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and
     drops down on the end of the plank in the same spot he just
     vacated, but facing the skiff. He casually extends an open palm
     and -- his lightsaber, which Artoo has sent arcing toward him,
     drops into his hand.

     With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who
     prodded him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming
     overboard. The other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into
     them, lightsaber flashing. Lando struggles with another guard at
     the back of the skiff.

31   EXT SARLACC PIT                                                31

     A bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and
     begins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs
     him and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.

32   INT SAIL BARGE                                                 32

     Jabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and
     the guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy
     creatures watching the action from the window are in an uproar.

33   EXT SKIFF                                                      33

     Luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting
     mouth of the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.

                              LUKE
               Easy, Chewie.

     At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of
     blasts from a big cannon on the upper deck. Lando is tossed from
     the deck of the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and
     dangles desperately above the Sarlacc pit.

                              LANDO
               Whoa! Whoa! Help!

34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE                                    34

     With two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his
     rocket pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to
     the skiff.

35   EXT SKIFF                                                      35

     Boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke,
     who has freed Han and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba
     can fire, the young Jedi spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and
     hacks the bounty hunter's gun in half.

     Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's
     deck gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and Han are thrown
     against the rail.

                              HAN
               Chewie, you okay? Where is he?

     The Wookiee is wounded and he howls in pain.

                              HAN
               I'm okay, pal.

     For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires
     a cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in
     a strong cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm
     free only from the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber
     points straight up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke
     shrugs away the cable and stands free.

     Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is
     knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where Lando is hanging.

                              LANDO
               Han! Chewie?

                              HAN
               Lando!

     Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade
     brackets him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their
     weapons, moves in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming
     second skiff. The young Jedi leaps into the middle of the second
     skiff and begins decimating the guards from their midst.

     Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to
     Han, guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of
     the guards. Han searches the deck as Chewie barks directions;
     finally he grabs hold of the spear.

     Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at
     the other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba
     raises his arm, and aims his lethal appendage.

     Chewie barks desperately at Han.

                              HAN
               Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?

     The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his
     hand whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.

     The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba
     blasts off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing
     against the side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the
     pit. He screams as his armored body makes its last flight past
     Lando and directly into the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The
     Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a weak congratulations to Han.

     Leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne,
     and throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his
     bulbous neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne,
     pulling the chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck
     contracts beneath the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from
     their sockets and his scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted
     Hutt's huge tail spasms through its death throes and then slams
     down into final stillness. Leia struggles to free herself of her
     bondage.

37   EXT SKIFF                                                      37

     Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han
     extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling
     precariously from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.

                              HAN
               Lando, grab it!

                              LANDO
               Lower it!

                              HAN
               I'm trying!

     A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side.
     Han and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The
     rope breaks, and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit.
     Luckily, Han's foot catches on the skiff railing and he dangles
     above Lando and the pit. The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff
     for dear life as another hit from the deck gun rocks the skiff
     violently.

                              HAN
               Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.

     Chewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han
     extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of
     the pit.

                              HAN
               Grab it! L--Lando. Grab!

     Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the
     deck gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps
     from the skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side
     of the Sail Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a
     painful climb up the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a
     window an inch from his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the
     wrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the broken
     window and into the deadly pit.

     The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling
     Han, who is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate
     Lando. The Baron has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of
     the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. Every time he tries to reach
     for Han, the loose sand moves him closer to his final reward.

                              HAN
               Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!

     Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando
     to let go of the spear.

                              LANDO
               Hold it! Whoa!

     Again Han extends the spear toward Lando.

                              HAN
               Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy.
               Hold me, Chewie.

     Lando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly
     around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.

                              HAN
               Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move,
               Lando.

                              LANDO
               No, wait! I thought you were blind!

                              HAN
               It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.

                              LANDO
               All right! A little higher! Just a little
               higher!

     Han adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed
     pirate fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases
     Lando, and Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.

                              HAN
               Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up,
               Chewie, up!

38   EXT UPPER DECK                                                 38

     The deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human
     chain in their gun sights when something up on deck commands
     their attention: Luke, standing before them like a pirate king,
     ignites his lightsaber. The deck gunners have barely reached for
     their pistols before the young Jedi has demolished them.
     Immediately, Luke turns to see two more gunners (who have been
     uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) racing for him,
     firing their laser pistols.

39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK                              39

     Leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo
     zips through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the
     stubby little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the
     chain apart.

                              LEIA
               Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.

     Artoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is
     kicking and screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey-
     monster picks out one of the golden droid's eyes.

                              THREEPIO
               Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh!
               Ohhh! You beast!

     Artoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a
     scream, crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio
     (with his eye dangling from a wire) hurry off.

40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE                                    40

     Luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded
     by guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck
     as Luke turns to face another guard.

                              LUKE (to Leia)
               Get the gun! Point it at the deck!

     Leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and
     swivels the gun around.

                              LUKE
               Point it at the deck!

     A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in
     pain, but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the
     last of the guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals
     the mechanism. He flexes the hand; it still works.

     Near the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady
     themselves as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't
               possibly jump.

     Artoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself,
     tumbling toward the sand.

     Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun,
     which she has brought around to point down at the deck.

                              LUKE
               Come on!

     Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He
     gathers Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck
     gun. The gun explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out
     toward the skiff.

41   EXT SKIFF                                                      41

     Han leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the
     deck. Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.

                              LUKE
               Let's go! And don't forget the droids.

                              LANDO
               We're on our way.

     The Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of
     the huge craft is on fire.

     Threepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed.
     Next to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand.
     The skiff floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle
     down on a wire. With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled from
     the sand.

     The little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which
     continues its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across
     the desert, the barge settles to the sand and disappears in one
     final conflagration.

44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA                                    44

     A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we
     HEAR THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil
     of sand, pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and
     Threepio, followed by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come
     into view, each supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca,
     who hobbles from his wound.

     Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing
     sand. It is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's
     trusty X-wing and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be
     heard.

                              HAN
               I don't know. All I can see is a lot of
               blowing sand!

                              LEIA
               That's all any of us can see.

                              HAN (blinking)
               Then I guess I'm getting better.

     As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the
     wind dies down to something more describable as a severe weather
     condition. Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with
     a HUM.

                              HAN (turning to Luke)
               I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were
               pretty good out there.

                              LUKE (shrugging it off)
               I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.

                              HAN
               No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon
               freeze was the closest thing to dead there
               is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big
               wide awake nothing!

     Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi
     warrior, mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly
     hugs him.

                              LUKE (moving to his ship)
               I'll see you back at the fleet.

                              HAN
               Why don't you leave that crate and come with
               us?

                              LUKE
               I have a promise I have to keep first... to
               an old friend.

     Luke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft.

                              HAN
               (looking dubiously at Lando, obviously
               remembering his friend's betrayal and
               subsequent aide)
               Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando.

                              LANDO
               Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd
               just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so
               I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or
               later.

                              LEIA
               He means "You're welcome."

                              LANDO
               Come on, let's get off this miserable dust
               ball.

44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE                                      44A

     The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing
     appears and peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON
     appears as a dot and grows huge, to roar directly over the
     CAMERA.

45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT                                           45

     Luke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside
     the canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the
     MILLENNIUM FALCON.

                              LUKE
               I'll meet you back at the fleet.

                              LEIA (over comlink)
               Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by
               now.

                              LUKE
               I will.

                              HAN (over comlink)
               Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after
               me. Now I owe you one.

     A message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front
     of Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he
     pulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.

                              LUKE
     That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a
     promise to keep... to an old friend.

46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR                               46

     A Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet
     rest in space above the half-completed Death Star and its green
     neighbor, Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial
     shuttle toward the Death Star.

47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY                       47

     Lord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very
     nervous Death Star commander.

48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR                                   48

     Thousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth
     docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform,
     where the shuttle is coming to rest.

     The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out
     and create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid
     attention with a momentous SNAP.

     Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He
     is a rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes
     its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a
     hooded cloak similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is
     black. The Emperor's face is shrouded and difficult to see,
     except for his piercing yellow eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and
     Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme Ruler of the galaxy beckons
     to the Dark Lord.

                              EMPEROR (to Vader)
               Rise, my friend.

     Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes
     his way along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other
     commanders stay kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader,
     followed by several Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do
     they join in the procession.

                              VADER
               The Death Star will be completed on schedule.

                              EMPEROR
               You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I
               sense you wish to continue your search for
               young Skywalker.

                              VADER
               Yes, my Master.

                              EMPEROR
               Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you
               out. And when he does, you must bring him
               before me. He has grown strong. Only together
               can we turn him to the dark side of the
               Force.

                              VADER
               As you wish.

                              EMPEROR
               Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.

     He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial
     troops.

49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH                                     49

     Once again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp
     environs of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it.
     He beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's
     cottage. Warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to
     fight the gloom.

50   INT YODA'S HOUSE                                               50

     The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen
     floor of the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small
     green hand that clutches it, and then to the familiar face of
     YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. His manner is frail, and his voice, though
     cheerful, seems weaker.

                              YODA
               Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to
               young eyes?

     Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his
     look has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.

                              LUKE
               No... of course not.

                              YODA (tickled, chuckles)
               I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and
               weak. (Points a crooked finger) When nine
               hundred years old you reach, look as good you
               will not. Hmm?

     Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.

                              YODA
               Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned
               it, I have.

     Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.

                              LUKE
               Master Yoda, you can't die.

                              YODA
               Strong am I with the Force... but not that
               strong! Twilight is upon me and soon night
               must fall. That is the way of things ... the
               way of the Force.

                              LUKE
               But I need your help. I've come back to
               complete the training.

                              YODA
               No more training do you require. Already know
               you that which you need.

     Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.

                              LUKE
               Then I am a Jedi?

                              YODA (shakes his head)
               Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You
               must confront Vader. Then, only then, a Jedi
               will you be. And confront him you will.

     Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his
     courage. Finally he is able to ask.

                              LUKE
               Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?

     Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad
     smile creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from
     Luke.

                              YODA
               Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.

     Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.

                              LUKE
               Yoda, I must know.

                              YODA
               Your father he is.

     Luke reacts as if cut.

                              YODA
               Told you, did he?

                              LUKE
               Yes.

     A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.

                              YODA
               Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...

                              LUKE
               Unfortunate that I know the truth?

     Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.

                              YODA (gathering all his strength)
               No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face
               him... that incomplete was your training. Not
               ready for the burden were you.

                              LUKE
               Well, I'm sorry.

                              YODA
               Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the
               Force.  But beware.  Anger, fear, aggression.
               The dark side are they.  Once you start down
               the dark path, forever will it dominate your
               destiny.

     He beckons the young Jedi closer to him.

                              YODA
               Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate
               the powers of the Emperor, or suffer your
               father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
               (cough), the last of the Jedi will you be.
               Luke, the Force runs strong in your family.
               Pass on what you have learned, Luke... (with
               great effort) There is...
               another...Sky...Sky...walker.

     He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green
     creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he
     disappears in front of his eyes.

51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING                                     51

     Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a
     greeting, but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels
     down, begins to help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes
     his head dejectedly.

                              LUKE
               I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone.

                              BEN (OS)
               Yoda will always be with you.

     Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.

                              LUKE
               Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?

     The ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp.

                              LUKE
               You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my
               father.

                              BEN
               You father was seduced by the dark side of
               the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker
               and became Darth Vader. When that happened,
               the good man who was your father was
               destroyed. So what I have told you was
               true... from a certain point of view.

                              LUKE (turning away, derisive)
               A certain point of view!

                              BEN
               Luke, you're going to find that many of the
               truths we cling to depend greatly on our own
               point of view.

     Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.

                              BEN
               I don't blame you for being angry. If I was
               wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't
               have been for the first time. You see, what
               happened to your father was my fault.

     Ben pauses sadly.

                              BEN
               Anakin was a good friend.

     Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on
     a stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting
     presence.

                              BEN
               When I first knew him, your father was
               already a great pilot. But I was amazed how
               strongly the Force was with him.  I took it
               upon myself to train him as a Jedi.  I
               thought that I could instruct him just as
               well as Yoda.  I was wrong.  My pride has
               had terrible consequences for the galaxy.

     Luke is entranced.

                              LUKE
               There's still good in him.

                              BEN
               I also thought he could be turned back to the
               good side. It couldn't be done. He is more
               machine now than man. Twisted and evil.

                              LUKE
               I can't do it, Ben.

                              BEN
               You cannot escape your destiny.

                              LUKE
               I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.

                              BEN
               Vader humbled you when first you met him,
               Luke...but that experience was part of your
               training. It taught you, among other things,
               the value of patience.  Had you not been so
               impatient to defeat Vader then, you could
               have finished your training here with Yoda.
               You would have been prepared.

                              LUKE
               But I had to help my friends.

                              BEN (grinning at Luke's indignation)
               And did you help them? It was they who had to
               save you. You achieved little by rushing back
               prematurely, I fear.

                              LUKE (with sadness)
               I found out Darth Vader was my father.

                              BEN
               To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and
               then go beyond the dark side - the side your
               father couldn't get past. Impatience is
               the easiest door - for you, like your father.
               Only, your father was seduced by what he
               found on the other side of the door, and you
               have held firm. You're no longer so reckless
               now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And
               now, you must face Darth Vader again!

                              LUKE
               I can't kill my own father.

                              BEN
               Then the Emperor has already won. You were
               our only hope.

                              LUKE
               Yoda spoke of another.

                              BEN
               The other he spoke of is your twin sister.

                              LUKE
               But I have no sister.

                              BEN
               Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor,
               you were hidden from your father when you
               were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if
               Anakin were to have any offspring, they would
               be a threat to him. That is the reason why
               your sister remains safely anonymous.

                              LUKE
               Leia! Leia's my sister.

                              BEN
               Your insight serves you well. Bury your
               feelings deep down, Luke. They do you credit.
               But they could be made to serve the Emperor.

     Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.

                              BEN (continuing his narrative)
               When your father left, he didn't know your
               mother was pregnant. Your mother and I knew
               he would find out eventually, but we wanted
               to keep you both as safe as possible, for as
               long as possible.  So I took you to live with
               my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother
               took Leia to live as the daughter of Senator
               Organa, on Alderaan.

     Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.

                              BEN (attempting to give solace with his words)
               The Organa household was high-born and
               politically quite powerful in that system.
               Leia became a princess by virtue of
               lineage... no one knew she'd been adopted, of
               course. But it was a title without real
               power, since Alderaan had long been a
               democracy.  Even so, the family continued to
               be politically powerful, and Leia, following
               in her foster father's path, became a senator
               as well.  That's not all she became, of
               course... she became the leader of her cell
               in the Alliance against the corrupt Empire.
               And because she had diplomatic immunity, she
               was a vital link for getting information to
               the Rebel cause.  That's what she was doing
               when her path crossed yours... for her foster
               parents had always told her to contact me on
               Tatooine, if her troubles became desperate.

     Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of
     his sister.

                              LUKE
               But you can't let her get involved now, Ben.
               Vader will destroy her.

                              BEN
               She hasn't been trained in the ways of the
               Jedi the way you have, Luke ... but the Force
               is strong with her, as it is with all of your
               family. There is no avoiding the battle. You
               must face and destroy Vader!

52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET                                        52

     The vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see.
     Overhead a dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation.
     Fighters and battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel
     Star Cruisers, the HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.

53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM                  53

     Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled
     in the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room
     is a holographic model depicting the half-completed Imperial
     Death Star, the nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting
     deflector shield.

     MON MOTHMA, the leader of the Alliance, enters the room. She is a
     stern but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are
     several military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL
     ACKBAR (a salmon-colored Mon Calamari). Lando moves through the
     crowd until he finds Han and Chewie, standing next to Leia and
     the two droids.

     Han peers at Lando's new insignia on his chest, and is amused.

                              HAN
               Well, look at you, a general, huh?

                              LANDO
               Oh, well, someone must have told them about
               my little maneuver at the battle of Taanab.

                              HAN (sarcastic)
               Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you
               were a fair pilot. I didn't know they were
               lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy
               attack.

                              LANDO (smiling)
               I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.

                              HAN
               Well, who says they didn't.  But I
               ain't crazy. You're the respectable
               one, remember?

     Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls
     silent.

                              MON MOTHMA
               The Emperor has made a critical error and the
               time for our attack has come.

     This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of
     the Death Star, the Endor moon and the protecting deflector
     shield in the center of the room.

                              MON MOTHMA
               The data brought to us by the Bothan spies
               pinpoints the exact location of the Emperor's
               new battle station. We also know that the
               weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet
               operational. With the Imperial Fleet spread
               throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to
               engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But
               most important of all, we've learned that the
               Emperor himself is personally overseeing the
               final stages of the construction of this
               Death Star.

     A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. Han turns to
     Leia as Chewie barks his amazement.

                              MON MOTHMA (cont)
               Many Bothans died to bring us this
               information. Admiral Ackbar, please.

     Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to the Death Star's force
     field and the Moon of Endor.

                              ACKBAR
               You can see here the Death Star orbiting the
               forest Moon of Endor. Although the weapon
               systems on this Death Star are not yet
               operational, the Death Star does have a
               strong defense mechanism. It is protected by
               an energy shield, which is generated from the
               nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield must
               be deactivated if any attack is to be
               attempted. Once the shield is down, our
               cruisers will create a perimeter, while the
               fighters fly into the superstructure and
               attempt to knock out the main reactor.

     There's a concerned murmur.

                              ACKBAR (cont)
               General Calrissian has volunteered to lead
               the fighter attack

     Han turns to Lando with a look of respect.

                              HAN
               Good luck.

     Lando nods his thanks.

                              HAN
               You're gonna need it.

                              ACKBAR
               General Madine.

     Madine moves center stage.

                              GENERAL MADINE
               We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle.
               Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret
               Imperial code, a strike team will land on the
               moon and deactivate the shield generator.

     The assembly begins to mumble among themselves.

                              THREEPIO
               Sounds dangerous.

                              LEIA (to Han)
               I wonder who they found to pull that off.

                              GENERAL MADINE
               General Solo, is your strike team assembled?

     Leia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration.

                              HAN
               Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command
               crew for the shuttle.

     Chewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at
     him.

                              HAN
               Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want
               to speak for you.

     Chewie waves that off with a huge GROWL.

                              HAN (smiles)
               That's one.

                              LEIA
               Uh, General... count me in.

                              VOICE (OS)
               I'm with you, too!

     They turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are
     more cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands
     Luke. Han and Leia are surprised and delighted.

     Leia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change
     in him and looks into his eyes questioningly.

                              LEIA
               What is it?

                              LUKE (hesitant)
               Ask me again sometime.

     Han, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks
     up.

                              HAN
               Luke.

                              LUKE
               Hi, Han... Chewie.

     Artoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio.

                              THREEPIO
               "Exciting" is hardly the word I would use.

54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY                    54

     The Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE,
     which looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast
     docking bay. Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads
     Artoo and Threepio up the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel
     strike team loading weapons and supplies. Lando turns to face
     Han. Luke and Leia have said their good-byes and start up the
     ramp.

                              HAN
               Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take
               her. You need all the help you can get. She's
               the fastest ship in the fleet.

                              LANDO
               All right, old buddy. You know, I know what
               she means to you. I'll take good care of her.
               She-she won't get a scratch. All right?

                              HAN (looks at him warmly)
               Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch.

                              LANDO
               Look, would you get going, you pirate.

     Han and Lando pause, then exchange salutes.

                              LANDO
               Good luck.

                              HAN
               You, too.

     Han goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns
     away.

55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT                                 55

     Luke is working on a back control panel as Han comes in and takes
     the pilot's seat. Chewie, in the seat next to him, is trying to
     figure out all the Imperial controls.

                              HAN
               You got her warmed?

                              LUKE
               Yeah, she's comin' up.

     Chewie growls a complaint.

                              HAN
               No. I don't think the Empire had Wookiees in
               mind when they designed her, Chewie.

     Leia comes in from the hold and takes her seat near Luke.

     Chewie barks and hits some switches. Han's glance has stuck on
     something out the window: the Millennium Falcon. Leia nudges him
     gently.

                              LEIA
               Hey, are you awake?

                              HAN
               Yeah, I just got a funny feeling. Like I'm
               not gonna see her again.

     Chewie, hearing this, stops his activity and looks longingly out
     at the Falcon, too. Leia puts a hand on Han's shoulder.

                              LEIA (softly)
               Come on, General, let's move.

     Han snaps back to life.

                              HAN
               Right. Chewie, let's see what this piece of
               junk can do. Ready, everybody?

                              LUKE
               All set.

                              THREEPIO
               Here we go again.

                              HAN
               All right, hang on.

56   EXT SPACE - THE REBEL FLEET                                    56

     The stolen Imperial shuttle leaves the main docking bay of the
     Headquarters Frigate, lowers its wings into flight position, and
     zooms off into space.

57   INT EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM                                      57

     The converted control room is dimly lit, except for a pool of
     light at the far end. There the Emperor sits in an elaborate
     control chair before a large window which looks out across the
     half-completed Death Star to the giant green moon of Endor.

     Darth Vader, standing with other members of the Imperial council,
     cautiously approaches his master. The ruler's back is to Vader.
     After several tense moments, the Emperor's chair rotates around
     to face him.

                              VADER
               What is thy bidding, my Master?

                              EMPEROR
               Send the fleet to the far side of Endor.
               There it will stay until called for.

                              VADER
               What of the reports of the Rebel fleet
               massing near Sullust?

                              EMPEROR
               It is of no concern. Soon the Rebellion will
               be crushed and young Skywalker will be one of
               us! Your work here is finished, my friend. Go
               out to the command ship and await my orders.

                              VADER
               Yes, my Master.

     Vader bows, then turns and exits the throne room as the Emperor
     walks toward the waiting council members.

58   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR - MOON                                  58

     There is a great deal of Imperial traffic in the area as
     construction proceeds on the Death Star. Transports, TIE
     fighters, and a few Star Destroyers move about. Now the huge
     Super Star Destroyer announces itself with a low roar and soon
     fills the frame.

59   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT                          59

     Han looks back at Luke and Leia as Chewie flips several switches.
     Through the viewscreen, the Death Star and the huge Super Star
     Destroyer can be seen.

                              HAN
               If they don't go for this, we're gonna have
               to get outta here pretty quick, Chewie.

     Chewie growls his agreement.

     Leia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed
     transmission begins.

                              LEIA
               Now we find out if that code is worth the
               price we paid.

                              HAN
               It'll work. It'll work.

     Chewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star
     Destroyer that looms ever larger before them.

                              LUKE
               Vader's on that ship.

                              HAN
               Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot
               of command ships. Keep your distance though,
               Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to
               keep your distance.

     Chewie barks a question.

                              HAN
               I don't know.  Fly casual.

                              LUKE
               I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have
               come.

                              HAN
               It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's
               keep a little optimism here.

     Chewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger
     out the window.

60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE                            60

     Lord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death
     Star. Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn.
     After a moment of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers
     to where ADMIRAL PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the
     controller we've seen earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's
     approach.

                              VADER
               Where is that shuttle going?

                              PIETT (into comlink)
               Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and
               destination?

                              PILOT VOICE (HAN)(filtered)
               Parts and technical crew for the forest moon.

     The Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction.

                              VADER
               Do they have a code clearance?

                              PIETT
               It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I
               was about to clear them.

     Vader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence.

                              PIETT
               Shall I hold them?

                              VADER
               No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them
               myself.

                              PIETT (surprised)
               As you wish, my lord.
               (to controller) Carry on.

     Piett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink.

61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT                          61

     The group waits tensely.

                              HAN
               They're not goin' for it, Chewie.

                              CONTROLLER (filtered)
               Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield
               will commence immediately. Follow your
               present course.

     Everyone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks
     worried. Chewie barks.

                              HAN
               Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No
               problem.

62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR                    62

     The stolen Imperial shuttle moves off toward the green Sanctuary
     Moon.

63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR                                63

     The stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's
     dark, primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees.

     On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way
     up a steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and
     Luke. The troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and
     Threepio bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps.

     Up ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop
     suddenly to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop.
     Han and Luke crawl up to take a look.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, I told you it was dangerous here.

     THEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering
     through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are
     parked nearby.

                              LEIA
               Shall we try and go around?

                              HAN
               It'll take time. This whole party'll be for
               nothing if they see us.

     Leia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and
     Chewie start quietly down.

64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE                                 64

     The four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not
     far from the two Imperial scouts.

                              HAN
               Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay
               here.

                              LUKE
               Quietly, there might be more of them out
               there.

                              HAN (grins)
               Hey... it's me.

     Han and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the
     scouts. Luke and Leia exchange smiles.

     Han sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the
     scout whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his
     companion.

                              SCOUT #1
               Go for help! Go!

     The second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but
     Chewie gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the
     scout to crash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing
     fistfight.

                              LUKE (sarcastic)
               Great. Come on.

     Luke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser
     pistol drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and
     points to where two more scouts are sitting on their speeder
     bikes, with an unoccupied bike parked nearby.

                              LEIA
               Over there! Two more of them!

                              LUKE
               I see them. Wait, Leia!

     But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder
     bike. She starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike
     behind her.

                              LUKE (pointing to the controls)
               Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!

     Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely
     avoiding two huge trees.

                              HAN
               Hey, wait! Ahhh!

     He flips the remaining scout to the ground.

65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE                                    65

     The two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia
     pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire
     from their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving
     targets.

                              LUKE
               Move closer!

     Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer
     through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a
     tree, slowing the scout.

                              LUKE
               Get alongside that one!

     Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that
     their steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to
     the back of the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the
     neck, and flips him off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke
     gains control of the bike and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead.
     They tear off after the remaining scout.

                              LUKE
               Get him!

     The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two
     swing into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their
     laser cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike
     takes a glancing hit.

                              LUKE (indicating the one ahead)
               Keep on that one! I'll take these two!

     With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes
     into the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing
     scouts as they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike
     into forward and starts firing away, having switched places with
     his pursuers in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one
     scout's bike is blasted out of control. It explodes against a
     tree trunk.

     The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts
     into turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.

     FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom
     through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward
     and rises out of sight.

     The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer.
     Suddenly, Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting.
     The scout's bike takes a glancing hit.

     Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him,
     reaches down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the
     scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives
     off as her bike explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks
     back at the explosion. But when he turns forward again, he is on
     a collision course with a giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes
     to no avail and disappears in a conflagration.

     ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout
     continue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up
     close. The scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A
     fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout zips
     under. Luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the
     scout's. Both riders look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in
     Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside him makes it almost
     impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all his might,
     leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able to
     make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and
     the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes
     and are moving as one.

     Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively
     and dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before
     Luke's explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles
     back to find Luke.

     Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him
     and opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser
     sword and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps
     coming and it appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half.
     At the last instant, Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's
     control vanes with one mighty slash. The scout's bike begins to
     shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to slam directly
     into a tree in a giant ball of fire.

66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST                                    66

     Han, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad,
     wait anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out
     of his domed head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!

     Han, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.

     Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him.
     He's too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and
     looks around.

                              HAN
               Luke! Where's Leia?

                              LUKE (concerned)
               What? She didn't come back?

                              HAN
               I thought she was with you.

                              LUKE
               We got separated.

     Luke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily.

                              LUKE
               Hey, we better go look for her.

     Han nods, and signals to a Rebel officer.

                              HAN
               Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the
               shield generator at 0300.

                              LUKE
               Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners.

     Luke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as
     the squad proceeds in another.

                              THREEPIO
               Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to
               do.

     They move off into the woods.

                              THREEPIO (to Artoo)
               And you said it was pretty here. Ugh!

67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE                        67

     A strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly
     into view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He
     seems somewhat puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess
     groans; this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her
     again. Leia sits up and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She
     tries to figure out where she is and what has happened. Her
     clothes are torn; she's bruised and disheveled.

     The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he
     holds in a defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles
     warily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear.

                              LEIA
               Cut it out!

     She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.

                              LEIA
               I'm not gonna hurt you.

     Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains
     of her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen
     log.

                              LEIA
               Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is,
               I don't know where here is.

     She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness
     from her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and
     pats the log beside her.

                              LEIA
               Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit
               down.

     Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy.
     Leia pats the log again.

                              LEIA
               I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.

     More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.

                              LEIA
               All right. You want something to eat?

     She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him.
     Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves
     cautiously toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.

                              LEIA
               That's right. Come on. Hmmm?

     Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits
     on the log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little
     creature jumps back, startled again. He runs along the log,
     pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak. Leia
     holds out the helmet to him.

                              LEIA
               Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you.
               Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't
               you?

     Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log,
     coming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and
     he begins to sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering
     some Ewokese warning to Leia.

                              LEIA
               What is it?

     Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on
     the log next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the
     log, hiding behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while
     Wicket disappears underneath the log. Another shot, and still no
     sight of anyone in the forest. Then Leia senses something and
     turns to find a large IMPERIAL SCOUT standing over her with his
     weapon pointed at her head. He reaches out his hand for her
     weapon.

                              SCOUT #l
               Freeze!  Come on, get up!

     She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the
     foliage in front of the log.

                              SCOUT #1
               Go get your ride and take her back to base.

                              SCOUT #2
               Yes, sir.

     The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched
     under the log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the
     leg. The scout jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down
     at Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She
     dives for his laser pistol, and the second scout, now on his
     bike, takes off. Leia fires away and hits the escaping bike,
     causing it to crash into the first scout's bike, which flies end
     over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once more. Wicket
     pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards Leia with
     new respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking
     around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into
     the dense foliage.

                              LEIA
               Come on, let's get outta here.

     As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks
     and tugs at Leia to follow him.

68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER                   68

     Darth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and
     private elevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's
     path.

                              GUARD
               Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be
               disturbed at the moment.

                              VADER
               (raising his gloved hand to the two guards
               and choking them with the Force)
               The Emperor will see me, now!

                              GUARD

               The Emperor will see you, now.

69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM                              69

     Two red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door
     opens to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne
     room. It appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches
     the throne. He waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his
     back to the Dark Lord.

                              EMPEROR
               I told you to remain on the command ship.

                              VADER
               A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield
               and landed on Endor.

                              EMPEROR (no surprise)
               Yes, I know.

                              VADER (after a beat)
               My son is with them.

                              EMPEROR (very cool)
               Are you sure?

                              VADER
               I have felt him, my Master.

                              EMPEROR
               Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your
               feelings on this matter are clear, Lord
               Vader.

     Vader knows what is being asked.

                              VADER
               They are clear, my Master.

                              EMPEROR
               Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and
               wait for them.

                              VADER (skeptical)
               He will come to me?

                              EMPEROR
               I have foreseen it. His compassion for you
               will be his undoing. He will come to you and
               then you will bring him before me.

                              VADER (bows)
               As you wish.

     The Dark Lord strides out of the throne room.

70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE                        70

     Han, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move
     through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw
     Leia. Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of
     concern.

                              HAN (OS)
               Luke! Luke!

     Luke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred
     wreckage of a speeder bike in the grass.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, Master Luke.

                              LUKE
               There's two more wrecked speeders back there.
               And I found this.

     He tosses the helmet to Han.

                              THREEPIO
               I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no
               trace of Princess Leia.

                              HAN (gravely)
               I hope she's alright.

     Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off
     through the foliage.

                              HAN
               What, Chewie? What? Chewie!

     The others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots
     along, Artoo whistles nervously.

71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE                                     71

     The group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up
     to a tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal
     hanging from it.

                              HAN
               Hey, I don't get it.

     The rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake.

                              HAN (cont)
               Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.

     Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.

                              LUKE
               Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!

     Too late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the
     stake. SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an
     Ewok net, suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a
     wild series of beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret.
     Their bodies are a jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw
     from his mouth.

                              HAN
               Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always
               thinking with your stomach.

                              LUKE
               Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out
               a way to get out of this thing. (trying to
               free an arm) Han, can you reach my
               lightsaber?

                              HAN
               Yeah, sure.

     Artoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his
     cutting appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to
     squeeze an arm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net
     continues to spin.

                              THREEPIO
               Artoo, I'm not sure that's such a good idea.
               It's a very long dro-o-op!!

     Artoo has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the
     net, crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and
     sit up, they realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks,
     each brandishing a long spear.

                              HAN
               Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace
               else.

     Han pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a
     second Ewok warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear
     returns to Han's face. He grabs it angrily and starts to go for
     his laser pistol.

                              HAN
               Hey!

                              LUKE
               Han, don't. It'll be all right.

     The Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke
     lets them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry
     critters.

                              LUKE
               Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.

     Artoo and Threepio are just untangling themselves. Threepio gets
     free of the net and sits up, rattled.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!

     When the Ewoks see Threepio, they let out a gasp and chatter
     among themselves. Threepio speaks to them in their native tongue.
     The Ewok nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself
     before the droid. In a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit.
     Chewie lets out a puzzled bark. Han and Luke regard the bowed
     creatures in wonder. The Ewoks begin to chant at Threepio.

                              LUKE
               Do you understand anything they're saying?

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am
               fluent in over six million forms of
               communication.

                              HAN
               What are you telling them?

                              THREEPIO
               Hello, I think... I could be mistaken.
               They're using a very primitive dialect.  But
               I do believe they think I am some sort of god.

     Chewbacca and Artoo think that's very funny. Han and Luke
     exchange "what next?" looks.

                              HAN
               Well, why don't you use your divine influence
               and get us out of this?

                              THREEPIO
               I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that
               just wouldn't be proper.

                              HAN
               Proper?!

                              THREEPIO
               It's against my programming to impersonate a
               deity.

     Han moves toward Threepio threateningly.

                              HAN
               Why, you--

     Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in Han's face at the affront to
     their god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and Han is
     surrounded by a menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He
     holds up his hands placatingly.

                              HAN
               My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.

72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS                                   72

     A procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest.
     Their prisoners - Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo - are tied to long
     poles and wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.

     Each pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind
     the captives, Threepio is carried on a litter, like a king, by
     the remaining creatures.

73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST                               73

     The procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high
     in the giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which
     drops off into nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a
     village of mud huts and rickety walkways, attached to the giant
     trees. The lead Ewok takes hold of a long vine and swings across
     to the village square; the other Ewoks follow suit.

74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE                                        74

     The procession winds its way into the village square. Mother
     Ewoks gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the
     sight of the newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.

     Han, Luke, Chewie, and Artoo are still bound to their poles. Han
     is placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the
     others are leaned against a tree nearby. Threepio's litter/throne
     is gently placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination.
     Han, Luke, and Chewie are less than fascinated.

                              HAN
               I have a really bad feeling about this.

     Chewie growls his concern.

     Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man,
     comes out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully,
     goes to join Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an
     elevated platform. A larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is
     examining Luke's lightsaber with great curiosity.

     Logray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks,
     pointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin
     filling the pit under Han with firewood.

                              HAN
               What did he say?

                              THREEPIO
               I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it
               appears you are to be the main course at a
               banquet in my honor.

     The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the
     large hut. Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees
     what's happening at the same moment the prisoners see her.

                              HAN and LUKE
               Leia!

     As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised
     spears.

                              LEIA
               Oh!

                              THREEPIO
               Your Royal Highness.

     Artoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the
     assembled Ewoks and sighs.

                              LEIA
               But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them
               they must be set free.

     Threepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their
     heads negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners
     and barks some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood
     on the barbecue with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke
     and Han.

                              HAN
               Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help
               us very much.

                              LUKE
               Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you
               wish, you'll become angry and use your magic.

                              THREEPIO
               But Master Luke, what magic? couldn't
               possibly --

                              LUKE
               Just tell them.

     Threepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray
     steps forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and
     begins to concentrate.

                              THREEPIO
               You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me.
               Just...

     Now the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from
     the ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking.

                              THREEPIO
               ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's
               happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh!

     The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now
     Threepio begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool,
     with Threepio calling out in total panic at his situation.

                              THREEPIO
               Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo!
               Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo!
               Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh!
               Ohhh!

     Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and
     release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group
     embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping
     up at him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to
     the ground. Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo
     crashes to the ground. When the Ewoks set him upright, the little
     droid is fighting mad. Artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest
     Ewok, and begins pursuing him, finally getting close enough to
     zap him with an electric charge. The Ewok jumps two feet in the
     air and runs away, screaming. A small group of Ewoks surround the
     giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and marveling at his
     height.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.

                              LUKE
               Thanks, Threepio.

                              THREEPIO (still shaken)
               I...I never knew I had it in me.

75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS                            75

     A glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged
     room, creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one
     side, a group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on
     his throne. The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with
     Threepio between the two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one
     side.

     Threepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's
     squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and
     occasionally murmur comments to each other. Threepio points
     several times at the Rebel group and pantomimes a short history
     of the Galactic Civil War, mimicking the explosion and rocket
     sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. Throughout the long account,
     certain familiar names are distinguishable in English: Princess
     Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Artoo
     begins beeping excitedly at Threepio.

                              THREEPIO
               Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that.

     Threepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader,
     Han Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the
     present time.

     At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then
     nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.

     The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great
     cheer and screeches.

                              HAN
               What's going on?

                              LEIA
               I don't know.

     Luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now
     something passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The
     others do not notice.

                              THREEPIO
               Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.

     Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the Rebels.

                              HAN
               Just what I always wanted.

     Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while
     Wicket clings to Han's leg.

                              HAN (chuckles)
               Well, short help is better than no help at
               all, Chewie. (to Wicket) Thank you. Okay.

                              THREEPIO
               He says the scouts are going to show us the
               quickest way to the shield generator.

     Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he
     wanders outside into the moonlight. Leia notices and follows.

                              HAN
               Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some
               fresh supplies, too. And try and get our
               weapons back.

     Han pulls Threepio back as he keeps trying to translate.

                              HAN (cont)
               And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.

76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT                                       76

     The walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow
     and flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill
     the soft night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut
     and stands staring up at the Death Star. Leia finds him like
     that.

                              LUKE
               Luke, what's wrong?

     Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.

                              LUKE
               Leia... do you remember your mother? Your
               real mother?

                              LEIA
               Just a little bit. She died when I was very
               young.

                              LUKE
               What do you remember?

                              LEIA
               Just...images, really. Feelings.

                              LUKE
               Tell me.

                              LEIA
               (a little surprised at his insistence)
               She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.
               (looks up) Why are you asking me all this?

     He looks away.

                              LUKE
               I have no memory of my mother. I never knew
               her.

                              LEIA
               Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?

                              LUKE
               Vader is here...now, on this moon.

                              LEIA (alarmed)
               How do you know?

                              LUKE
               I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can
               feel when I'm near. That's why I have to go.
               (facing her) As long as I stay, I'm
               endangering the group and our mission here.
               (beat) I have to face him.

     Leia is distraught, confused.

                              LEIA
               Why?

     Luke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.

                              LUKE
               He's my father.

                              LEIA
               Your father?

                              LUKE
               There's more. It won't be easy for you to
               hear it, but you must. If I don't make it
               back, you're the only hope for the Alliance.

     Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.

                              LEIA
               Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power
               I--I don't understand and could never have.

                              LUKE
               You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too.
               In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The
               Force is strong in my family. My father has
               it...I have it...and...my sister has it.

     Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But
     she doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.

                              LUKE
               Yes. It's you Leia.

                              LEIA
               I know. Somehow...I've always known.

                              LUKE
               Then you know why I have to face him.

                              LEIA
               No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel
               your presence, then leave this place. I wish
               I could go with you.

                              LUKE
               No, you don't. You've always been strong.

                              LEIA
               But, why must you confront him?

                              LUKE
               Because...there is good in him. I've felt
               it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I
               can save him. I can turn him back to the good
               side. I have to try.

     They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and
     sister.

     Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves
     away. He disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the
     village. Leia, bathed in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes
     out of the Chief's hut and comes over to her.

     Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only now that she
     is crying.

                              HAN
               Hey, what's goin' on?

     Leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.

                              LEIA
               Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a
               little while.

                              HAN (angry)
               Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?

     She looks up at him, struggling to control herself.

                              LEIA
               I...I can't tell you.

                              HAN (loses his temper)
               Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?

                              LEIA
               I...

                              HAN
               Ahhh...

     He starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to
     her.

                              HAN
               I'm sorry.

                              LEIA
               Hold me.

     Han gathers her tightly in his protective embrace.

77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM                         77

     An Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands
     gracefully on the huge platform.

     Now, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness
     of the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military -
     looks particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.

78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK                     78

     Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform,
     into an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He
     walks toward another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a
     commander with Luke, in binders, at their center. The young Jedi
     gazes at Vader with complete calm.

                              COMMANDER
               This is a Rebel that surrendered to us.
               Although he denies it, I believe there may be
               more of them, and I request permission to
               conduct a further search of the area.

     The commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.

                              COMMANDER
               He was armed only with this.

     Vader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking
     the lightsaber from the commander's hand.

                              VADER
               Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your
               search and bring his companions to me.

                              COMMANDER
               Yes, my Lord.

     The officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing
     alone in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of
     the forest filter in upon them.

                              VADER
               The Emperor has been expecting you.

                              LUKE
               I know, father.

                              VADER
               So, you have accepted the truth.

                              LURE
               I've accepted the truth that you were once
               Anakin Skywalker, my father.

                              VADER (turning to face him)
               That name no longer has any meaning for me.

                              LUKE
               It is the name of your true self. You've only
               forgotten. I know there is good in you. The
               Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That
               is why you couldn't destroy me. That's why
               you won't bring me to your Emperor now.

     Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black-
     gloved hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.

                              VADER (indicating lightsaber)
               I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.

     Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming,
     brilliant blade.

                              VADER
               Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are
               powerful, as the Emperor has foreseen.

     They stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.

                              LUKE
               Come with me.

                              VADER
               Obi-Wan once thought as you do.

     Luke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.

                              VADER
               You don't know the power of the dark side. I
               must obey my master.

                              LUKE
               I will not turn...and you'll be forced to
               kill me.

                              VADER
               If that is your destiny.

                              LUKE
               Search your feelings, father. You can't do
               this. I feel the conflict within you. Let go
               of your hate.

                              VADER
               It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will
               show you the true nature of the Force. He is
               your master now.

     Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand
     staring at one another for a long moment.

                              LUKE
               Then my father is truly dead.

79   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING SHIELD GENERATOR                 79

     Han, Leia, Chewbacca, the droids, Wicket, and another Ewok scout,
     PAPLOO, hide on a ridge overlooking the massive Imperial shield
     generator. At the base of the generator is an Imperial landing
     platform. Leia studies the installation.

                              LEIA
               The main entrance to the control bunker's on
               the far side of that landing platform. This
               isn't gonna be easy.

                              HAN
               Hey, don't worry. Chewie and me got into a
               lot of places more heavily guarded than this.

     Wicket and Paploo are chattering away in Ewok language. They
     speak to Threepio.

                              LEIA
               What's he saying?

                              THREEPIO
               He says there's a secret entrance on the
               other side of the ridge.

80   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET                                        80

     The vast fleet hangs in space near a blue planet. A giant Rebel
     Star Cruiser is up at the front, but now the Millennium Flacon
     roars up to a spot ahead of it, tiny in comparison.

81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                                81

     Lando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes
     some getting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's
     cockpit. Lando speaks into his comlink.

                              LANDO
               Admiral, we're in position. All fighters
               accounted for.

                              ACKBAR (VO)
               Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume
               attack coordinates.

     Lando turns to his weird copilot.

                              LANDO
               Don't worry, my friends are down there.
               They'll have that shield down on time...(to
               himself) or this'll be the shortest offensive
               of all time.

     The copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment.

                              ACKBAR (VO)
               All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on
               my mark.

                              LANDO
               All right. Stand by.

     He pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak.

82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET                                        82

     We are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon,
     then Ackbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge
     fleet ROARS INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears.

83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER                   83

     Han, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket
     and Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire
     group is spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the
     BUNKER that leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their
     speeder bikes parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance.
     Chewie growls an observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in
     Ewok language.

                              HAN
               Back door, huh? Good idea.

     Wicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.

                              HAN (cont)
               It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too
               much trouble.

                              LEIA
               Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm.

                              HAN (with self-confident grin)
               Then we'll do it real quiet-like.

     Threepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The
     Ewoks chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up
     and scampers into the underbrush.

     Threepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short
     reply.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!

                              LEIA
               Quiet.

                              THREEPIO
               I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and
               done something rather rash.

                              LEIA
               Oh, no.

84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE                                          84

     Paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial
     scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body
     onto one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping
     switches at random. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a
     tremendous ROAR. Paploo grins and continues flipping switches.
     The scouts leap up in surprise.

85   EXT RIDGE                                                      85

     Han, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks.

                              HAN (sighs)
               There goes our surprise attack.

86   EXT BUNKER                                                     86

     The Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms
     into motion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the
     forest.

                              SCOUT
               Look! Over there! Stop him!

     Three of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed
     away in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the
     door.

     Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange delighted looks.

                              HAN
               Not bad for a little furball. There's only
               one left. You stay here. We'll take care of
               this.

     Han and the Wookiee nod at each other and slip down toward the
     bunker. Threepio moves to stand next to Wicket and Artoo.

                              THREEPIO
               I have decided that we shall stay here.

     Paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's
     scary, but he loves it. When the Imperial scouts pull within
     sight behind him and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's
     had enough. As he rounds a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs
     a vine and swings up into the trees. A moment later, the scouts
     tear under him in pursuit of the still-flying, unoccupied bike.

89   EXT BUNKER                                                     89

     Han sneaks up behind the remaining Imperial scout, taps him on
     the shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into
     the arms of the waiting Rebel strike team. Han returns to the
     front, and taps out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel.
     Everyone stands out of sight, police-style, as the door opens.
     Han and Leia peek inside. No sign of life. The group enters the
     bunker silently, leaving one lookout behind.

90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM                         90

     The elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They
     walk across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and
     son side by side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to
     his Master.

                              EMPEROR
               Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been
               expecting you.

     Luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks
     down at Luke's binders.

                              EMPEROR
               You no longer need those.

     The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's
     binders fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at
     his own hands, free now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck.
     He does nothing.

                              EMPEROR
               Guards, leave us.

     The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.

                              EMPEROR (to Luke)
               I'm looking forward to completing your
               training. In time you will call me Master.

                              LUKE
               You're gravely mistaken. You won't convert me
               as you did my father.

     The Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to
     Luke. The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time,
     Luke can perceive the evil visage within the hood.

                              EMPEROR
               Oh, no, my young Jedi. You will find that it
               is you who are mistaken...about a great
               many things.

                              VADER
               His lightsaber.

     Vader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's
     lightsaber. The Emperor takes it.

                              EMPEROR
               Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your
               father's. By now you must know your father
               can never be turned from the dark side. So
               will it be with you.

                              LUKE
               You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you
               with me.

     The Emperor laughs.

                              EMPEROR
               Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of
               your Rebel fleet.

     Luke looks up sharply.

                              EMPEROR
               Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from
               your friends here.

     Vader looks at Luke.

                              LUKE
               Your overconfidence is your weakness.

                              EMPEROR
               Your faith in your friends is yours.

                              VADER
               It is pointless to resist, my son.

     The Emperor turns to face Luke.

                              EMPEROR (angry)
               Everything that has transpired has done so
               according to my design. (indicates Endor)
               Your friends up there on the Sanctuary
               Moon...

     Luke reacts. The Emperor notes it.

                              EMPEROR (cont)
               ...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel
               fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to
               know the location of the shield generator. It
               is quite safe from your pitiful little band.
               An entire legion of my best troops awaits
               them.

     Luke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the
     sword in the Emperor's hand.

                              EMPEROR
               Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be
               quite operational when your friends arrive.

91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM                                 91

     Han, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door
     and enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel
     prisoner.

                              HAN
               All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly!
               Quickly, Chewie.

     The Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their
     panels. Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel.

                              LEIA
               Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any
               moment.

                              HAN
               Charges!  Come on, come on!

     Outside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more
     controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards
     at the door.

                              THREEPIO (to Wicket)
               Oh, my! They'll be captured!

     Wicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam
     into the forest.

                              THREEPIO
               Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with
               me.

     Inside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an
     Imperial commander enters.

                              COMMANDER
               Freeze! You Rebel scum.

     Han and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on
     them and their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops
     surround them. Even more pour into the room, roughly disarming
     the Rebel contingent. Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks.
     They're helpless.

92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET                     92

     The Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as
     the Rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The
     Millennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as
     the space armada bears down on its target.

     Lando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the
     radio.

               All wings report in.

94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                                94

     From the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar
     watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen.

                              ACKBAR
               May the Force be with us.

95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                                95

     Lando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points
     to the control panel and talks to Lando.

                              LANDO
               We've got to be able to get some kind of a
               reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how
               could they be jamming us if they don't know
               if we're coming.

     Lando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star
     as the implications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a
     switch on his comlink.

                              LANDO
               Break off the attack! The shield is still up.

                              RED LEADER (VO)
               I get no reading. Are you sure?

                              LANDO
               Pull up! All craft pull up!

     The Falcon turns hard to the left. Out the window the stars and
     the Death Star move off right.

96   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR SHIELD                                  96

     The Falcon and the fighters of Red Squad veer off desperately to
     avoid the unseen wall.

97   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                                97

     Alarms are screaming and lights flashing as the huge ship changes
     course abruptly. Other ships in the fleet shoot by outside as the
     armada tries to halt its forward momentum.

                              ACKBAR
               Take evasive action! Green Group, stick close
               to holding sector MV-7.

     A Mon Calamari controller turns away from his screen and calls
     out to Ackbar, quite excited. The Admiral rushes over to the
     controller.

                              CONTROLLER
               Admiral, we have enemy ships in sector 47.

     On the screen can be seen the moon, Death Star, and the massive
     Imperial fleet. Ackbar moves to the comlink.

                              ACKBAR
               It's a trap!

                              LANDO (over comlink)
               Fighters coming in.

     There is much excitement on the bridge as the attack begins.

     The Millennium Falcon and several squads of Rebel fighters head
     into an armada of TIE fighters. The sky explodes as a fierce
     dogfight ensues in and around the giant Rebel cruisers.

                              REBEL PILOT
               There's too many of them!

                              LANDO
               Accelerate to attack speed! Draw their fire
               away from the cruisers.

                              WEDGE
               Copy, Gold Leader.

     The battle continues around the giant cruisers.

98   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM                         98

     Through the round window behind the Emperor's throne can be seen
     the distant flashes of the space battle in progress.

                              EMPEROR
               Come, boy. See for yourself.

     The Emperor is sitting in his throne, with Vader standing at his
     side. Luke moves to look through a small section of the window.

                              EMPEROR
               From here you will witness the final
               destruction of the Alliance, and the end of
               your insignificant Rebellion.

     Luke is in torment. He glances at his lightsaber sitting on the
     armrest of the throne. The Emperor watches him and smiles,
     touches the lightsaber.

                              EMPEROR
               You want this, don't you? The hate is
               swelling in you now. Take your Jedi weapon.
               Use it. I am unarmed. Strike me down with it.
               Give in to your anger. With each passing
               moment, you make yourself more my servant.

     Vader watches Luke in his agony.

                              LUKE
               No!

                              EMPEROR
               It is unavoidable. It is your destiny. You,
               like your father, are now mine!

99   EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER                                  99

     Han, Leia, Chewie, and the rest of the strike team are led out of
     the bunker by their captors. The surrounding area, deserted
     before, is now crowded with two-legged Imperial walkers and
     hundreds of Imperial troops. The situation looks hopeless.

                              STORMTROOPER
               All right, move it! I said move it! Go on!

     From the undergrowth beyond the clearing comes a wild series of
     beeps and whistles. And --

                              THREEPIO
               Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking
               for me?

                              BUNKER COMMANDER
               Bring those two down here!

                              STORMTROOPER
               Let's go!

     Artoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six
     Imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two
     droids duck out of sight behind the tree.

                              THREEPIO
               Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you
               sure this was a good idea?

                              STORMTROOPER
               Freeze! Don't move!

                              THREEPIO
               We surrender.

     The stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids
     waiting quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do
     that, however, a band of Ewoks drops down from above and
     overpowers them.

                              THREEPIO
               Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo.

     In a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds
     the EWOK ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks
     throw their fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled
     stormtroopers and their awesome two-legged walkers.

     Biker scouts dart about blasting Ewoks, only to be crushed by a
     volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the trees above.

     In the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive
     for the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them.
     Han goes to the bunker door control panel.

                              LEIA
               The code's changed. We need Artoo!

                              HAN
               Here's the terminal.

                              LEIA (into comlink)
               Artoo, where are you? We need you at the
               bunker right away.

     Artoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle rages
     around them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a
     series of whistles and shoots off across the battlefield.
     Threepio, panicked, runs after him.

                              THREEPIO
               Going? What do you mean, you're going. But--
               but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh,
               this is no time for heroics. Come back!

     Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away
     at the little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.

     A group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position.
     They fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The
     walker turns and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both
     guns. The Ewoks abandon their weapons and flee in all directions.
     Just as the walker moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop
     vines restraining two huge logs that swing down and smash the
     walker's head flat.

     A line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a
     walker's foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are
     dragged behind.

     Two speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the
     scouts round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vine
     tied between two trees.

               Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above!

                              WEDGE
               Red Three, Red Two, pull in!

                              RED TWO
               Got it!

                              RED THREE
               Three of them coming in, twenty degrees!

                              WEDGE

               Cut to the left! I'll take the leader!
               They're heading for the medical frigate.

     Lando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew
     fires at the TIEs from the belly guns.

                              NAVIGATOR
               Pressure's steady.

     The copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation.

                              LANDO
               Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder
               what those Star Destroyers are waiting for.

102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET                                    102

     The giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance
     from the battle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in
     the middle of the fleet.

103  INT SUPER STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE                             103

     Admiral Piett and two fleet commanders watch the battle at the
     huge window of the Super Star Destroyer bridge.

                              COMMANDER
               We're in attack position now, sir.

                              PIETT
               Hold here.

                              COMMANDER
               We're not going to attack?

                              PIETT
               I have my orders from the Emperor himself. He
               has something special planned for them. We
               only need to keep them from escaping.

104  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM                             104

     The Emperor, Vader, and a horrified Luke watch the aerial battle
     fireworks out the window and on the viewscreens. Another Rebel
     ship explodes against the protective shield.

                              EMPEROR
               As you can see, my young apprentice, your
               friends have failed. Now witness the
               firepower of this fully armed and operational
               battle station. (into comlink) Fire at will,
               Commander.

     Luke, in shock, looks out across the surface of the Death Star to
     the Rebel fleet beyond.

105  INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM                                 105

     Controllers pull back on several switches. Commander Jerjerrod
     stands over them.

                              JERJERROD
               Fire!

106  INT DEATH STAR - BLAST CHAMBER                                106

     A button is pressed, which switches on a panel of lights.

     A hooded Imperial soldier reaches overhead and pulls a lever. A
     huge beam of light emanates from a long shaft. Two stormtroopers
     stand to one side at a control panel.

107  EXT DEATH STAR                                                107

     The giant laser dish on the completed half of the Death Star
     begins to glow; Then a powerful beams shoots out toward the
     aerial battle.

108  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE                                        108

     The air is thick with giant ships. In among them, Rebel X-wings
     dogfight with Imperial TIE fighters. Now an enormous Rebel
     cruiser is hit by the Death Star beam and is blown to dust.

     The Millennium Falcon roars over CAMERA, followed closely by
     several TIE fighters.

109  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                               109

     The ship is buffeted by the tremendous explosion of the Rebel
     cruiser. Lando and his copilot are stunned by the sight of the
     Death Star firepower.

                              LANDO
               That blast came from the Death Star! That
               thing's operational! (into comlink) Home One,
               this is Gold Leader.

110  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                               110

     Ackbar stands amid the confusion on the wide bridge and speaks
     into the comlink.

                              ACKBAR
               We saw it. All craft prepare to retreat.

                              LANDO
               You won't get another chance at this,
               Admiral.

                              ACKBAR
               We have no choice, General Calrissian. Our
               cruisers can't repel firepower of that
               magnitude.

                              LANDO
               Han will have that shield down. We've got to
               give him more time.

111  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER                                 111

     Artoo and Threepio make it to the door, as Han and Leia provide
     cover fire.

                              THREEPIO
               We're coming!

                              HAN
               Come on! Come on!

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, Artoo, hurry!

     The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer
     arm. A large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over
     heels, finally landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's
     head is spinning and smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud
     SPROOING and Han and Leia turn around to see Artoo with all his
     compartment doors open, and all of his appendages sticking out;
     water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in his body. Han rushes
     to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded companion.

                              THREEPIO
               My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so
               brave?

                              HAN
               Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing.

                              LEIA
               I'll cover you.

     Ewoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the
     stormtroopers, dive-bombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit
     in the wing with laser fire and crashes.  A walker lumbers
     forward, shooting laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all
     directions.  Two Ewoks are struck down by laser blasts.  One
     tries to awaken his friend, then realizes that he is dead.

112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR                                        112

     The Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the
     Death Star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging
     Imperial Star Destroyers.

113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT                               113

     Lando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of
     floating giants. He's been yelling into the comlink.

                              LANDO (desperately)
               Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can
               and engage those Star Destroyers at point-
               blank range.

                              ACKBAR
               At that close range, we won't last long
               against those Star Destroyers.

                              LANDO
               We'll last longer then we will against that
               Death Star...and we might just take a few of
               them with us.

     The Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star
     Destroyers and begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny
     fighters race across the giant surfaces, against a backdrop of
     laser fire.

     The control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack.

                              REBEL PILOT
               She's gonna blow!

                              Y-WING PILOT
               I'm hit!

     The damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and
     crashes into the control tower, exploding.

114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM                             114

     Out of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is
     being decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But
     in here there is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.

                              EMPEROR
               Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the
               Endor moon will not survive. There is no
               escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance
               will die...as will your friends.

     Luke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.

                              EMPEROR
               Good. I can feel your anger. I am
               defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me
               down with all your hatred, and your journey
               towards the dark side will be complete.

     Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He
     ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's
     lightsaber flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can
     reach the Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to
     fight his father.

115  EXT FOREST                                                    115

     The battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with
     sophisticated weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak
     up behind the Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with
     large clubs.

     A walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it
     goes. An Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut
     loose. The logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to
     slip and slide until it finally topples over with a great crash.

     A scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The
     other end of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings
     around in ever-tightening circles until it runs out of rope and
     crashes into the trees with a huge explosion.

     Chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two
     Ewoks cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the
     lurching machine, then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks
     peeks through the window.

                              WALKER PILOT #1
               Look!

                              PILOT #2
               Get him off of there!

     The walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is
     yanked out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two
     Ewoks jump into the cockpit and knock the second pilot
     unconscious. The Ewoks are thrown violently as the mighty machine
     careens out of control. Outside, Chewie is almost knocked
     overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch with a series of
     angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to listen to
     the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.

     Chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts
     at unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial
     walkers. The Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps
     turn the tide of the battle in their favor.

116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER                                 116

     Han works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he
     attempts to hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting
     away at some stormtroopers.

                              HAN
               I think I got it. I got it!

     The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD
     WHOOSH, a second blast door crashes down in front of the first.

     Han frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges
     shots with stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out
     in pain, her shoulder hit by a laser blast.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?

                              HAN
               Let's see.

                              LEIA
               It's not bad.

                              STORMTROOPER (OS)
               Freeze!

     They freeze.

                              THREEPIO
               Oh, dear.

                              STORMTROOPER
               Don't move!

     Leia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the
     two stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock;
     the moment seems suspended in time.

                              HAN
               I love you.

     Another shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han.

                              LEIA
               I know.

                              STORMTROOPER
               Hands up! Stand up!

     Han stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand.
     She disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back
     toward Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand
     before him, its deadly weapons aimed right at him.

                              HAN (to Leia)
               Stay back.

     The hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head
     out and barks triumphantly.

                              HAN
               Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No,
               wait....  I got an idea.

117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM                             117

     Luke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers
     even more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi
     has grown stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts
     to him. Vader is forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked
     down the stairs. Luke stands at the top of the stairs, ready to
     attack.

                              EMPEROR (laughing)
               Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let
               the hate flow through you.

     Luke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader,
     and realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off
     his lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.

                              VADER
               Obi-Wan has taught you well.

                              LUKE
               I will not fight you, father.

     Vader walks back up the stairs to Luke.

                              VADER
               You are unwise to lower your defenses.

     Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi
     leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk
     overhead. Vader stands below him.

                              LUKE
               Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the
               good in you...the conflict.

                              VADER
               There is no conflict.

                              LUKE
               You couldn't bring yourself to kill me
               before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me
               now.

                              VADER
               You underestimate the power of the dark side.
               If you will not fight, then you will meet
               your destiny.

     Vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports
     holding the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles
     to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under
     the Emperor's platform. Vader moves to find him.

                              EMPEROR (laughs)
               Good.  Good.

118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE                                        118

     The two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at
     each other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star
     Destroyer explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half
     alive with a series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser
     manages to move in next to a second Star Destroyer before it
     explodes completely, taking the Imperial Star Destroyer with it.
     The Falcon and several fighters attack one of the larger Imperial
     ships.

119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM                                     119

     Controllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of
     an Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of
     static and interference.

                              HAN/PILOT (VO)
               It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been
               routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We
               need reinforcements to continue the pursuit.

     The controllers cheer.

                              CONTROL ROOM COMMANDER
               Send three squads to help. Open the back
               door.

                              SECOND COMMANDER
               Yes, sir.

120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER                                 120

     As the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out,
     they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their
     weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on
     the roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns
     as Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges.

121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM                                     121

     Han, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and
     plant explosive charges on the control panels and rush out.

                              HAN
               Throw me another charge.

122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM                             122

     Vader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the
     throne, searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber
     held ready.

                              VADER
               You cannot hide forever, Luke.

                              LUKE
               I will not fight you.

                              VADER
               Give yourself to the dark side. It is the
               only way you can save your friends. Yes, your
               thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them
               are strong. Especially for...

     Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in
     anguish.

                              VADER
               Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your
               feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan
               was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure
               is complete. If you will not turn to the dark
               side, then perhaps she will.

                              LUKE
               Never-r-r!

     Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at his
     father with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke
     and Vader fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader
     to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a
     vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his
     father further toward defeat.

     The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword
     to block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off
     at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the
     mechanical stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the
     edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke
     moves over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark
     Lord's throat. The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased
     agitation.

                              EMPEROR
               Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now,
               fulfill your destiny and take your father's
               place at my side!

     Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own
     mechanical, black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is
     becoming like his father. He makes the decision for which he
     has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and hurls
     his lightsaber away.

                              LUKE
               Never! I'll never turn to the dark side.
               You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi,
               like my father before me.

     The Emperor's glee turns to rage.

                              EMPEROR
               So be it...Jedi.

123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER                                 123

     Han and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race
     across the clearing.

                              HAN
               Move! Move!

     A shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by
     a spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish
     explodes along with the bunker.

124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                               124

     Ackbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio.

                              ACKBAR
               The shield is down! Commence attack on the
               Death Star's main reactor.

                              LANDO
               We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all
               fighters follow me. (laughs) Told you they'd
               do it!

     The Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads
     toward the unfinished superstructure of the Death Star.

125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM                             125

     Luke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of the
     stairs. The Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his
     arms toward Luke.

                              EMPEROR
               If you will not be turned, you will be
               destroyed.

     Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the
     Emperor's hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi
     tries to use the Force to deflect them. At first he is half
     successful, but after a moment the bolts of energy are coming
     with such speed and power the young Jedi shrinks before them, his
     knees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to his feet, and
     moves to stand at his master's side.

                              EMPEROR
               Young fool...only now, at the end, do you
               understand.

     Luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the
     Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling
     into the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.

                              EMPEROR
               Your feeble skills are no match for the power
               of the dark side. You have paid the price for
               your lack of vision.

     Luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up
     toward where Vader stands watching.

                              LUKE (groans)
               Father, please. Help me.

     Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the
     Emperor, then back to Luke on the floor.

                              EMPEROR
               Now, young Skywalker...you will die.

     Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of
     bolts from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity,
     the sound screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in
     pain.

     Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the
     robed figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely
     weakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-
     shooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white
     lightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load
     as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black
     cape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to
     the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With
     one final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls
     the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.

     The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it
     falls into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the
     shaft, it explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.
     Vader's cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers, and
     collapses toward the bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's
     side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety.
     Both the young Jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move.

126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR               126

     Rebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death
     Star to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the super-
     structure of the giant battle station, followed by many TIE
     fighters.

                              WEDGE
               I'm going in.

                              LANDO
               Here goes nothing.

     Three X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft,
     followed by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters
     who continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the
     pilot's faces as they race through the dark shaft.

                              LANDO
               Now lock onto the strongest power source. It
               should be the power generator.

                              WEDGE
               Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of
               space real fast.

     The fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still
     pursued by the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from
     behind and explodes.

                              LANDO
               Split up and head back to the surface. See if
               you can get a few of those TIE fighters to
               follow you.

                              PILOT
               Copy, Gold Leader.

     The Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while
     Lando and Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and
     the Falcon scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters
     continue to blast away at them.

                              LANDO
               That was too close.

     Nien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet
     rages on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star
     Destroyer.

127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                               127

               We've got to give those fighters more time.
               Concentrate all fire on that Super Star
               Destroyer.

     X-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship.

     Admiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to
     the battle. They look concerned.

                              CONTROLLER
               Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield.

                              PIETT
               Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want
               anything to get through.

     The commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel
     fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge.

                              PIETT
               Intensify forward firepower!

                              COMMANDER
               It's too late!

     The Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer,
     causing a huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control,
     crashes into the Death Star, and explodes.

129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE                               129

     There is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all
     sides. They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up.

130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY                             130

     Chaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions
     as the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over,
     unloading a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions,
     confused and desperate to escape.

     In the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous
     deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial
     shuttle. Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions
     grow louder as Vader draws him closer.

                              VADER (a whisper)
               Luke, help me take this mask off.

               But you'll die.

                              VADER
               Nothing can stop that now. Just for once...
               let me look on you with my own eyes.

     Slowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face.
     There beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus.
     But the dying man smiles at the sight before him.

                              ANAKIN (very weak)
               Now...go, my son. Leave me.

                              LUKE
               No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you
               here. I've got to save you.

                              ANAKIN
               You already have, Luke. You were right about
               me. Tell your sister...you were right.

                              LUKE
               Father... I won't leave you.

     Darth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies.

     A huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and,
     half carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles
     toward a shuttle.

     The Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the
     immense superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel
     Star Cruisers outside continually bombard the huge station. And
     each direct hit is answered by resonating, chain-reaction
     explosions within the station itself.

     Lando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the
     dashing Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main
     reactor shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of
     the Falcon.

                              WEDGE
               There it is!

                              LANDO
               All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator
               on the north tower.

                              WEDGE
               Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out.

     The X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires
     several proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series
     of small explosions.

     The Falcon heads for the main reactor, and when it is dangerously
     close, Lando fires the missiles, which shoot out of the Falcon
     with a powerful roar, and hit directly at the center of the main
     reactor.

     He maneuvers the Falcon out of the winding superstructure just
     ahead of the continuing chain of explosions.

     Ackbar and other Mon Calamari lean on the railing of the bridge,
     watching the large screen showing the Death Star in the main
     briefing room.

     An Imperial shuttle, with Luke alone in the cockpit, rockets out
     of the main docking bay as that entire section of the Death Star
     is blown away. But as Luke pilots toward the safety of the
     Sanctuary moon, his thoughts - enhanced by the Force - turn to
     his friends aboard the Millennium Falcon.

     The Falcon flies at top speed, with a single X-wing as escort,
     over the endless surface of the Death Star. A series of
     explosions within the superstructure follow, then swiftly
     overtake the small craft as it races for an exit.

               Wedge, I don't think we're going to make it.

                              WEDGE (VO)
               You'll make it. Just follow me Gold Leader.

                              LANDO (to himself)
               I promised to return his ship without a

               forgives me.

     An X-wing, piloted by Wedge Antilles, races out of the exploding
     superstructure and whizzes toward the Sanctuary Moon. But the
     Millennium Falcon is not fast enough as it explodes with the
     Death Star in a supernova of glory.

     Han and Leia, Chewie, the droids, the Rebel troops, and the Ewoks
     all look to the sky as the Death Star reveals itself in a final
     flash of self-destruction. All except Han cheer, as the thirty-
     year-old starship pilot feels a deep personal loss.

                              HAN (whispering to himself)

               They did it!

     Han looks down from the sky to Leia, a look of sorrow and regret
     on his face. He knows he will never see the Falcon and Lando
     again. His thoughts turn to Leia, as she continues to look at the
     sky, watching for Luke.

     Luke sets a torch to the logs stacked under a funeral pyre where
     his father's body lies, again dressed in black mask and helmet.
     He stands, watching sadly, as the flames leap higher to consume
     Darth Vader -- Anakin Skywalker.

     In the sky above, fireworks explode and Rebel fighters zoom above
     the forest.

     and Ewoks rejoice in the warm glow of firelight, drums beating,
     singing, dancing, and laughing in the communal language of
     victory and liberation.

     Lando runs in and is enthusiastically hugged by Han and Chewie.
     Then, finally, Luke arrives and the friends rush to greet and
     embrace him. They stand close, this hardy group, taking comfort
     in each other's touch, together to the end.

     Rebels and Ewoks join together in dancing and celebration. The
     original group of adventurers watch from the sidelines. Only Luke
     seems distracted, alone in their midsts, his thoughts elsewhere.

     He looks off to the side and sees three shimmering, smiling
     figures at the edge of the shadows: Ben Kenobi, Yoda, and Anakin
     Skywalker.

                                    THE FORCE AWAKENS



           Luke Skywalker has vanished. In his absence,
           the sinister FIRST ORDER has risen from the
           ashes of the Empire and will not rest until
           Skywalker, the last Jedi, has been destroyed.

           With the support of the REPUBLIC, General
           Leia Organa leads a brave RESISTANCE. She is
           desperate to find her brother Luke and gain
           his help in restoring peace and justice to
           the galaxy.

           Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret
           mission to Jakku, where an old ally has
           discovered a clue to Luke's whereabouts....


          PAN across the star field to a bright moon. A RUMBLING is
          FELT. A VAST STAR DESTROYER -- unlike any we have seen --
          HURTLES PAST US, of seemingly endless length, eclipsing the
          moon. After a long beat, FOUR TRANSPORT SHIPS fly from a
          hangar. We HOLD ON THEM NOW, as they fly off toward a distant
          planet. Jakku. MUSIC BUILDS AND WE...

          CUT TO BLACK.

          A GROWING ROAR of MEAN ENGINES -- gnarled RADIO CALLS, the
          SHUDDERING of a ship's hull. Then FLASHES OF LIGHT: for an
          instant we see a STORMTROOPER -- then BLACKNESS. Then ANOTHER
          STORMTROOPER, then it's gone.

          The FLICKERING CONTINUES until the LIGHTS ARE CONSTANT. We

                         ARE IN:

          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

          TWENTY STORMTROOPERS. Holding on at attention, moving to
          the ship's rhythm, in the tense moments before a raid. A
          FILTERED COMMAND and they LOCK AND LOAD their heavy blaster
          rifles. The BRUTAL NOISE is replaced by SUDDEN, SHOCKING

                         QUIET:

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          WIDE SHOT of a small, peaceful village. Distant sounds of
          native animals. A single wind chime.
          Suddenly a DROID RISES INTO FRAME, CLOSE: ROUND and SKITTERY,
          orange and white, this is BB-8.
          Focuses on something past camera. He BEEPS -- FAST, MORSE
          CODE-LIKE SOUNDS, clearly worried. Moves EVEN CLOSER TO
          CAMERA -- is MORE worried -- BEEPS more -- then TURNS AND

          ROLLS OFF FAST --

          INT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

          CLOSE ON A HAND: a small LEATHER SACK is placed in the palm.
          The hand closes. Another OLDER HAND covers it.
          In a primitive HUT, an old explorer, LOR SAN TEKKA, (rugged,
          kind) has handed the mysterious sack to POE DAMERON (32, in
          a pilot's jacket). Poe has charisma, a natural spark:

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           This will begin to make things right.
           I've traveled too far, and seen too
           much, to ignore the despair in the
           galaxy. Without the Jedi, there can
           be no balance in the Force.

                          POE
           Well, because of you now we have a
           chance. The General's been after
           this for a long time.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           "The General." To me, she's royalty.
           Well, she certainly is that.

                          POE
          BB-8 ENTERS FRANTIC, BEEPS. Concerned, Poe turns to Lor San
          Tekka.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           We've got company.

          EXT. LARGE HUT - NIGHT

          The men exit fast. Poe moves TO CAMERA, raises QUADNOCULARS.
          POE'S POV: LIGHTS on the horizon -- approaching ENEMY SHIPS.
          POE lowers the quadnocs -- PUSH IN ON HIS UNNERVED EYES. A

          GROWING, FRIGHTENING THUNDER.

                          POE
           You have to hide.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           You have to leave. Go!
          Poe turns to him. Conflicted. Finally nods, hurries off.
          BB-8 follows.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          TRACK FAST with Poe as he and BB-8 hurry through the village,
          various ARMED VILLAGERS taking position, prepared to defend.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          A ROAR of WIND and DUST: the TRANSPORTS LAND. Stormtroopers
          come out FIRING BLASTERS -- the VILLAGERS FIRE BACK -- many
          are HIT!

          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Poe runs to an X-WING fighter, parked at a distance from the
          village, hidden behind a ROCK OUTCROPPING.

                          POE
           Come on, BB-8! Hurry!
          Poe sends BB-8 into the droid socket / co-pilot seat -- he
          moves to the cockpit -- the CONTROLS COME TO LIFE. As the
          CANOPY CLOSES, Poe shoots a quick look back: the ENEMY ARRIVES

          IN THE DISTANCE.
          Poe urgently works the controls -- BB-8 BEEPS.
          The X-WING LANDING LIGHTS COME ON, ENGINES WHINE TO LIFE!
          But just then:
          Poe's ship is suddenly HIT BY BLASTERFIRE! Poe turns to
          look: two STORMTROOPERS CHARGE HIS WAY, FIRING!

                          POE (CONT'D)
           I see 'em!
          BB-8 BEEPS nervously as Poe GRABS HIS CONTROLS and FIRES AT
          THEM, using the X-wing's drop-down antipersonnel blaster!
          The two Troopers are BLOWN AWAY in the large BLAST HITS!
          Poe tries to start the ship now, but the ENGINES SPUTTER.
          Concerned, he opens his canopy, jumps down, moves to the
          back of his ship: BAD DAMAGE ON THE REAR ENGINE PANEL.
          They're in trouble.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Lor San Tekka moves sadly through the village as STORMTROOPERS
          wielding FLAME THROWERS destroy structures. Surrendering
          Villagers are ROUNDED UP. Penned ANIMALS panic.

          EXT. RISE ADJACENT TO THE VILLAGE - NIGHT

          Back at the X-wing, Poe kneels beneath his ship, pulls from
          the leather sack a SMALL, OLD ARTIFACT which he inserts into
          BB-8 -- the droid's MULTI-READER ENVELOPS it.

                          POE
           You take this. It's safer with you
           than it is with me. You get as far
           away from here as you can. Do you
           hear me?
           (BB-8 BEEPS, hesitates)
           I'll come back for you! It will be
           alright.

                         

                         
          BB-8 watches Poe run off. BEEP-WHINES nervously, then turns
          and heads off. Turns back once to look at Poe, then ROLLS
          AWAY. Poe uses his blaster rifle to fire at incoming troopers
          from cover.

          EXT. JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          The Troopers and villagers in battle -- as one Trooper is
          HIT and goes down. Another -- OUR TROOPER -- KNEELS to help.
          The hit trooper raises a torn, bloody glove -- his HUMAN
          HAND visible -- and MARKS OUR STORMTROOPER'S MASK WITH BLOOD
          just before he dies. Our Trooper, stands -- overwhelmed by
          the battle.

          AN IMPOSING SHUTTLE CRAFT -- VERTICAL WINGSPAN 90 FEET TALL --

          LANDS NEAR THE TRANSPORT VEHICLES.
          The shuttle craft door OPENS -- through the wind and smoke,
          KYLO REN exits the ship: a TALL, DARK FIGURE, he strides
          through the chaos toward San Tekka.
          A senior Trooper moves to our blood-marked Trooper, and orders

                         HIM:

                          SENIOR TROOPER
           Stay here.
          Our Trooper nods.
          Kylo Ren stops before the outraged Lor San Tekka, dwarfing
          him. Only now does it become apparent that Kylo Ren wears a
          DARK MASK, marked by battle. Inset metal lines reflect FIRE.

                          KYLO REN
           Look how old you've become.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           Something far worse has happened to
           you.
          Our blood-marked TROOPER is placed in line with other
          stormtroopers.

                          KYLO REN
           You know what I've come for.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

          CONTINUED: LOR SAN TEKKA
           I know where you come from. Before
           you called yourself Kylo Ren.

                          KYLO REN
           The map to Skywalker. We know you've
           found it, and now you're going to
           give it to the First Order.
          Adjacent to the village, Poe enters frame -- sees the Ren/San
          Tekka exchange continue.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           The First Order rose from the dark
           side... you did not.

                          KYLO REN
           I'll show you the dark side.

           LOR SAN TEKKA
           You may try, but you cannot deny the
           truth that is your family.
          Suddenly Kylo Ren raises his LIGHTSABER -- IGNITES IT --

          PERPENDICULAR SMALLER BLADES AT THE HILT, A UNIQUE BUZZ --

          YELLOW/RED ENERGY, SPITTING SPARKS AND SMOKE --

                          KYLO REN
           You're so right.
          And as he RIPS IT DOWN ACROSS SAN TEKKA!
          Poe, RUNNING, SEES THIS AND YELLS, AIMS HIS BLASTER AND FIRES
          AT KYLO REN! Instantly:
          Kylo Ren RAISES HIS HAND -- POE'S BLAST FREEZES -- THE BOLT

          OF ENERGY STRAINING AND VIBRATING IN MID AIR!
          Kylo Ren sees Poe, who suddenly CANNOT MOVE, but strains to.
          He is grabbed by Stormtroopers who drag him past the
          VIBRATING, FROZEN BLAST, to Kylo Ren.
          A Stormtrooper begins a brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves
          closer. Poe just glares. The Stormtrooper KICKS OUT Poe's
          legs -- he lands hard on his knees.
          Kylo Ren kneels to look at Poe.

                          POE
           So who talks first? You talk first?

                          KYLO REN
           The old man gave it to you.

                          POE

                          (INDICATES KYLO'S

                          MASK)
           It's just very hard to understand
           you with all the...

                         

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          KYLO REN

                          (TO TROOPERS)
           Search him.

                          POE
           ... Apparatus.
          The Troopers roughly pull Poe away. A Stormtrooper begins a
          brutal PAT DOWN. Kylo Ren moves closer.
          Poe just glares as the pat down ends.

                          STORMTROOPER #1
           Nothing, sir.

                          KYLO REN
           Put him on board.
          Kylo Ren regards the Stormtroopers with the rounded up
          Villagers, then turns to the CHROME-SKINNED, FEMALE BLACK-

          CAPED HEAD STORMTROOPER, CAPTAIN PHASMA.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           Sir, the villagers.

                          KYLO REN
           Kill them all.
          Phasma nods, steps forward:

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           On my command!
          The Troopers, including OURS, aim at the Villagers.

           CAPTAIN PHASMA (CONT'D)
           Fire!
          Poe is roughly PULLED into a transport ship, the ramp LIFTS.
          All around our Trooper BLASTERFIRE ERUPTS -- but we're WIDE
          ENOUGH to see he ISN'T FIRING. PUSH IN until the FIRING
          STOPS. All the Stormtroopers SPREAD OUT TO SEARCH -- except
          ours.
          Kylo Ren heads back toward his ship. But then he STOPS.
          Feels something. TURNS AND LOOKS AT OUR STORMTROOPER for a
          LONG MOMENT. Our Trooper can barely meet his gaze; knows
          he's doomed.
          Kylo Ren then heads off -- passes the FROZEN BLAST, which,
          after a beat, GOES FREE AND SLAMS INTO A NEARBY STRUCTURE,
          scaring the hell out of our Stormtrooper.

          EXT. EDGE OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          A Stormtrooper climbs down from the cockpit of Poe's X-wing,

                         BACKS AWAY:

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          STORMTROOPER #2
           Nothing here. Go ahead!
          Three other Stormtroopers FIRE LASER CANNONS at the X-wing --
          destroying the ship in a LARGE EXPLOSION.

          EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF JAKKU VILLAGE - NIGHT

          BB-8 rolls across the sand, looks back: the X-wing FIREBALL.
          BB-8, afraid, continues on his own in a mysterious, dark
          desert. We see a FORM -- an animal, its RED EYES LIFTING
          from the sand, watching the rolling droid, who just keeps
          going.
          In a WIDE SHOT, we HEAR HIM BEEPING to himself, lonely and
          frightened.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          With the SANDY PLANET OF JAKKU as backdrop, Troop Transports
          and Kylo Ren's Shuttle approach a massive STAR DESTROYER.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER HANGAR - NIGHT

          Poe, shackled, is ushered from the transport through the
          hangar. He is awed by the imposing space.

                          POE
           All right. All right!
          Our Stormtrooper passes, moves fast:

          INT. TROOP TRANSPORT VEHICLE - NIGHT

          Our Stormtrooper enters the dark, vehicle. He removes his
          helmet. His head comes up and we PUSH IN ON HIS FACE FOR
          THE FIRST TIME. This is FN-2187. He is 23, likable. But
          in this moment, terrified, desperate.
          After a beat, behind him, CAPTAIN PHASMA enters. FN-2187
          knows he's in trouble.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           FN-2187. Submit your blaster for
           inspection.

                          FN-2187
           Yes, Captain.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           And who gave you permission to remove
           that helmet?

                          FN-2187
           I'm sorry, Captain.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           Report to my division at once.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Phasma heads off. Shattered, FN-2187 replaces his helmet.

                          CUT TO:

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL CORRIDOR - DAY

          A metal sheet is pulled open to reveal the wrapped up face
          of A SCAVENGER, perhaps alien, in GOGGLES, FACE MASK and
          GLOVES. Backpack with a STAFF strapped to it. Uses TOOLS
          to remove various MECHANISMS from inside the wall. We are
          in an upside-down, canted CORRIDOR. The Scavenger finds a
          valuable piece, drops it in a SATCHEL.
          Swings the bag back and begins CLIMBING DOWN on a cable,
          between treacherous WALLS OF MACHINERY, headed to:

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - LARGER SPACE - LATER

          Alone and tiny in this massive, sideways wreck, the Scavenger
          descends, climbing down a two-hundred foot-long cable. LANDS
          HARD onto rusty metal.

          INT. JUNKED VESSEL - ENGINES - DAY

          The Scavenger carries the satchel and another large, found
          piece, over enormous pipes in the vast space, heads through
          the dust toward a distant SLIT OF SUNLIGHT.

          EXT. JUNKED VESSEL ENGINE - DAY

          The Scavenger arrives from the darkness and pulls off goggles
          and gear, revealing the grimy face of a beautiful, young
          WOMAN. This is REY, 19.
          She opens her canteen, shakes out the two final drops into
          her mouth. HITS THE SIDE of the canteen again and again for
          whatever she can get. CUT WIDE:
          Rey is rendered minuscule, standing at the bottom of an EPIC

          ENGINE OF A DECAYING, CRASHED STAR DESTROYER -- DISTANT SOUND
          of her canteen-hitting. She sets her things on a piece of
          sheet metal and sits next to it, sliding down the sand dune.
          She RIDES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN OF SAND. WE HOLD FOR A LONG
          TIME, looking down, as she recedes from us, toward the distant
          SALT FLATS below. Random SCATTERED DEBRIS. Her SPEEDER,
          tiny from here.
          Rey moves to her junker SPEEDER, jumps on, fires the sputtery
          engine and DRIVES OFF.

          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          Rey races along the desert floor: a GRAVEYARD OF CRASHED

          SPACESHIPS.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Rey's speeder PASSES us, heading for a dusty, desert town.
          Refueling, small trade, scavengers.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          CRASH! Rey's sack carrying her heavy FOUND OBJECTS hits the
          sand. Working like a tough seaman, Rey hauls the sack from
          her speeder toward the town.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - CLEANING TABLE - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S HANDS as she SCRUBS CLEAN her day's salvage.
          Rey glances up: she looks at an old woman, also cleaning
          some salvage.
          Rey watches her, gets lost in the simple moment. A small,
          passing alien UNDERLING barks something to her in another
          language. She returns to work.

          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Rey looks up to a SERVICE WINDOW: two feet above her, behind
          a protective screen, is her boss, UNKAR PLUTT (50, blobfish,
          unclean). He examines her pieces. Then he offers:

                          UNKAR
           What you've brought me today is
           worth... Hmmm... One quarter
           portion.
          Though disappointed, Rey barely shows it. She nods thanks.
          Unkar pushes through his transfer drawer a SEALED PACKET:
          DRIED GREEN MEAT in one section, BEIGE POWDER in another.
          She takes it.
          She swallows her resentment and heads off.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          The IMMENSE SETTING SUN against the FLAT TERRAIN. Rey's
          SPEEDER races, almost insignificant, across frame.

          INT. REY'S DWELLING - DAY

          She SCRATCHES MARKS into the rusty wall. Another MARK;
          another DAY. And there are THOUSANDS of marks.
          A SIZZLING SOUND over: A DRIED DESERT FLOWER in a rusty ENGINE
          PIECE. A rough, stuffed HANDMADE DOLL, made from what looks
          like orange Rebellion flight suit material and twine.
          Rey's lonely, ramshackle dwelling. Everything reclaimed.
          She cooks for one. Does everything for one. She opens the
          POWDER, moves to the makeshift WOK, where the GREEN MEAT
          SIZZLES. Pours the powder into milky WATER in a tin. Stirs
          it. It GROWS INTO A LOAF as she puts the meat on an old
          plate. Grabs the loaf.

          EXT. REY'S DWELLING - DUSK

          Rey sits, eats like a starving child. Every last drop.
          Licks the metal plate. Looks out at the horizon. A single
          silent ship heads off, a shimmering, thin contrail. She
          wipes her mouth. Picks up an old, broken REBELLION HELMET.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)
          CONTINUED: just 'cause.
          Puts it on,
          WIDE SHOT of Rey sitting, alone and isolated, on the leg of
          an ANCIENT, FALLEN AT-AT in which she lives.
          Then, a distant ELECTRONIC SQUEAL -- instantly she's up,
          helmet too big, she rips it off. Hears ANOTHER BEEPING
          SQUEAL. She hurries to her QUARTERSTAFF and runs off.
          Rey climbs a dune. RISE WITH HER, revealing BB-8, caught in
          a NET but fighting back, being held by a TEEDO (a small,
          brutish desert tyrant), who rides a LUGGABEAST. The teedo
          YELLS at BB-8, who BEEPS madly, struggling to free himself.
          Rey watches this injustice for a beat, finally YELLING OUT:

                          REY
           Tal'ama parqual!
          The Teedo and BB-8 STOP, GO SILENT, turn to her.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Parqual zatana!
          A half beat and the Teedo YELLS SOMETHING BACK, threatening.
          BB-8's head swivels to him, then back to Rey, like watching
          a tennis match.
          Rey angrily moves to them, pulling a knife from her pouch.
          Rey starts CUTTING BB-8 out of the netting. The Teedo freaks
          out, YELLING. Rey suddenly stands, turns to the Teedo and
          says, fiercely:

                          REY (CONT'D)

           NOMA.
          The Teedo barks a sort of "AHHHHH!" (As if to say, "GO TO
          HELL!"), Then heads off on his beast. This prompts BB-8 to
          start BEEP-YELLING at the departing bully, provocatively.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Shhhh.
          BB-8 quiets instantly. The two watch the Teedo head off.
          Finally, BB-8 BEEPS a question. She KNEELS to him.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           That's just Teedo. Wants you for
           parts. He has no respect for anyone.
           Your antenna's bent.
           (considers BB-8 for
           the first time,

                          STRAIGHTENS THE

                          ANTENNA)
           Where do you come from?

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           Classified. Really? Me too. Big
           secret.
           (points to horizon)
           Niima Outpost is that way, stay off
           Kelvin Ridge.

           Keep away from the Sinking Fields in
           the north, you'll drown in the sand.
           (stands, heads off)

                         
          BB-8 starts after her, BEEPS. She turns sharply, he stops.

                         

                         

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Don't follow me. Town is that way.
           (he BEEPS again)
           No!
          She heads off again. Finally he BEEPS to her -- something
          SWEET this time. That he is alone, scared, has no one else.
          This makes her stop. She turns and looks at him. Not liking
          him. But a gesture of her head says, reluctantly, "Come
          on." BB-8 quickly moves to her. They head off together.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           In the morning, you go.

                          (HE BEEPS)
           You're welcome.
          The two disappear behind a dune.

          EXT. STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          Three TIE fighters head to the massive ship high above Jakku.

          INT. STAR DESTROYER HOLDING CELL - DAY

          POE, shackled to a chair, BEATEN, wakes up.

                          KYLO REN
           I had no idea we had the best pilot
           in the Resistance on board.
           Comfortable?
          Through battered lips:

                          POE
           Not really.

                          KYLO REN

           to get out of you what you did with
           the map.

                          POE
           Might wanna rethink your technique.
          Kylo Ren says nothing, reaches out to him. Poe flinches in
          the chair as Kylo Ren reaches for his face, not touching
          him. Poe is soon in agony, remains in horrible silence --

                          KYLO REN

          Poe can't take it -- he BEGINS TO SCREAM and we CUT TO:

          INT. STAR DESTROYER CORRIDOR - DAY

          WHOOOSH! The cell door SLIDES UP. Kylo Ren exits, fierce,
          confronts GENERAL HUX (34, scary) who awaits him:

                          KYLO REN
           It's in a droid. A BB unit.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Well then. If it's on Jakku, we'll
           soon have it.

                          KYLO REN
           I leave that to you.

          BB-8 is dropped to the sand.

                          REY
           Don't give up. He still might show
           up. Whoever it is you're waiting
           for. Classified. I know all about
           waiting.
          BB-8 BEEPTALKS a question.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           For my family. They'll be back.
           One day. Come on.
          She tries to force a smile, but can't, really. She heads
          off. BB-8 BEEPS... then heads after her.

          INT. NIIMA TRADING STRUCTURE - DAY

          Rey stands with BB-8 in front of Unkar Plutt, at his window.
          He reviews her goods. He glances quickly at BB-8.

                          UNKAR
           These five pieces are worth... Let
           me see here... One half portion.

           I'll pay for him.
          BB-8 doesn't like this at all. Rey is awkward, but curious.

                          UNKAR (CONT'D)
           Sixty portions.
          CLOSE ON HER. Stunned. Literally hungry for this amount of
          food, her stomach practically rumbles.
          BB-8 sees her interest and BEEPS furiously, not liking this
          conversation at all.
          She looks at Unkar. Looks down at BB-8. Considers it all.
          Finally, she hears herself say:

                          REY
           Actually... the droid's not for sale.

                          (TO BB-8)
           Come on.
          Unkar furious. Rey, then BB-8, head out. Recovering, Unkar
          watches her go with dark eyes. He picks up a communicator:

                          UNKAR
           Follow the girl and get that droid.
          He SLAMS the service window door SHUT.

          FN-2187 and Poe (wincing, sore) drop into the back-to-back
          cockpit. FN-2187 pulls off his helmet as Poe removes his
          cuffs and jacket, fires up the ship with excitement.

                          POE
           I always wanted to fly one of these
           things. Can ya shoot?

           Okay, same principal! Use the toggle

          Poe pilots -- amazed, almost enjoying it.

           Woooahhh! This thing really moves.
           All right, we gotta take out as many

          The TIE Fighter ARCS BACK, DIVES THROUGH THE OPENING BETWEEN

           Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn!
           That all right?
          Even in the madness, Finn can't suppress his smile.

           Yes, sir. Bringing them online --

           General Hux. Is it the Resistance
           pilot?
          Hux turns: Kylo Ren enters fast, looms large, angry.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Yes, and he had help.

                          (VEXED)
           From one of our own.
          PUSH IN ON REN as Hux says:

           2187.
          Hux is unnerved that Ren knows -- he chalks it up to Ren's
          Force ability. Kylo Ren heads off.

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           Sir. Ventral cannons hot.

                          GENERAL HUX
           They were going back for the droid --
           send a squad to the wreckage.

          EXT. JAKKU DESERT - DAY

          TIGHT ON FINN'S FACE: His EYES OPEN. He goes from unconscious
          to terrified, fast. He sits up, looks around. CUT BACK
          WIDE: he sits in the middle of an EPIC DESERT, DUNES FOREVER.
          A BLACK CHUTE blows in the wind behind him, scattered debris.
          Then he sees, over distant dunes, RISING BLACK SMOKE. He
          gets up -- moves toward it, calling out:

                          FINN
           Poe! Poe!
          Finn scrambles over the massive dune to the TIE FIGHTER,
          SMOKING AND ON FIRE, small debris around it. He thinks he
          sees POE'S ARM -- he pulls on it, but it's JUST POE'S JACKET.
          He throws that off and tries to find a way in -- even a way
          to LOOK INSIDE, but the smoke and heat make it impossible.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Poe!!! POE!
          Suddenly the ship BEGINS TO SINK -- like it's being CONSUMED
          INTO QUICKSAND -- Finn is slipping in too --

                          FINN (CONT'D)

           POE!!! POE!!!
          It becomes clear fast: if Finn doesn't get away, he's gonna
          get sucked in too! So Finn scampers away from the TIE FIGHTER
          as it SINKS INTO THE SAND! We're in the Sinking Fields. A
          few moments and IT'S GONE.
          Finn's out of breath. Horrified. Then A GIANT EXPLOSION
          ERUPTS FROM below, SENDING SAND AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE!
          Finn sees this, disoriented, scared, exhausted and defeated.
          And all alone.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          ENDLESS DUNES BEHIND HIM, Finn walks, removing pieces of his
          Stormtrooper gear, using Poe's FLIGHT JACKET for shade.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Exhausted, Finn continues his trek across the endless, sandy
          nothingness.

          EXT. DESERT - DAY

          Finn, parched and losing hope, he walks to the edge of a
          massive dune, looks out into the epic valley below. Miles
          ahead: NIIMA OUTPOST.

          General Hux and Kylo Ren walk the length of the bridge.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
           Capture the droid if we can, but
           destroy it if we must.

                          KYLO REN
           How capable are your soldiers,
           General?

                          GENERAL HUX

                          (WITH VITRIOL)
           I won't have you question my methods.

                          KYLO REN
           They're obviously skilled at
           committing high treason. Perhaps
           Leader Snoke should consider using a
           clone army.

                          GENERAL HUX

                          (YOU SON-OF-A-BITCH)
           My men are exceptionally trained --
           programmed from birth--

                          KYLO REN
           Then they should have no problem
           retrieving the droid. Unharmed.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Careful, Ren. That your "personal
           interests" not interfere with orders
           from Leader Snoke.

                          KYLO REN
           I want that map. For your sake, I
           suggest you get it.
          Ren heads off. Hux hates him.

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Sun-scorched and exhausted, Finn stumbles out of the desert
          into the Outpost. In a heatstroke daze he moves past enormous
          old SHIP PARTS, MERCHANTS, SCAVENGERS and TENTED STALLS.

                          FINN
           Water... water... water..
          He sees a WATER TROUGH where a filthy, slobbering hippo-like
          creature (a HAPPABORE) DRINKS. Finn moves to it, uses his
          hands to desperately DRINK the filthy water. After a couple
          swallows he SPITS IT OUT, disgusted.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           -- Awgh, GAH!
          But he's parched and immediately RETURNS FOR MORE.
          ACROSS THE MARKETPLACE, REY kneels with an emphatically

          BEEPING BB-8.
          Just then, TWO of UNKAR'S THUGS approach and stop her. One
          clearly tells her that they're taking the droid. BB-8 reacts
          nervously as Rey resists them -- one pulls a SACK over BB-8
          while the other grabs Rey's arm -- in the tussle, Rey KNOCKS
          OVER METAL URNS for sale --
          Finn, still drinking, is PUSHED OVER by the happabore. He
          falls to the ground, then turns to look when he HEARS
          CRASHING. He sees, through the tents, REY FIGHTING.
          He moves UP CLOSER to help this young woman being accosted --
          but he STOPS when Rey begins to FIGHT BACK -- scrappy and
          feral, she KICKS, BITES and HITS. Finn is taken aback as
          she DEFEATS the attackers, who hit the sand, hard.
          Finn just watches, stunned.
          Rey moves to the COVERED BB-8 -- PULLS THE SACK OFF OF HIM.
          Finn cannot believe his eyes. IT'S POE'S DROID!
          Rey talks to BB-8, who, nervous now, looks around and...
          SEES FINN! BB-8 STARTS BEEPING like crazy. Then something
          insane happens: REY LOOKS AT FINN.

                          REY
           (To BB-8) Who? Him?
          Finn is confused. Rey stands, staring at Finn, defiant.
          Finn can feel trouble coming -- and Rey begins CHARGING AT
          HIM, quarterstaff in hand.
          Realizing he's the target, Finn begins to RUN -- away from
          her, through the tent marketplace. Rey goes after him -- he
          turns a corner -- then another -- then BAM! She's got
          ahead of him and SLAMS HIM TO THE GROUND WITH HER STAFF!
          Finn is on his back, out of breath and freaked out. She
          holds the staff on him threateningly:

                          REY
           What's your hurry, thief?

                          FINN
           What--?! Thief?
          BB-8 ROLLS UP FAST, MOVES TO FINN -- a WELDING ARM TELESCOPES

          FROM HIS BODY AND SHOCKS FINN!

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           OW! HEY! What?!

                          REY
           The jacket! This droid says you
           stole it!

                          FINN
           I've had a pretty messed up day,
           alright?! So I'd appreciate it you
           stop accusing me -- OW!!!
           (BB-8 has ZAPPED him

                          AGAIN)

           STOP IT!

                          REY
           Where'd you get it? It belongs to
           his master.
          Finn looks at her -- then the agitated droid, Finn's mind
          racing. He puts it all together. Frustrated, but sighs
          heavily, needing to respond somehow. So he makes a hard
          decision: to tell the truth.

                          FINN
           It belonged to Poe Dameron. That
           was his name, right?
          Rey and BB-8 react, surprised and wanting more.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           He was captured... by the First Order!
           I helped him escape but our ship
           crashed.

                          (RELIVING IT)
           Poe didn't make it.
           (sees BB-8 is sad,

                          ROLLS OFF)
           Look, I tried to help him. I'm
           sorry...
          BB-8 heads off to the side, depressed. Rey watches BB-8,
          then considers Finn again. Says, a bit impressed:

                          REY
           So you're with the Resistance?

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Finn's mind races again. He makes an easy decision: to lie.

                          FINN
           Obviously. Yes. I am. I'm with
           the Resistance, yeah.

                          (WHISPERS)
           I'm with the Resistance.
          Rey lowers her staff, Finn stands. Rey studies him:

                          REY
           I've never met a Resistance fighter
           before.

                          FINN
           Well, this is what we look like.
           Some of us. Others look different.

                          REY
           BB-8 says he's on a secret mission,
           he has to get back to your base.

                          FINN
           Apparently he's carrying a map that
           leads to Luke Skywalker, and
           everyone's after it.
          She turns to him, concerned, curious. And asks:

                          REY
           Luke Skywalker? I thought he was a
           myth.
          Just then BB-8 BEEPS MADLY at something he sees.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           What is it?
          Rey moves to him, peeks around a tent corner. Now Finn moves
          to see: at a distance, TWO STORMTROOPERS TALKING TO UNKAR'S
          THUGS -- who POINT THEIR WAY!
          Finn urgently grabs her hand and heads for the tents:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           (re: her hand)
           What are you doing?!

                          FINN
           Come on!
          Suddenly LASER BLASTS RIP PAST THEM, HIT THE CLEANING UNIT,
          SPEWING STEAM! Rey SCREAMS -- MORE BLASTS as they run!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - DAY

          Finn and Rey holding hands, the three race, ZIGZAGGING through
          a maze of tents:

           Come on, BB-8!

                          REY
           Let go of me!

                          FINN
           No, we gotta move!

                          REY
           (pulls her hand back)
           I know how to run without you holding
           my hand! BB-8 stay close! This
           way!
          Now Finn and BB-8 follow Rey -- ANOTHER BLAST just missing
          them! They disappear through a tent.
          TRACK FAST WITH STORMTROOPERS, through the tent maze. They
          come out of a tent, HAVING MOMENTARILY LOST THEIR TARGET.

                          STORMTROOPER
           Call in the air strike!
          REY, FINN AND BB-8 duck into another tent:

          INT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

          Rey, Finn and BB-8 move through RUSTY WARES and take cover.
          Quiet, urgent:

                          REY
           They're shooting at both of us!

                          FINN
           Yeah, they saw you with me! You're
           marked!

                          REY
           Well, thanks for that!

                          FINN
           I'm not the one who chased you down
           with a stick! Does anyone have
           blasters around here?!

                          REY

                          (TO BB-8)
           Are you okay?
          Finn QUIETS HER WITH A GESTURE, HEARING SOMETHING.
          PUSH IN ON FINN -- whatever he hears alarms him greatly --
          he GRABS HER HAND AGAIN -- PULLS HER AWAY --

                          REY (CONT'D)
           Stop taking my hand!

          EXT. NIIMA OUTPOST - TENT - DAY

          Finn pulls Rey from the tent -- BB-8 FOLLOWS --
          As they race from the tent a TIE FIGHTER SCREAMS INTO VIEW

          FROM BEHIND THE TENTS! A SECOND FOLLOWS CLOSE BEHIND. IT

          FIRES AT THEM -- A MASSIVE BLAST SENDS REY AND FINN FLYING --

          BB-8 ROLLING!

                         

                         
          WIDE SHOT: TWO TIE FIGHTERS SCREAM OVER the town, the
          EXPLOSION throws sand and debris fifty feet into the air.
          Rey is thrown HARD to the ground -- she is rattled, truly
          afraid. Then she turns: FINN lies nearby, unconscious.
          Suddenly afraid, she scrambles to him, rolls him over. BB-8
          ROLLS OVER, BEEPING in concern.

                          REY
           Hey!
          As Finn comes to, he sees her. Through his fog:

                          FINN
           -- Are you okay?
          And that very question touches her -- having never in her
          life been asked it.

                          REY
           Yeah.
           (extends her hand)
           Follow me.
          Grateful, Finn takes it. They're off.
          LOCALS run amok as TIE fighters DIVE BOMB. REY, Finn and BB-

          8 SPRINT, BLASTER EXPLOSIONS GET CLOSER AND CLOSER!

          Rey, STAFF strapped to her back, leads the way as she, Finn
          and BB-8 race into the spaceport. Finn glances back: TWO
          TIE FIGHTERS BANK their return. They YELL:

                          FINN
           We can't outrun them!
          Rey POINTS to a parked, four-engine SHIP ahead:

                          REY
           We might in that quad-jumper!

                          FINN
           We need a pilot!

                          OFF-CAMERA)
           What about that ship?

                          REY
           That one's garbage!
          They run for the JUMPER but the passing TIE FIGHTERS FIRE AT
          IT, BLOWING IT APART IN A HUGE FLAME BALL! Rey, coming to a
          quick stop, RIGHT UP TO CAMERA:

                          REY (CONT'D)
           The garbage'll do!
          She turns and runs back -- Finn and BB-8 follow as they all
          run toward the piece of junk -- and we see it for the first
          time: THE MILLENNIUM FALCON!
          TIE fighters BANK AROUND AGAIN. Finn, Rey and BB-8 run up
          the ramp of the semi-tarped Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Finn, Rey and BB-8 enter the ship -- she hits a control and
          the door DESCENDS CLOSED as she races to the cockpit:

                          REY
           Gunner position's down there!

          Rey tosses her staff aside, jumps into the pilot's seat,
          frantically flips switches. BB-8 rolls in behind her as the
          ENGINES WHINE to life:

                          REY
           No! This ship hasn't been flown in
           years!

          Finn buckles into the gunner seat -- to his shock the SEAT
          WHIPS TO THE LEFT, startling him -- he grabs the controls to
          steady himself.

          Rey finally REACHES the switches, returns to the yoke,

           lose 'em!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          The ship is HIT AGAIN -- afraid, Rey's mind races as she
          scans the area -- and gets an idea.

                          REY
           Get ready!

          Rey pilots the ship up AND INTO THE REAR OF A CRASHED SUPER

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Finn peers out the window, realizing where they are:

          INT. WRECKED SUPER STAR DESTROYER - DAY

          Falcon GRAZING ONE SIDE, THEN THE OTHER, SPITTING SPARKS!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - DAY

          Rey, scared, girds herself as she quickly runs out of space
          in the wreck.

                          REY
           Oh no!
          Just as the TIE PILOT GETS A LOCK,
          Rey YANKS THE YOKE --

          EXT. DESERT - SPACESHIP GRAVEYARD - DAY

          The Falcon makes a HARD RIGHT TURN out of the Destroyer.
          Rey then CUTS POWER AND FLIPS THE SHIP SO BACK FACES FRONT!
          FINN CAN NOW SEE THE PURSUING TIE FIGHTER! He FIRES,

          DESTROYING IT!
          REY GUNS THE ENGINES again, FLIPS THE FALCON and FLIES AWAY
          as the TIE FIGHTER CRASHES!

                          FINN
           Whooo!
          The Falcon ROARS OFF, victorious, leaving the ship graveyard
          and disappearing into the clouds.

          The Falcon ROARS from Jakku off to space.

          Rey races past BB-8, who is RETRACTING his safety restraints.
          Finn, adrenalized, climbs from the turret, meets Rey in the

           Now that was some I don't know! -- I've
           flying! How did you flown some ships but I've
           do that?! No one never left the planet!

           You set me up for it! (laughs)
           (cocky) It was perfect!
           That was pretty good.
          They're just staring at each other now, seeing something odd
          and weird and wonderful -- two people totally inexperienced
          in joy and camaraderie.
          Bb-8 BEEPS something urgent -- she turns to the droid, kneels.

                          REY (CONT'D)
           You're ok. He's with the Resistance.
           He's going to get you home. We both
           will.

                          (TO FINN)

                          REY
           I'm Rey.
          BB-8 looks at him: really? Finn is reminded: HE'S LIED TO
          HER. She looks at Finn with a sweet smile.

                          FINN
           Rey...
          But before Finn can say anything they JUMP: across the lounge,
          STEAM BURSTS from under the grating.

                          REY
           Help me with this! Quick!
          They hurry to the grating, PULL IT UP together. BB-8 rolls
          over, watches.

                          FINN
           Whoa! What's going on?
          She goes below as BB-8 BEEPS concern.

          Lieutenant Mitaka moves to Ren, who looks out across the
          star field. Mitaka swallows, uneasy with his task.

           Sir. We were unable to acquire the

          Ren turns to look at him, he says nothing.

           LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
           It escaped capture aboard a stolen
           Corellian YT model freighter.

           Not exactly, sir. It had help.
          Ren says nothing. Which says everything. Mitaka sweats.

           LIEUTENANT MITAKA (CONT'D)
           We have no confirmation, but we
           believe FN-2187 may have been helped
           in the escape--
          Ren IGNITES HIS LIGHTSABER, TURNS AND SLASHES AT THE CONSOLE
          BEHIND HIM! HOLD ON Mitaka, who reacts, looks away -- winces.
          The horrible SOUNDS of Ren's rage continues. Finally Mitaka
          looks up. The metallic wall behind Ren is RIPPED with glowing
          scars.

                          KYLO REN
           Anything else?
          Mitaka hates to say the following, but:

                          LIEUTENANT MITAKA
           The two were accompanied by a girl.
          Ren reaches out -- Mitaka is suddenly, violently PULLED TOWARD
          REN, into his black glove:

                          KYLO REN
           What girl?

          Rey's head POPS up from under the grating, surrounded by

           They're hunting for us now, we gotta

          Rey re-emerges, Finn hands her the wrench.

                          REY
           BB-8 said the location of the
           Resistance Base is "need to know" --

           This?
          She catches it and goes under again, leaving Finn and BB-8
          alone. He contemplates telling her the truth. This is his
          moment. But instead he knees to BB-8, says quietly, urgently:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           You gotta tell us where the base is.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           I don't speak that. Alright, between
           us, I'm not with the Resistance,
           okay?

           -- I'm just trying to get away from

           Droid, please.
          Rey pops up again:

                          REY
           Pilex driver, hurry!
          Finn moves for the tool.

           No, it's true: we're the only ones
           on board.

           You can understand that thing?

                          HAN
           And "that thing" can understand you
           too, so watch it. Come on outta
           there.
          They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull
          himself out.

           I stole it from Unkar Plutt. He
           stole it from the Irving Boys, who
           stole it from Ducain.

           Who stole it from me! Well, you

           the Millennium Falcon for good.
          Han walks away, takes in the ship: it's his again. Doesn't
          see that Rey is awed. His back to all of them, he smiles.
          Chewie responds as Han heads toward the cockpit.

          LANDING ON THE FREIGHTER. Han is fearful.

          One of the Kanjiklubbers begins moving down the corridor,

          FINN AND REY, in a QUIET PANIC BELOW: THEY START CRAWLING
          FAST in the opposite direction they came.
          Rey crawls off fast, Finn follows. They quickly arrive at

          Rey begins RESETTING the FUSES, SPARKS shooting from them as
          they do. Finn quickly joins in.
          Rey and Finn FINISH resetting the fuses boxes. Rey smiles
          optimistically. Finn looks hopeful too.
          DOWN AN EMPTY ROW OF LARGE CONTAINERS, which OPEN -- and a

          SLITHERS OUT OF ITS CAGE!
          BACK UP TOP as BANKS OF LIGHTS BEGIN GOING OFF, ONE BY ONE.
          The GANGS look around.

          Han, Chewie and BB-8 race down the hall -- A MEMBER OF THE
          KANJIKLUB GANG comes around the corner. Han PUNCHES him
          with one blow, throws him toward the Rathtar. They keep
          steppin....

          INT. CARGO SHIP - BELOW FLOOR GRATING - DAY

          Rey and Finn hurriedly crawl through the space below decks.

                          FINN
           This was a mistake!

                          REY
           Huge!

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR A - DAY

          Two Guavian Death Gang members run through the ship -- passing
          Tasu Leech, who sees another Kanjiklub member down the
          corridor -- who gets GRABBED BY A TENTACLE! Tasu tries to
          help him, but he gets PULLED UP AND AWAY! Tasu hears a
          distant terror-scream of a Rathtar, and runs the other way.
          Other Kanjiklub members YELL at him to avoid that direction --
          they all turn a corner -- a RATHTAR IS THERE AND GRABS THE
          TWO OTHERS! Tasu FIRES at the beast and RUNS OFF -- and we
          land on a FLOOR HATCH, which opens. Rey and Finn climb out,
          quickly.

                         
          They turn a corridor --

                          REY
           What do they look like?

          RATHTAR! Rey COVERS HER MOUTH.

                          FINN
           They look like that.
          Finn yanks her away. They race around another corner -- a

          RATHTAR IS THERE!

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           This way!

                          REY

          They scream and run off -- but Finn is GRABBED, PULLED AWAY

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR E - DAY

          TIGHT ON FINN as he's being yanked down the hall, SCREAMING
          as he struggles to get loose!
          Rey turns the corner -- Finn is gone -- nowhere to be seen.

                          REY

           FINN!!!!
          Without Finn, she is instantly distraught -- then she
          realizes: SHE'S JUST PASSED A CONTROL PANEL! Her eyes light
          up as she moves to it: a BANK OF VIDEO MONITORS OF THE SHIP --
          and there's Finn, being dragged by a Rathtar toward an OPEN
          BLAST DOOR. Rey's hand on the button, she waits... then

          SLAMS THE BUTTON!

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR B - DAY

          The BLAST DOOR INSTANTLY CLOSES ON ONE OF THE RATHTAR'S
          TENTACLES! It SCREAMS IN PAIN, ITS SEVERED TENTACLE STILL
          WRAPPED AROUND FINN'S LEG! Finn scrambles up, desperately
          shaking the sticky tentacle off his leg!
          Rey arrives, runs to Finn, beaming to see him alive -- he is
          adrenaline-rushed, in shock:

                          REY
           Finn!

                          FINN

          ANOTHER CORRIDOR - Finn and Rey run towards the Falcon.

          INT. CARGO SHIP CORRIDOR D - DAY

          Han, Chewie and BB-8 take cover, Han exchanging BLASTER FIRE
          with GANG MEMBERS AT THE OTHER END OF THE HALL.

                          HAN
           I got the door. Cover us!
          Chewie GROAN-AGREES. Chewie FIRES DOWN THE HALL as Han
          CROSSES THE CORRIDOR, BB-8 following nervously. As Chewie
          exchanges blaster fire, Han works the controls.
          THE HATCH OPENS (FALCON in the distance) -- just as CHEWIE
          IS HIT IN THE SHOULDER BY ENEMY FIRE! He goes down with a

          LOUD GROAN!

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Chewie! You okay?
          Han GRABS CHEWIE'S BOWCASTER, FIRES at the DOOR CONTROLS,

          BADASS!

                          HAN (CONT'D)

          INT. CARGO SHIP HANGAR - DAY

          Run with Finn and Rey as they turn into the hangar, toward
          the Falcon. Han helps WOUNDED CHEWIE up the ramp, sees them.

           Han!
          Finn and Rey race past BB-8 -- as they go up the ramp, Han
          says to Rey:

                          HAN
           You, close the door behind us!

                          (TO FINN)
           You take care of Chewie!
          Han and Rey race up the ramp as Finn heads up with Chewie,
          who SCREAMS WILDLY IN PAIN!

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Han stands at the navicomputer, hitting switches. Rey enters
          fast, moves past him to Chewie's seat.

                          HAN

           I hate that guy.
          Han sits as, Rey hitting buttons:

                          REY
           And you could use a co-pilot.

           I never ask that question until after
           I've done it.
          A RATHTAR JUMPS ONTO THE WINDSHIELD -- REY SCREAMS! Its
          GIANT MOUTH CHEWING AT THE GLASS! Han works the controls:

           Compressor.
          Han doesn't like it but she's right -- he hits the switch
          again and the HYPERDRIVE FIRES! The hangar is FILLED WITH
          LIGHTSPEED BLAST as the ATTACKING GANG MEMBERS ARE BLASTED
          BACK LIKE DRY LEAVES. In the cockpit the RATHTAR RIPS AWAY
          as THE STARS STRETCH LIKE ELASTIC and we CUT TO:

          A pair of TIE fighters roar towards a magnificent PLANET,
          frozen WHITE. This is the STARKILLER BASE, a natural planet
          that has been hacked and modified into something sinister.
          Over this we HEAR a DEEP, almost SOOTHING VOICE. A voice
          very much in control, of power:

           SNOKE (V.O.)
           The droid will soon be delivered to
           the Resistance...

          KYLO REN and General Hux in a dark space, looking UPWARD at
          someone addressing them.
          We're in a massive and dark ASSEMBLY ROOM. Hundreds of DESKS
          in a stadium arc, focused on a platform where we see SUPREME
          LEADER SNOKE. Not entirely human, at nearly twenty-five
          feet tall. All of him a STONY GREY. Old, wounded, fragile
          and powerful, all at the same time.

           ... Leading them to the last Jedi.
           If Skywalker returns, the new Jedi
           will rise.

           change.

                          GENERAL HUX
           The weapon. It is ready. I believe
           the time has come to use it. We
           shall destroy the government that
           supports the Resistance, the Republic.
           Without their friends to protect
           them, the Resistance will be
           vulnerable, and we will stop them
           before they reach Skywalker.
          Snoke considers. Almost seems to die for a moment. Then:

                          SNOKE
           Go. Oversee preparations.

                          GENERAL HUX
           Yes, Supreme Leader.
          General Hux, proud, cocksure, exits. Kylo Ren watches him
          go. Snoke SITS. A new intimacy in his voice.

                          SNOKE
           There's been an awakening. Have you
           felt it?

                          KYLO REN
           Yes.

                          SNOKE
           There's something more. The droid
           we seek is aboard the Millennium
           Falcon. In the hands of your father,
           Han Solo.
          Kylo Ren reacts with subtle, but real, surprise.

                          KYLO REN
           He means nothing to me.

                          SNOKE
           Even you, master of the Knights of
           Ren, have never faced such a test.

                          SNOKE
           We shall see. We shall see.
          A gentle, satisfied nod from Snoke, and Kylo Ren, obsessed,
          filled up, exits. Snoke watches him disappear, a grotesque
          evil SMILE growing -- as he DISINTEGRATES -- Snoke has been
          a HOLOGRAM all along.

          Han at the controls when all the alarms STOP. Rey, satisfied,

           Nah, don't say that, you did great.
           Just rest.
          Han turns to Finn, who sits at the HOLOCHESS set, BB-8 beside
          him. This is awkward for Han, but damn, he means it:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           Good job, kid. And thanks.

                          FINN
           You're welcome.
          Finn has accidentally hit a button on the chess set, and the
          PIECES appear, looking up at Finn, curiously. The pieces
          start to FIGHT as Finn fiddles with the controls, trying to
          turn it off.

           ... I'm just a scavenger.
          Han gives Finn a skeptical once-over as Finn finally manages
          to TURN THE CHESS SET OFF as Rey enters. Han looks to BB-8.

          BB-8 rolls forward -- and suddenly PROJECTS A HOLOGRAPHIC

          MAP, FILLING THE ROOM. PLANETS, STARS, SYSTEMS.
          They all react. Chewie sits to look up. Han moves through
          stars, becomes reflective.

                          HAN
           This map's not complete. It's just
           a piece. Ever since Luke disappeared,
           people have been looking for him.

                          REY
           Why'd he leave?

                          HAN
           He was training a new generation of
           Jedi. One boy, an apprentice turned
           against him, destroyed it all. Luke
           felt responsible... He walked away
           from everything.

           There're a lot of rumors. Stories.
           The people who knew him the best
           think he went looking for the first
           Jedi temple.

           The Jedi were real?

           I used to wonder that myself. Thought
           it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo --
           magical power holding together good,
           evil, the dark side and the light.

          some switches. BB-8 cuts off the hologram. Chewie rises
          and moans to Han, but Han motions for Chewie to lay back

          The Falcon CRESTS OVER an ENDLESS GREEN FOREST TO REVEAL a
          CASTLE on a picturesque LAKE.
          The Falcon lands near the castle, among dozens of WORN,
          smallish freighters.

          Rey steps off the Falcon, UP TO CAMERA, BB-8 at her side.

           I do. They'll slaughter us. We all
           need to run.
          Rey is stunned. Maz, not so much. She crawls back to her
          chair. She points to some pirates in the corner.

                          MAZ
           You see those two? They'll trade
           work for transportation to the Outer
           Rim. There, you can disappear.
          Finn sees them. Considers.

                          REY
           Finn!

                          FINN
           Come with me.

                          REY
           What about BB-8? We're not done
           yet. We have to get him back to
           your base.

                          FINN
           I can't.
          Finn stands to leave. He offers the gun back to Han.

                          HAN
           Keep it, kid.
          Finn heads off. Rey gets up to follow. Maz dials her lenses
          back to normal, and turns to Han.

                          MAZ
           Who's the girl?

                         ON FINN
          Who has arrived at the table with the ALIEN SMUGGLERS.

                          FINN
           I was told you could get me to the
           Outer Rim.
          Rey barges into the conversation, interrupting.

                          REY
           What are you doing?
          Finn gets up to talk to her.

                          FINN
           (to Big Head)
           Don't leave without me.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Embarrassed, Finn moves her away.

                          REY
           You can't just go. I won't let you.

                          FINN
           I'm not who you think I am.

                          REY
           Finn, what are you talking about?

                          FINN
           I'm not Resistance. I'm not a hero.
           I'm a Stormtrooper.

                          (STOPS HER)
           Like all of them, I was taken from a
           family I'll never know. And raised
           to do one thing...

                          (EMOTIONAL)
           But my first battle, I made a choice.
           I wasn't going to kill for them. So
           I ran.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Right into you. And you looked at
           me like no one ever had. I was
           ashamed of what I was. But I'm done
           with the First Order. I'm never
           going back. Rey, come with me.

                          REY
           Don't go.

                          FINN
           Take care of yourself. Please.
          Rey looks at him, crushed. With quiet resignation, Rey
          watches Finn return to the aliens...
          And all three head off. He gets to the front door and walks
          through it.
          Rey is heartsick, but she turns as she hears the sound of a
          young girl in anguish, crying. She follows the sound into
          the castle, turning so she can't see that Finn has looked
          back at her one last time.

          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Rey steps down into the basement corridor. BB-8 follows
          her. Walking carefully and confused, she is not sure why
          she's down here. She can hear the echoing sounds of a young
          girl crying. She heads down the hall... to the very end,
          where there is a door. It is almost as if a SOULFUL VIBRATION
          draws her closer. She looks at the door lock -- AND THE

          DOOR OPENS.
          Hesitant, Rey enters.

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - CRYPT ROOM - DAY

          Rey moves into the dark, small, vaulted storage room. Old
          treasures line the floors and walls, but there is something
          specific Rey is drawn to: on a table, an old wooden BOX.
          She moves to it, unsure, afraid, as if an energy from inside
          the box has been calling her here. BB-8 nervously follows.
          Rey reaches out, very slowly, to touch the box. A moment
          heavy with tension.
          Rey OPENS THE BOX and sees inside Luke Skywalker's original
          lightsaber. With hesitation, she reaches towards it, but
          she cannot resist. As her hand makes contact with it, there
          is the piercing sound of a lightsaber igniting. She moves
          her hand away, as REY HEARS A MECHANICAL BREATHING sound.
          The CAMERA MOVES, LIGHTING CHANGES -- and we see behind her
          something impossible: a HALLWAY OF FROM DEEP INSIDE CLOUD
          CITY. Disembodied voices fill the air.

                          YOUNG GIRL

           NO!
          She stands -- looks around, confused by all she sees and
          hears. -- Turns and sees, through a DOORWAY.
          We follow Rey and she runs down the corridor, but it all
          TILTS -- TURNS -- and she lands on the
          WALL -- which is now the GROUND -- dried GRASS.
          She turns to look -- we PIVOT -- and see a BURNING TEMPLE AT
          NIGHT. We PAN to:
          R2-D2 -- who watches the flames -- and a MAN appears (LUKE,
          whose face we do not see). He falls to his knees, reaches
          out to the droid -- with a MECHANICAL RIGHT HAND.
          We PUSH IN ON REY as RAIN BEGINS -- and DAY TURNS TO NIGHT --
          and she LOOKS UP -- we TILT UP --
          To see we're LOOKING UP AT A WARRIOR as he is STABBED BY A
          FIERY LIGHTSABER! He screams and falls to the ground -- we
          FOLLOW HIM, revealing Rey again, now in a nighttime
          battlefield. She gets to her feet, frightened by what she
          sees. We PIVOT AROUND HER to REVEAL KYLO REN, and the six
          other KNIGHTS OF REN, who flank him!
          Come back around to Rey, soaking now, as the RAIN STOPS and
          SUNLIGHT illuminates her -- she turns to look -- we PIVOT --
          and see...
          A little girl. Rey as a child. She is sobbing, hysterical.
          Unkar Plutt's meaty hand holds her thin arm. She is on Jakku,
          watching a starship fly into the sky, abandoning her.

                          YOUNG GIRL
           No, come back!

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          UNKAR PLUTT
           Quiet, girl!
          The ship flies towards the desert sun, which is strangely
          eclipsed, as if being eaten by darkness. Rey looks around
          her to see she is..
          In a NIGHTTIME, BARREN, SNOWY WOODS. She's losing her mind,
          confounded and lost and she gets to her feet, her breath
          seen in the frigid air -- and then: THE SOUND OF CLASHING
          LIGHTSABERS! She moves through the woods, toward the sound.
          Rey runs, heart pounding, when KYLO REN EMERGES FROM BEHIND
          A TREE! She stops, SCREAMS, FALLS BACK and LANDS IN:

          INT. MAZ' CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          She falls back, out of the room, suddenly sitting in the
          hall, out of breath, alarmed and perplexed.
          She HEARS something and turns to look.
          Maz stands at the end of the corridor, realizing what has
          just happened.

                          REY
           What was that? I shouldn't have
           gone in there.

                          MAZ
           That lightsaber was Luke's. And his
           father's before him and now, it calls
           to you!
          Rey stands, fast. Still overwhelmed, emotional, speechless.

                          REY
           I have to get back to Jakku.

                          MAZ
           Han told me.
           (reaches out, hold

                          REY'S HAND)
           Dear child. I see your eyes. You
           already know the truth. Whomever
           you're waiting for on Jakku, they're
           never coming back. But... there's
           someone who still could.

                          REY
           Luke.

                          MAZ
           The belonging you seek is not behind
           you. It is ahead. I am no Jedi,
           but I know the Force. It moves
           through and surrounds every living
           thing. Close your eyes. Feel it.

           The light. It's always been there.
           It will guide you. The saber. Take
           it.
          Rey suddenly stands.

                          REY
           I'm never touching that again. I
           don't want any part of this.
          And Rey runs off, passing Maz.
          Rey's mind is spinning -- she can't take it -- she turns and
          heads off, fast. BB-8 follows her. TIGHT ON MAZ, watching
          her go. Maz SIGHS, feeling for the young girl.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          Rey exits the castle, needs to run, but doesn't know where.
          Heads toward the woods.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey moves through the foliage, heart racing. Over this, we
          HEAR a RUMBLING -- intense, an OMEN of something horrible to
          come.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY

          A massive rally: a thousand STORMTROOPERS, TIE FIGHTERS,
          OFFICERS and VEHICLES. BRUTALIST STRUCTURES, mountainous
          SNOWY LANDSCAPE. Addressing them at a podium, flanked by
          RED FIRST ORDER BANNERS, is HUX. His voice ECHOES:

                          GENERAL HUX
           Today is the end of the Republic!
           The end of a regime that acquiesces
           to disorder! At this very moment,
           in a system far from here the New
           Republic LIES to the GALAXY while
           secretly supporting the treachery of
           the loathsome Resistance. This fierce
           machine which you have built, upon
           which we stand, will bring an end to
           the Senate! To their cherished fleet!
           All remaining systems will bow to
           the First Order! And will remember
           this... as the last day of the
           Republic!

                         

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - DAY

          ENGINEERS perform FINAL FIRING PROTOCOL. There's a sense of
          nervousness -- WILL THIS MASSIVE WEAPON ACTUALLY WORK?

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY AREA - DAY


                          GENERAL HUX

           FIRE!
          And Hux TURNS to give the signal as we CUT BACK WIDE -- a
          ROAR OF BOOTS ON PAVEMENT as the thousand Stormtroopers TURN
          to face an endless snowy landscape. WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN?!

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - DAY

          A view PAST THE RALLY. For a moment, nothing. Then, eerily

          SILENT, AN IMPOSSIBLE BLAST OF FIRE LIGHT -- LIKE AN ATOMIC

          BOMB TEST TIMES A ZILLION -- BLASTS FROM MILES AWAY, INTO
          THE SKY! Seconds later, a TERRIBLE EXPLOSIVE ROAR!
          The Troopers -- everyone -- is nearly PUSHED BACK by the
          FORCE of it -- the magnitude! Many have to COVER THEIR EYES!
          For MILES around the FIREBEAM, ICE AND SNOW MELTS INSTANTLY!
          Runoff tunnels FLOODED with AN OCEAN OF FRESH WATER. AIRBORNE
          CREATURES by the thousands burst from trees and take flight.
          Hux watches, his eyes WILD WITH POWER AND EVIL. From HIS
          eyes, CUT TO:

          INT. STAR DESTROYER BRIDGE - DAY

          TIGHT ON KYLO REN as he watches the Starkiller firing.

          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE - DAY

          Finn boards the Alien Freighter. The SOUND FROM THE SKY
          makes him turn back. He sees the PATH OF FIRE and his blood
          runs cold, his heart sinks.

          EXT. REPUBLIC SYSTEM - NIGHT

          At a massive distance we see PLANETS THE REPUBLIC CAPITAL

          SYSTEM -- INCREASINGLY LIT, THEN POWERFULLY HIT BY THE VAST

          FIREBLAST WHICH OBLITERATES IT ALL!

          EXT. REPUBLIC CITY - NIGHT

          The galaxy CENTER OF GOVERNMENT at NIGHT. Impressive
          structures. Senators and dignitaries look in uncomprehending
          horror to the night sky. LIGHT GROWING --
          FROM A GREAT DISTANCE a CIRCLE OF FIRE -- LIKE A SMALL SUN

          APPEARING FROM NOWHERE AND GROWING CLOSE AND MASSIVE, TURNING
          NIGHT TO DAY! And in seconds THE FIRE BLOCKS OUT EVERYTHING

          ELSE, AND THE ENTIRE PLANET OF HOSNIAN PRIME IS INCINERATED!

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE - DAY

          A crowd of ALIENS files out from inside, all eyes on the
          FIRE IN THE SKY. Dozens of LANGUAGES exclaiming fear and
          horror. Find Han and Chewie moving out, looking up.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

           FINN (O.S.)
           It was the Republic.
          Han and Chewie turn as Finn arrives, moving quickly through
          the crowd. With dread:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           The First Order, they've done it.
           Where's Rey?

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the forest and finally comes to a stop,
          overwhelmed and exhausted. At an emotional breaking point,
          she has no idea where to go, who to turn to. Then she HEARS
          A BEEP -- turns to see BB-8, catching up with her.

                          REY
           What are you doing?

                          (HE BEEPS)
           You have to go back.
           (he BEEPS again)

                          REY (CONT'D)
           BB-8. No, you can't -- you have to
           go back, you're too important.
           They'll help you.
          Then, ANOTHER SOUND -- LOUDER NOW -- they LOOK UP AGAIN: in
          front of the system attack, A FLEET OF FIRST ORDER SHIPS
          ROAR OVERHEAD, TOWARD THE CASTLE! Rey's heart sinks: HER

          FRIENDS ARE IN DANGER!

          INT. MAZ'S CASTLE - BASEMENT CORRIDOR - DAY

          Maz leads Han, Finn and Chewie down the hall, fast:

                          MAZ
           I've had this for ages...

          MAZ'S CASTLE - TREASURE ROOM - DAY
          Maz opens the box -- holds out the lightsaber to Finn:

                          MAZ
           Kept it locked away.

                          HAN
           Where'd you get that?

                          MAZ
           A good question for another time.

                          (TO FINN)
           Take it! Find your friend!
          Finn grabs it as the room is SHAKEN by an above ground attack.

                          MAZ (CONT'D)
           Those beasts! They're here!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey and BB-8 race fast back toward the castle -- EXPLOSION
          SOUNDS can be HEARD from the direction they're headed!

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey races through the trees -- sees Maz' castle -- BEING
          DESTROYED BY FIRST ORDER SHIPS! Aliens RUNNING, GETTING
          OBLITERATED by SCREAMING TIE FIGHTERS! Other TIE FIGHTERS
          and TRANSPORTERS LAND, STORMTROOPERS in attack.
          Just then, filtered RADIO CALLS get Rey's attention: nearby
          STORMTROOPERS have spotted her, AND FIRE!

                          STORMTROOPER
           FN-417, hold position!
          Rey takes cover, grabs her BLASTER -- but IT WON'T FIRE!
          She panics, then realizes:

                          REY
           Safety!
          SHE SWITCHES OFF THE SAFETY and FIRES BACK! HITS TWO TROOPERS
          and retreats, calls to BB-8:
          BB-8 follows Rey AWAY FROM THE CASTLE, firing back at more
          chasing Troopers!

          EXT. MAZ' CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Kylo Ren moves through the DEBRIS. A Stormtrooper approaches:

                          STORMTROOPER #4
           Sir, the droid was spotted heading
           west, with a girl.
          Kylo Ren LOOKS BACK SHARPLY, in Rey's direction --

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Rey and BB-8 move swiftly, terrified -- she stops them:

                          REY
           You have to keep going, stay out of
           sight, I'll try to fight 'em off.
           (BB-8 BEEPS; bravely
           through her fear)
           I hope so, too.
          BB-8 BEEPS and heads off -- Rey RUNS and TAKES COVER behind
          a massive, mossy tree. TIGHT on her TERRIFIED FACE --

          EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

          Han, Chewie, Finn and Maz, exhausted, CLIMB UP, peek through
          debris.

           Come on, Chewie!
          Maz turns to Finn:

                          MAZ
           Rey and BB-8, they need you. Now
           go.

                          FINN
           I need a weapon.
          Maz grabs his wrist -- holds up his hand -- THE SABER.

                          MAZ
           You have one!
          He looks at her questioningly -- he's supposed to use the
          lightsaber?! He TURNS IT ON.
          HAN AND CHEWIE RUN, TAKE COVER from BLASTS, FIRING BACK at
          Stormtroopers, taking some out!

                          HAN
           Hey, can I try that?
          Han borrows Chewbacca's bowcaster, fires on Stormtroopers
          and sends them flying.

                          HAN (CONT'D)

                          (TO CHEWBACCA)
           I like this thing.
          FINN SURPRISES A STORMTROOPER WITH THE LIGHTSABER, then
          another! Untrained, he's athletic, brave, impressive. One
          Stormtrooper has a MACE --

                          STORMTROOPER
           Traitor!
          FINN and the TROOPER WITH THE MACE battle. The Mace Trooper
          KNOCKS FINN DOWN! The Stormtrooper is about to end him,
          when THE STORMTROOPER IS SHOT AND FALLS!
          Wide-eyed Finn sees Han run over, having fired the blast!
          Han helps him up.

                          HAN
           You okay, Big deal?

                         

                          FINN
           Thanks!
          But TEN STORMTROOPERS come over a RISE, BLASTERS AIMED.

                          STORMTROOPER

          Han's MIND RACES as a SQUAD OF TROOPERS appears behind them.
          Finn, Han and Chewie are MARCHED by Stormtroopers back toward
          a transport, hands on their heads.
          But then -- A FAMILIAR ROAR RIPPING ACROSS THE LAKE -- Han
          turns -- they all do: coming toward them across the water, X-

           It's the Resistance.
          One X-WING in particular -- MARKED IN BLACK -- SWOOPS DOWN

          The Stormtroopers around Finn, Han and Chewie SCATTER, TOSSED
          in EXPLOSIONS! The LIGHTSABER LANDS AGAIN -- FINN PICKS IT

          UP.

                          HAN
           Quick!
          Chewie picks up his Bowcaster, Han takes the blaster. Shoots
          a Trooper.

                          FINN

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          In the darkened woods, Rey, terrified, keeps her blaster
          aimed. Her eyes dart around for her pursuer.
          And then: THE UNIQUE SOUND OF KYLO REN'S RASPING LIGHTSABER
          COMING TO LIFE -- A SOUND she's HEARD BEFORE in the FORCEBACK.
          Rey's heart skips a beat: she's even more scared now.
          Kylo Ren appears from behind a tree -- Rey FIRES again and
          again -- Kylo Ren moves toward her, USING HIS LIGHTSABER TO

          DEFLECT EVERY BLAST.
          She FIRES ferociously, but Kylo Ren keeps coming! His hand
          rises -- Rey suddenly STOPS -- GASPS -- UNABLE TO MOVE.

                          KYLO REN
           The girl I've heard so much about.
          He walks AROUND HER, slowly, she won't let herself cry.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           The droid.
          He comes around to see her face. After a scary beat he WHIPS

          HIS SABER UP TO HER EYES, ILLUMINATING HER FACE.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           Where is it?

          WIDE SHOT: THE EPIC BATTLE BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND FIRST

          ORDER TROOPS, REFLECTED IN THE STILL LAKE.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS SABER, reaches up... and REACHES
          TOWARDS REY'S FACE. She can't move, strains in agony. After
          a beat, surprised by what he finds, he removes his hand.
          She is relieved but still afraid.

                          KYLO REN
           The map. You've seen it.
          Rey is horrified. He TOUCHES HER FACE again: the pain, tears
          stream. Kylo Ren, taking more from her mind...
          She stares at him, TERRIFIED, straining in agony --
          Kylo Ren, mid-interrogation, TURNS TOWARD THE SOUND OF THE
          EXPLOSIONS. Stormtroopers APPROACH through the woods.

                          STORMTROOPER #5
           Sir, Resistance fighters! We need
           more troops.
          Kylo Ren TURNS BACK TO Rey, his hand still on her face.

           Pull the division out. Forget the
           droid. We have what we need.
          A GESTURE from Kylo Ren and REY LOSES CONSCIOUSNESS, FALLS

          FROM FRAME!

          EXT. CASTLE DEBRIS - DAY

          The BLACK-MARKED X-WING SWOOPS DOWN again, FIRING, EXPLODING
          another TIE Fighter! On the ground:

                          STORMTROOPER
           Pull back the tree line!
          Han and Chewie dodge debris, FIRING and TAKING OUT TROOPERS.
          FINN takes out 2 TROOPERS with the blaster, then, out of
          breath, turns to see: Kylo Ren in the forest, CARRYING REY
          IN HIS ARMS, INTO HIS SHUTTLE! Finn's heart SHATTERS --
          Han stops -- turns -- sees Kylo Ren entering his shuttle.
          Han is ROCKED.

                          FINN

           NO!! REY!!!
          Heroically, Finn runs toward the shuttle through LASER BLASTS
          AND EXPLOSIONS, but the shuttle TAKES OFF -- Finn irrationally

          CHASES IT, SCREAMS DESPERATELY:

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           No, no, no, no... REY!!
          In crazed frustration, Finn stops running, watches the
          receding First Order ships, Rey their captive.

          EXT. FOREST - DAY

          BB-8 moves fast, then stops and looks up as the First Order
          ships RETREAT, OFF PLANET. A considered beat, and BB-8 heads

          BACK FOR THE CASTLE.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Post battle. Finn runs to Han:

                          FINN
           He took her! Did you see that? He
           took her. She's gone!

                          HAN

                          (WALKS PAST)
           Yeah, yeah, I know...
          And he and Chewie head off.

          EXT. MAZ'S CASTLE RUINS - DAY

          Han moves toward a RESISTANCE TRANSPORT landing in the debris.
          BB-8 rolls up beside him, in wait for the transport.
          ON HAN'S FACE, knowing exactly what's about to happen.
          Finally, the transport door opens.
          And standing there is LEIA.
          She sees Han and is stunned. A silent beat, husband and
          wife reunited for the first time in years. In the smoke and
          embers, no one says a word.
          Then C-3PO walks out from the transport, into the field:

                          C-3PO
           Goodness! Han Solo! It is I, See-
           Threepio!
           (sees Han, stops)
           You probably don't recognize me
           because of the red arm.
           (sees Leia,

                          INCREASINGLY AWKWARD)
           Look who it is! Did you see who?
           Oh. Excuse me, Prin-- uh, General.
           Sorry. Come along, BB-8. Quickly.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           Yes, I must get my proper arm
           reinstalled.
          He hurries off. Finally, alone again.

                          HAN
           You changed your hair.

                          LEIA
           Same jacket.

                          HAN
           No, new jacket.
          Chewie glad to see Leia, greets her with a hug. Chewie MOANS
          a few words, looks at Han then boards the ship.
          It is complicated and loving and painful. Han says, quietly:

                          HAN (CONT'D)
           ... I saw him. Leia, I saw our son.
           He was here.
          Leia hears this.
          Maz watches through the smoke.

          LARGE GRASS MOUNDS cover HANGARS, beneath the odd, giant
          trees. BOOM DOWN as RESISTANCE GROUND CREW direct an X-WING
          to a LANDING. In the FOREGROUND, another X-wing canopy OPENS,
          a PILOT climbs out. PAN TO REVEAL the landed Millennium
          Falcon. Finn runs down the ramp, UP TO CAMERA, desperate,
          searching.
          Then BB-8 SPEEDS RIGHT PAST HIM, almost knocking him down --
          Finn watches as BB-8 rolls over to the PILOT GETTING OUT OF
          THE BLACK-MARKED X-WING. The Pilot's helmet comes off.

          IT IS POE!
          Finn can't believe what he's seeing. And Poe, kneeling in
          WARM REUNION with BB-8, listens and reacts to something the
          droid tells him. Poe looks up and sees Finn -- and he can't
          believe it either! Poe smiles, points at Finn. From a
          distance, Finn gestures in sheer amazement that Poe is alive.

                          FINN
           Poe. Poe Dameron.
          They move to each other -- and embrace.

          enters, studying it, dispirited. PAN as she moves, REVEALING
          HAN. C-3PO is here and some others.

                          C-3PO
           General, I regret to inform you, but
           this map recovered from BB-8 is only
           partially complete. And even worse,
           it matches no charted system on
           record. We simply do not have enough
           information to locate Master Luke.

                          LEIA
           I can't believe I was so foolish to
           think that I could just find Luke
           and bring him home.

                          HAN
           Leia...

                          LEIA
           Don't do that.

                          HAN
           Do what?
           She heads off.

                          LEIA
           Anything.
           Flummoxed, Han follows looking at C-3PO.

                          C-3PO
           Princesses.
          Han follows Leia across the base floor:

                          HAN
           I'm trying to be helpful!

                          LEIA
           When did that ever help? And don't
           say the Death Star.

          LOW WITH BB-8 as he rolls over and finds, under a dark and
          dusty tarp in a corner, R2-D2. BB-8 BEEPS at R2, pulls off
          the tarp and tries to start a conversation. But R2 DOESN'T
          RESPOND AT ALL. BB-8 tries again. Nothing. BB-8 NUDGES
          R2. Nothing. Then:

           C-3PO (O.S.)
           BB-8. You're wasting your time.
          BB-8 looks up at C-3PO, who stands there. C-3PO SIGHS.

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           It is very doubtful that R2 would
           have the rest of the map in his backup
           data.

                          (BB-8 BEEPS)
           I am afraid not. R2-D2 has been in
           low power mode ever since Master
           Luke went away. Sadly, he may never
           be his old self again.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Leia hears the change in Han's voice and softens. She turns.

                          HAN
           Listen to me, will you? I know every
           time you... every time you look at
           me, you're reminded of him.

                          LEIA
           You think I want to forget him? I
           want him back!
          Han looks at her with sympathy.

                          HAN
           There was nothing we could've done.
           (hard for him to say)
           There was too much Vader in him.

                          LEIA
           That's why I wanted him to train
           with Luke. I just never should have
           sent him away. That's when I lost
           him. That's when I lost you both.

                          HAN
           We both had to deal with it in our
           own way. I went back to the only
           thing I was ever good at.

                          LEIA
           We both did.

                          HAN
           We lost our son, forever.

                          LEIA
           No.

                          (LONG BEAT)
           It was Snoke.
          Han takes this in.

                          LEIA (CONT'D)
           He seduced our son to the dark side.
           But we can still save him. Me.
           You.

                          HAN
           If Luke couldn't reach him, how could

           I?

                          LEIA
           Luke is a Jedi... you're his father.
           There's still light in him. I know
           it.

                          GENERAL STATURA
           General, the reconnaissance report
           on the enemy base is coming.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          Rey wakes, disoriented. She is in an angled, upright
          restraining rig. Looks over, startled to see Kylo Ren, mask
          in place, standing there.

                          REY
           Where am I?

                          KYLO REN

                          (LONG BEAT)
           You're my guest.

                          REY
           Where are the others?

                          KYLO REN
           You mean the murderers, traitors and
           thieves you call friends?
           (Rey stares at him)
           You'll be relieved to hear that I
           have no idea.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Rey studies him. She's fearful... but curious.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           You still want to kill me.

                          REY
           That happens when you're being hunted
           by a creature in a mask.
          Kylo Ren stops, considers her... then reaches up, unlatches
          and REMOVES HIS MASK. Rey reacts, stunned. It takes a moment
          before she regains her own mask of defiance.

                          KYLO REN
           Tell me about the droid.

                          REY
           (a nervous beat)
           He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
           and a thermal hyperscan vindicator --

                          KYLO REN
           He's carrying a section of a
           navigational chart. We have the
           rest, recovered from archives of the
           Empire. We need the last piece.
           And somehow, you convinced the droid
           to show it to you. You. A scavenger --
          Rey reacts -- afraid -- how does he know?

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           You know I can take whatever I want.
          Trepidation flashes across Rey's eyes. Kylo Ren moves closer,
          his hand rising toward her. She recoils, but has nowhere to
          go. Kylo Ren nearly TOUCHES HER FACE...
          THEY'RE BOTH SURPRISED: they react to a feeling that passes
          between them -- AN ENERGY THEY RECOGNIZE IN EACH OTHER.
          And then it's gone. Adversaries again. Rey can't move,
          quietly strains in agony, trying to resist Ren's probing.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           ... You're so lonely... so afraid to
           leave...
           (then, slight smile)
           At night, desperate to sleep... you
           imagine an ocean. I see it -- I see
           the island...
          Tears stream down her face as she resists. She tries to
          break free, but can't budge.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           And Han Solo. You feel like he's
           the father you never had. He would've
           disappointed you.

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          His hand still on her face, her eyes fierce through the agony:

                          REY
           -- Get out of my head --
          But this just makes Kylo lean closer.

                          KYLO REN
           I know you've seen the map. It's in
           there... and now you'll give it to
           me. Don't be afraid. I feel it
           too.
          Where her strength comes from, she doesn't know, but:

                          REY
           I'm not giving you anything.

                          KYLO REN
           We'll see.
          He peers into her eyes intensely. She meets his gaze --

          DESPITE THE PAIN SHE IS STRONG.
          On Ren's face as HIS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO MELT AWAY. He has
          slammed up against a barrier in her mind. He looks less
          certain by the moment as Rey seems to GROW IN STRENGTH. The
          FEROCITY of confrontation builds until it hits critical mass

          AND REY DOES THE UNTHINKABLE! SHE ENTERS HIS HEAD, AMAZED

          AT WHAT SHE IS SEEING!

                          REY
           ... You... you're afraid... that you
           will never be as strong as... Darth
           Vader!
          KYLO REN SUDDENLY WITHDRAWS HIS HAND, as if her face were
          FIRE HOT. TAKES A STEP BACK, CONFUSED, RATTLED. Rey's body
          is released, she breathes deeply, her powerful eyes still on
          Kylo Ren, who starts to leave.
          And we PRELAP:

           SNOKE (V.O.)
           This scavenger, resisted you?

          INT. STARKILLER PLANET - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren, mask off, stands before Snoke.

                          KYLO REN
           She's strong with the Force, untrained
           but, stronger than she knows.
          And while Ren's mind no doubt goes to Luke:

                          SNOKE
           And the droid?

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          Kylo Ren hesitates to reveal the truth. Then:

           GENERAL HUX (O.S.)
           Ren believed it was no longer valuable
           to us.
          Ren turns back -- Hux enters the large space, moves to the
          platform beside Ren.

           GENERAL HUX (CONT'D)
           That the girl was all we needed. As
           a result, the droid has most likely
           been returned to the hands of the
           enemy. They may have the map already.
          Snoke is visibly furious.

                          SNOKE
           Then the Resistance must be destroyed
           before they get to Skywalker.

                          GENERAL HUX
           We have their location. We tracked
           their reconnaissance ship to the
           Ileenium system.

                          SNOKE
           Good. Then we will crush them once
           and for all. Prepare the weapon.
          Kylo Ren is stunned by the moment -- that isn't what he meant
          at all --

                          KYLO REN
           Supreme Leader. I can get the map
           from the girl. I just need your
           guidance.

                          SNOKE
           If what you say about this girl is
           true, bring her to me.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - HOLDING CELL - DAY

          SLOW PUSH IN ON REY, shackled, mind still racing over what's
          happened between her and Kylo Ren. She is flooded with
          emotions, feeling her potential, her strength, that in this
          moment of being restrained, perhaps anything is possible.
          She turns to the Stormtrooper Guard. Studies him for an
          intense beat. Then says:

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.
          The Stormtrooper Guard looks at her. A beat.

           What did you say?
          Rey's eyes stay trained on him. She shifts in her seat, her
          confidence wavering, but she repeats, with authority:

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.
           And leave this cell, with the door
           open.
          The Stormtrooper Guard, rifle aimed, MOVES FOR HER.
          Rey's heart pounds -- is she about to be killed, freed, or
          laughed at? The tension unbearable when the Guard says:

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           I'll tighten those restraints,
           scavenger scum!

          Rey stares intently at the trooper. Calms herself. And
          tries again.

                          REY
           You will remove these restraints.

           I will remove these restraints. And
           leave this cell, with the door open.
          He reaches down and UNLATCHES THE RESTRAINTS. HE THEN TURNS
          AND STARTS TO HEAD OUT, her back to him as he exits. SHE IS
          IN SHOCK. Then tries, quickly:

                          REY
           And you will drop your weapon.

                          TROOPER GUARD #2
           And I'll drop my weapon.
          The Trooper Guard DROPS HIS WEAPON without turning back --
          Rey HEARS the gun fall. She's incredulous. The guard has

          LEFT THE CELL, ITS DOOR OPEN.

          WIDE ANGLE, empty corridor, toward the cell: we only HEAR

          of red hot DEBRIS BOUNCES into the corridor.
          Two STORMTROOPERS, crossing at the far end of the hall, STOP

          to the Starkiller Base planet.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Finn, now a member of the inner circle of the Resistance, is
          huddled with the group around the MAP TABLE, which displays
          a WIREFRAME HOLOGRAM of a ROLLING VIEW OF THE SURFACE OF
          STARKILLER BASE. With Finn are Han, Leia, Poe, C-3PO,
          Statura, Ackbar, Brance, SNAP, MAJOR EMATT (60), NIEN NUNB,
          and others. An urgent, messy strategy session --

                          POE
           The scan data from Snap's
           reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's
           report.

                          SNAP
           They've somehow created a hyper
           lightspeed weapon built within the
           planet itself.

                          BRANCE
           A laser cannon?

                          SNAP
           We're not sure how to describe a
           weapon of this scale.

                          MAJOR EMATT

                          (HORRIBLE MEMORIES)
           It's another Death Star.

                          POE
           I wish that were the case, Major.
          Poe hits a control. A WIREFRAME OF THE DEATH STAR APPEARS.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           This was the Death Star.
          Poe hits another control -- the Death Star SHRINKS -- AND
          SHRINKS AND SHRINKS, as the SURFACE AREA OF THE STARKILLER

          BASE IS DRAWN INTO A LARGER IMAGE, REVEALING THE ENTIRE BASE
          PLANET. The Death Star is a minuscule SATELLITE in
          comparison.

                          POE (CONT'D)
           This is Starkiller Base.
          This is news to many here, and they're stunned.

                          HAN
           So it's big.

                          ADMIRAL ACKBAR
           How is it possible to power a weapon
           of this size?

                          FINN
           It uses the power of the sun. As
           the weapon is charged, the sun is
           drained until it disappears.
          An OFFICER runs up, hands Leia a DATACARD.

                          LEIA
           (eyes on datacard)
           The First Order: they're charging
           the weapon again, now.
           (then, heart sinking)
           Our system is the next target.

                          C-3PO
           Oh my. Without the Republic fleet,
           we're doomed.
          They all react to this horrible news.

                          HAN
           Okay, how do we blow it up?
           (all eyes on him)
           There's always a way to do that.

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:
          But no one has anything. Leia watches the silence,
          frustrated. Finally, rallying them:

                          LEIA
           Han's right.
          Han is surprised.

                          ADMIRAL STATURA
           (at first hesitant)
           In order for that amount of power to
           be contained, that base would need
           some kind of thermal oscillator...

                          FINN
           There is one.
          All eyes on Finn as he moves around the hologram to a location
          on the Starkiller Base -- it is ZOOMED IN: A GIANT BLACK

          HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE.

                          FINN (CONT'D)
           Precinct 47. Here.

                          ADMIRAL STATURA

                          (HYPOTHESIZING)
           If we can destroy that oscillator,
           it might de-stabilize the core and
           cripple the weapon.

                          MAJOR EMATT
           ... Maybe the planet.
          Poe then tries to bolster spirits, looking at the BIG
          HEXAGONAL STRUCTURE: the Oscillator.

                          POE
           We'll go in there and we'll hit that
           oscillator with everything we got.

                          ADMIRAL ACKBAR
           They have defensive shields that our
           ships cannot penetrate.

                          HAN
           We disable the shields.

                          (TO FINN)
           Kid, you worked there, what do you
           got?

                          FINN
           (beat, then:)
           I can do it.

                          HAN
           I like this guy.

                         

                         

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

                          FINN
           I can disable the shields. But I
           have to be there, on the planet--

                          HAN
           We'll get you there.

                          LEIA
           Han, how?

                          HAN
           If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

                          POE
           So we disable the shields, take out
           the oscillator and we blow up their
           big gun. All right. Let's go!
          And everyone splits.

          EXT. HANGARS, RESISTANCE BASE - DAY


          SERIES OF SHOTS: THE RESISTANCE FLEET PREPARES FOR ITS
          MISSION. Pilots inspect crafts, including Snap, Nien Nunb,
          and Poe at his black-marked X-wing. Mechanics make
          adjustments as Crews fuel the jets. Ground controllers move
          ships into takeoff formation. Pilots prep their ships,
          including BB-8, who is PULLED INTO Poe's black X-wing.
          Finn approaches Poe wearing the jacket.
          Poe slaps Finn's shoulder as he heads off. Finn watches
          Poe, despite it all, a little laugh. Over this:

          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Chewie and Finn follow Han's orders as they prepare the Falcon
          for one more daring run, maybe its last:

                          HAN
           Chewie, check that donal capitator.
           Come on. Let's go. -- Finn, be
           careful with those - they're
           explosives.

                          FINN
           Now you tell me?

                          LEIA
           No matter how much we fought, I've
           always hated watching you leave.
          Han looks over, there's Leia.

                          HAN
           That's what I did it. So you'd miss
           me.
          She laughs, moves up close to him.

          He looks at her, says sweetly, out of the blue:

                          HAN
           It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh?
           Some of it was...good.

                          LEIA
           ... Pretty good.

                          (SMILES)
           True. You still drive me crazy.
          Han places his hands on her shoulders. It could be thirty
          years ago.
          They both know there's a good chance he won't make it back.
          They pull each other tight, holding for dear life. Quietly,

                         LONGINGLY:

                          LEIA (CONT'D)

           Their shields have a fractional
           refresh rate. Keeps anything
           traveling slower than lightspeed
           from getting through.
          Finn is suddenly filled with dread.

           We're gonna make our landing approach

                          FINN
           Not anymore. The name's Finn, and
           I'm in charge. I'm in charge now,
           Phasma. I'm in charge.

                          HAN
           Bring it down. Bring it down.

                          FINN
           Follow me.
          Finn SMILES as we CUT TO:

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

          TIGHT ON REY'S FACE as she peers nervously around a corner.
          Rey runs down a long, glossy hall, taking cover in an alcove,
          the Trooper Guard's rifle HELD TIGHT.
          From this alcove, she can see down another LONG, PERPENDICULAR
          WALKWAY -- on one side, a STONE AND STEEL WALL. On the other
          side, a VAST ATRIUM, with a railing-free DROP OFF, the white
          pill-light design descending HUNDREDS OF FEET.
          At the end of this walkway is an OPEN HANGAR DOOR, revealing
          HUNDREDS OF TIE FIGHTERS parked outside.
          TIGHT on Rey's face as her plan is clear. But the problem:
          between her and the ship she wants to steal, is a GROUP OF
          STORMTROOPERS. Guards, in conversation.
          As she tries to think about what to do next, we see, FAR
          BEHIND HER in the perpendicular hall, ANOTHER GROUP OF STORM-
          and SNOWTROOPERS headed her way!
          Rey's mind races -- another peek out and she RUNS FAST, across
          the walkway, and CLIMBS DOWN -- her fingertips disappearing
          over the edge just as the Troopers approach and continue.
          WIDE SHOT as Rey holds on carefully as the guards walk off,
          not seeing her over the edge, a death drop below her.
          But then she SEES SOMETHING and has a brainstorm. She
          strenuously cross-climbs to an invisible SERVICE HATCH, which
          She opens, and climbs INSIDE THE WALL, closing the hatch
          behind her.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - INSIDE THE WALLS - DAY

          A REMARKABLE IMAGE, inside the inner workings of the base.
          Tiny by comparison, Rey climbs amid the incredible
          infrastructure, a drop to infinity beneath her. She is
          between the LIGHT SOURCE and the WHITE PILL SHAPES, as she
          makes her way ACROSS.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ATRIUM AREA - DAY

          WIDE SHOT of the Stormtrooper GUARDS, above the drop off
          into the atrium. What they cannot see is a SHADOWED
          SILHOUETTE OF REY against the ENDLESS WHITE PILL LIGHTS as
          she climbs across the space, beneath them, toward her exit!

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ACCESS POINT - DAY

          CLOSE AS PHASMA SITS INTO FRAME in front of a WORKSTATION --
          Finn, Han and Chewie, blasters aimed. Phasma reluctantly
          works controls on the workstation.

                          FINN
           You want me to blast that bucket off
           your head? Lower the shields.

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           You're making a big mistake.

                          FINN
           Do it.
          Chewie MOAN/TALKS. Phasma hits a few more buttons -- the
          controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLE INITIATE". Eyes on

                         THE WORKSTATION:

           Solo, if this works, we're not going
           to have a lot of time to find Rey.

                          HAN
           Don't worry kid, we won't leave here
           without her.
          The controls BEEP-CLICK. "SHIELDS DISABLED".

                          CAPTAIN PHASMA
           (to Finn, cruel)
           You can't be so stupid as to think
           this will be easy. My troops will
           storm this block and kill you all.

                          FINN
           I disagree. What do we do with her?

                          HAN
           Is there a garbage chute? Trash
           compactor?

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The Stormtroopers move up the ramp, weapons ready, checking
          carefully where blind corners intersect from the perimeter.
          They come round to the next higher level and PASS CLOSE TO
          CAMERA. When they've passed, TILT to find CHEWIE, in the
          shadows of the grillwork.

          Once they're gone, he plants another charge.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NEAR DARKNESS

          The Snowspeeder comes to a stop outside the structure. Finn
          and Rey stop for a moment, look to the sky: THE SUN IS NEARLY

          GONE.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT

          Han finishes setting a charge and is about to move on when
          he HEARS SOMETHING and conceals himself behind a wide,
          vertical support. He peaks around the edge and his whole
          demeanor changes --
          HAN'S POV: Kylo Ren appears and stops at the railing, looking
          down into the filter.
          Han looks at his son with a tortured storm of feelings.
          WE'RE WITH KYLO REN as he resumes his hunt. He heads directly
          toward WHERE HAN IS HIDING! Kylo Ren has an INCREASING SENSE
          OF HAN'S PRESENCE as he moves closer. He comes to where Han
          was hiding -- but HAN IS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.
          From his hiding place in a narrow, POWER CHAMBER in the wall,

          HAN WATCHES HIS SON PASS ONLY A FEW FEET IN FRONT OF HIM.
          Han SHIFTS HIS POSITION in the tight compartment, so he can
          watch Ren's progress. Kylo Ren turns onto a FLAT BRIDGE
          THAT BISECTS the open space.
          Unaware of his father, Kylo Ren walks purposefully across to
          the opposite side. Han watches his son walk off -- the CLANK-
          CLANK of Kylo Ren's boots receding.
          This is Han's opportunity to escape but Leia's words echo
          through his mind. He makes a decision and moves out, to the
          edge of the catwalk. He calls out, strongly:

                          HAN
           Ben!
          The name ECHOES as Kylo Ren STOPS, far across the vast
          catwalk. He turns.

                          KYLO REN
           Han Solo. I've been waiting for
           this day for a long time.
          Finn and Rey make their way into the space, opening a HATCH
          that allows A BEAM OF PRECIOUS SUNLIGHT to stream down like
          a spotlight on Han and his son. Finn and Rey get to a railing
          and look down. They can SEE and HEAR Han and Kylo Ren on
          the catwalk below.

                         CONTINUED:

                          HAN
           Take off that mask. You don't need
           it.

                          KYLO REN
           What do you think you'll see if I
           do?
          Han moves toward Kylo Ren.

                          HAN
           The face of my son.
          Kylo TAKES OFF HIS MASK. Han is JOLTED -- seeing the face
          of his son for the first time as a man.

                          KYLO REN
           Your son is gone. He was weak and
           foolish, like his father. So I
           destroyed him.

                          HAN
           That's what Snoke wants you to believe
           but it's not true. My son is alive.
          SEVERAL LEVELS BELOW them, CHEWIE comes to the rail to watch.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - LOWER LEVEL - NEAR DARKNESS

          Kylo flares.

                          KYLO REN
           No. The Supreme Leader is wise.
          UP ABOVE, Finn, Chewie and Rey watch, rapt. Stormtroopers
          dot the perimeter of the structure, watching the scene.
          ON THE BRIDGE, Han moves closer, stern:

                          HAN
           Snoke is using you for your power.
           When he gets what he wants, he'll
           crush you -- you know it's true.
          Kylo hesitates. Somehow, he does know it.

                          KYLO REN
           It's too late.

                          HAN
           No it's not. Leave here with me.
           Come home. We miss you.
          For the first time, Kylo Ren seems truly conflicted. Tears
          flood his stoic eyes...

                          KYLO REN
           I'm being torn apart. I want to be
           free of this pain.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - DARKNESS FALLS

          Han takes one step toward his son, but stops himself.

                          KYLO REN
           I know what I have to do, but I don't
           know if I have the strength to do
           it. Will you help me?
          Han hears his son's voice again, pained and vulnerable.

                          HAN
           Yes. Anything.
          Kylo Ren unholsters his lightsaber and SLOWLY EXTENDS IT to
          Han, within a foot of Han's chest. Han almost can't believe
          it. The moment seems to last forever. And just then, the
          LAST BEAM OF SUNLIGHT streaming through the open hatch

          VANISHES.
          Han actually smiles -- and reaches out for the dark weapon --
          but with the light now gone, KYLO REN'S EYES FILL WITH

          DARKNESS, HE IGNITES THE LIGHTSABER -- THE FIERY BLADE SHOOTS

          OUT, RIGHT THROUGH HAN'S CHEST AND BACK!

                          KYLO REN
           Thank you.
          ABOVE, Finn and Rey GASP -- SCREAM --

                          FINN

                          (PANTING)

                          (ALSO PANTING)
           No, no.
          Han's last moment is looking into his son's face. HAN'S
          KNEES BUCKLE. The blade tilts down with him... until KYLO
          REN EXTINGUISHES IT AND HAN HOLDS onto the catwalk -- his
          life slipping away.
          Finally Han FALLS BACK, OFF THE CATWALK, INTO THE DEPTHS OF

          THE STRUCTURE!

          Leia, feeling it instantly -- knowing -- drops into a seat,

          DEVASTATED.

          INT. OSCILLATOR STRUCTURE - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren is somehow WEAKENED by this wicked act. Himself
          horrified. His SHOCK is broken only when --
          CHEWIE CRIES OUT IN AGONY! Chewie furiously FIRES AT KYLO
          REN, HITTING HIM IN THE SIDE! Kylo Ren falls back, stunned.

          Our MUSIC TAKES OVER, EPIC AND HEARTBREAKING as Stormtroopers
          FIRE AT CHEWIE, who is forced to retreat down a corridor,
          where he holds the EXPLOSIVE REMOTE -- he PUSHES THE BUTTON!
          Hearing ONLY OUR SCORE, FIRST ONE, then TWO, then FOUR, then
          SIX EXPLOSIONS rock the structure -- CATWALKS FALL as the
          walls CAVE IN!
          Kylo Ren SEES REY AND FINN, WATCHING THE EXPLOSIONS IN SHOCK --
          then they SEE KYLO REN, WHO RECOGNIZES THEM BOTH, WITH
          ASTONISHMENT. He rises to his full height and heads for
          them with long strides.
          Stormtroopers begin to BLAST AWAY AT REY AND FINN! CRAZED,

          REY FIRES BACK AS BLASTS HIT AROUND HER. FINN WRAPS AN ARM

          AROUND HER AND DRAGS/CARRIES HER OUT OF SIGHT!

           Admiral, their weapon will fire in
           two minutes.

          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

          From a distance the oscillator is ablaze and fractured from
          the explosives. Then Rey and Finn appear, coming over a
          rising, running into a bare-tree snowy forest.

                          FINN
           The Falcon's this way.
          Finn and Rey, overcome with emotion, race through the snowy
          forest -- until Finn SLOWS AND STOPS. Rey stops too, both
          out of breath. They look at each other. They both know:
          they can't run.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - FOREST - NIGHT

          Kylo Ren moves through the trees -- until he STOPS. Takes
          out the saber, ignites it.
          A still figure amidst the gusts of wind and snow.

          STANDING THIRTY FEET AWAY, FACING HIM, ARE FINN AND REY.
          Finn holds LUKE'S LIGHTSABER, Rey the Stormtrooper BLASTER.

                          KYLO REN
           We're not done yet.

           It's just us now. Han Solo can't
           save you.
          After a beat, Rey moves forward with the blaster -- AIMS IT!
          Kylo Ren RAISES A HAND -- Rey struggles under his FORCE POWER --
          she can't fire -- he strains too, especially with the WOUND
          Chewie inflicted. Kylo Ren GESTURES POWERFULLY -- Rey's
          BLASTER FLIES OUT OF HER HAND -- another GESTURE and Rey
          FLIES BACK and SLAMS INTO A TREE thirty feet away!
          She drops -- LANDS HARD in the snow. Dazed, hurt.

                          FINN
           Rey! Rey! Rey... Rey... Oh no. Oh
           no no no...
          Finn turns to her, afraid and concerned. But the SOUND OF
          KYLO REN'S LIGHTSABER moving makes Finn TURN BACK TO KYLO
          REN, lit by the glowing YELLOW AND RED BLADE.

                          KYLO REN

           TRAITOR!
          In reply, Finn TURNS ON LUKE'S LIGHTSABER -- upon seeing the
          weapon, Kylo Ren REACTS IN SHOCK.

           KYLO REN (CONT'D)
           That lightsaber. It belongs to me!

                          FINN
           Come get it.
          Despite his fear, Finn raises his blade in welcome. Kylo
          Ren CHARGES at him - Finn terrified -- Kylo Ren LUNGES but
          Finn DEFLECTS Ren's SPARK-SPITTING blade!
          Kylo Ren TURNS, ATTACKS, CUTS -- amazingly Finn BLOCKS,
          COUNTER-ATTACKS -- clearly IMPRESSES KYLO REN, who only enjoys
          this challenge more!
          Rey RECOVERS, gets her bearings. Her eyes focus on the two
          men fighting, through the trees.
          Kylo Ren is obviously hampered by his wound, yet he attacks
          with a primal SAVAGERY -- Finn BLOCKS, turning DEFENSIVE
          moves into OFFENSIVE ones. And he ACTUALLY GETS A HIT IN!
          LUKE'S SABER GRAZING KYLO REN'S ARM! Kylo MOVES BACK --
          wounded, but more enraged than weakened. Kylo Ren CHARGES
          AGAIN -- their WEAPONS POUND, SPARKS FLY, their blades LOCK,
          the men are CLOSE, LIT BY the powerful, CRASHING sabers:
          And Kylo Ren PUSHES FINN BACK, attacks with pure ferocity --
          Finn is stunned -- unprepared for this fierceness.
          Rey sees this -- Kylo Ren unleashes a MERCILESS SERIES OF
          BLOWS, pushing Finn further and further back until he loses
          balance.

          That's when KYLO REN STRIKES: HE LANDS A BLOW TO FINN'S TORSO --

          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER FLIES FROM FINN'S HAND, THROWN TWENTY FEET!
          Kylo Ren TURNS OFF HIS LIGHTSABER and REACHES FOR LUKE'S

          LIGHTSABER -- BECKONING IT WITH THE FORCE.

          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER VIBRATES IN THE SNOW.
          Kylo Ren GESTURES, INCREASES HIS POWER -- LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

          FINALLY FLIES OUT OF THE SNOW, BULLETS TOWARD KYLO REN --

          -- AND SPEEDS PAST HIM!

          KYLO REN TURNS TO SEE LUKE'S LIGHTSABER LAND IN THE HAND OF

          REY, WHO STANDS, FACING HIM, HAVING REACHED FOR IT HERSELF,

          BUT UTTERLY STUNNED THAT IT LANDED IN HER HAND! SHE IS

          SHOCKED -- AND SO IS KYLO REN!
          Holding it with both hands, SHE IGNITES LUKE'S LIGHTSABER

          FOR THE FIRST TIME, HER EYES BLAZING.
          Kylo Ren IGNITES HIS SABER.
          It's REY who charges now -- Kylo Ren immediately on the
          defensive. They BATTLE POWERFULLY -- He is clearly rocked
          by her raw, innate skill.

          Another two X-wings -- including Poe's -- soar through the

          Outside, the SUN ALMOST COMPLETELY GONE -- PULL BACK THROUGH

          Poe's X-wing weaves through the breach. A pursuing TIE
          fighter does not clear the gap, leaving Poe to circle the
          interior of the unguarded structure, firing volley after
          volley of torpedoes.

          EXT. STARKILLER BASE - OSCILLATOR - NIGHT

          The remaining X-Wings -- including Poe's -- BLAST the place --

          Amid the BARE WHITE TREES, ONLY TWO LIGHTSABERS -- LUKE'S

          as Rey and Kylo Ren BATTLE HARD.
          She seems to be, impossibly, STRONGER THAN HE IS for half a
          dozen blows -- until he FINDS HIS STRENGTH and FIGHTS BACK --
          MOVING FORWARD and PUSHING REY BACK, into the forest.
          Suddenly a COLOSSAL CHUNK OF THE FOREST RIGHT BEHIND REY
          DROPS AWAY! Rey is suddenly fighting on the EDGE OF A

          MASSIVE, BRAND NEW CLIFF!

                          KYLO REN
           You need a teacher! I can show you
           the ways of the Force!

                          REY
           The Force.
          Rey closes her eyes for a long beat. When Rey opens them,
          she is centered, fortified, and she POUNDS BACK, SINGLE HANDED
          SWIPES, hitting Ren's gnarly, spitting saber with incredible
          FORCE. It's so fast now, so furious, that Kylo Ren FALLS
          BACK -- She ATTACKS HARDER!
          Ren gets up again but she HITS HIS SABER'S HILT -- HIS BLADE
          GOES FLYING OFF, TUMBLING INTO THE SNOW -- and she SLASHES

          AGAIN AND AGAIN AND HITS KYLO REN SQUARE IN THE HEAD AND

          CHEST. HE GOES DOWN, SUDDENLY A FEARFUL MAN, A LARGE BURN
          SCAR SLASHED ACROSS HIS FACE! He still reaches for his saber.
          And she could kill him -- right now, with ONE VICIOUS STRIKE!
          But she stops. Realizing she stands on a greater edge than
          even the cliff -- the edge of the dark side. The earth
          SHAKES. The earth splits. A gully forms.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT

          The area where the RALLY was held is now COLLAPSING into a
          giant sink hole! We WHIP PAN to a YOUNG TECHNICIAN, who
          watches this out the control room window in horror. He
          hurries off, passing COLONEL DATOO, who admonishes:

                          COLONEL DATOO
           Lieutenant, get back to your station!

                          YOUNG TECHNICIAN
           (stops, fleetingly)
           Just look. We won't survive -- even
           Hux has gone!
          As he hurries off, WE HEAR:

           GENERAL HUX (V.O.)
           Supreme Leader.

          INT. STARKILLER BASE - ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT

          Hux stands before SNOKE'S IMAGE. Relative quiet here, but
          distant SOUNDS OF DESTRUCTION. Hux tries to keep it together
          but is horrified, heartsick:

                          GENERAL HUX
           The fuel cells have ruptured. The
           collapse of the planet has begun.
          Snoke takes this in. Furious, desolate... knowing.

                          SNOKE
           Leave the base at once and come to
           me with Kylo Ren.

                          (GRIM)
           It is time to complete his training.

          EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

          Rey turns, runs a hundred feet through the forest to:
          FINN, who lies, near death, not far from where the GROUND
          FELL AWAY. Rey falls to her knees near him, turns him over,
          sees his cauterized but possibly fatal wound.

                          REY
           Finn! Finn...
          Tears come to her eyes as she lifts him, holds his lifeless
          body in her arms. Snow flurries around them as she cries,
          holding this boy who she just met, who she already adores.
          They are left here to die -- nearby MORE TREES DROP as the
          planet continues to COLLAPSE. And just as it seems like all
          is lost... Her wet eyes look up to see:

          LIGHTS RISE FROM THE NEWLY-FORMED CANYON -- IT'S A SHIP WE
          KNOW -- IT'S THE MILLENNIUM FALCON -- and its lights

          ILLUMINATE REY, WHOSE FACE FILLS WITH HOPE!
          CHEWIE IS AT THE CONTROLS. He ROARS to them!

          EXT. FALCON - NIGHT

          Chewie exits the ship.
          MOMENTS LATER Chewie CARRIES FINN up the ramp. Rey hurries
          with them back into the ship --

          INT. FALCON - NIGHT

          Chewie carries Finn inside, followed by Rey.

          EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

          And we FLY WITH THE FALCON as it leaves the planet -- we can
          see CHEWIE AND REY PILOTING, the COLLAPSING PLANET BEHIND
          US. The Resistance X-wings, led by Poe, follow the Falcon.

          INT. X-WING - NIGHT


                          POE
           All teams! I got eyes on them!

                          SNAP
           Yes!
          The X-wings ROAR OFF, skyward as the MUSIC SOARS, the PLANET
          IMPLODES -- THE SUNLIGHT IT CONTAINS BURSTS FORTH, and as we
          get further and further distance from what was Starkiller
          Base, we witness the REBIRTH OF A SUN. Light restored to a
          corner of the galaxy.
          The Millennium Falcon and the X-wings RIP THROUGH SPACE,
          headed home.

                          POE
           Our job's done here. Let's go home!

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          ESTABLISHING SHOT as the Falcon on the landing strip.

          EXT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          The Falcon has landed among the remaining Resistance ships.
          Poe is there, watching as Chewie scuttles down the ramp
          carrying an unconscious Finn. Medical Personnel and Officers,
          meet them, usher them inside.

                          MEDIC
           Easy, easy. He's hurt. We've got a
           heartbeat.
          Rey walks down the ramp and sees, for the first time, Leia.
          C-3PO and BB-8 behind her. The crowds are cheering.
          Rey is so sad for Leia, so sorry.
          The two women move for each other. And Leia takes Rey's
          face in her hands. Despite her heartbreak, she is grateful.
          She embraces Rey. A mother's embrace.
          Rey cries, too, in this emotional first meeting.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Chewbacca sits quietly, as do many in the base, mourning
          their losses.
          As BB-8 approaches R2-D2, the long dormant droid suddenly
          stirs. The droids beep at each other.

                          C-3PO
           R2-D2! You've come back! You found
           what? How dare you call me that!

                          (MORE)

                         

                         

                          (CONTINUED)

                         CONTINUED:

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           (he swats R2-D2, who

                          CONTINUES BEEPING)
           Find Master Luke how? Come, R2! We
           must go tell the others at once!

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - DAY

          Leia stands alone and in silence, heartbroken.

           C-3PO (O.S.)
           General? Excuse me, General?
          Leia turns to see droids.

           C-3PO (CONT'D)
           R2-D2 may contain some much needed
           good news.

                          LEIA
           Tell me.
          Rey stands with Leia, Poe C-3PO, BB-8 and a handful of
          Resistance Officers. Suddenly R2-D2 PROJECTS A HOLOGRAM! A

          LARGE NAVIGATIONAL MAP WITH A SPECIFIC MISSING CHUNK!
          BB-8 BEEPS -- Poe turns to him --

                          POE
           Yeah, all right, buddy, hold on --
          Poe runs over -- removes the ancient data device that Lor
          San Tekka had given him from a base computer. He inserts it
          back inside BB-8, who then PROJECTS HIS MAP -- which he
          SHRINKS DOWN TO SIZE -- and the two droids MOVE SLIGHTLY --

          TOGETHER -- THE TWO HOLOGRAMS UNITE, BB-8'S PIECE FILLING IN

          R2-D2'S PERFECTLY!
          Everyone REACTS -- amazed --

                          C-3PO
           Oh! The map! It is complete!

                          LEIA
           (hand on her heart)
           -- Luke --
          Suddenly there are CHEERS AND EMBRACES.
          C-3PO leans down to R2-D2 and says, quietly, sweetly:

                          C-3PO
           (to R2-D2)
           Oh my dear friend. How I've missed
           you.

          INT. RESISTANCE BASE - I.C.U. - DAY

          A NEW DAY. Finn, unconscious in an I.C.U. POD. His fate
          uncertain. Rey sits with him. Deeply worried. Finally she
          leans in, close to him. She kisses him and says, quietly,
          despite her fear:

                          REY
           We'll see each other again. I believe
           that. Thank you, my friend.

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          Chewie does last minute checks of the Falcon. Rey stands
          with Leia a beat and then turns to head to the Falcon. As
          Rey walks off, she hears Leia call out:

                          LEIA
           Rey.
          Rey turns around.

                          LEIA (CONT'D)
           May the Force be with you.
          This fills Rey up. She smiles gratefully. Rey crosses to
          the Falcon.

          INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY

          Rey sits in the pilot seat, Chewie as co-pilot. Rey looks
          at him compassionately.
          Rey FLICKS SWITCHES and --

          EXT. D'QAR - DAY

          The Millennium Falcon RISES.
          Leia, with Poe, BB-8, and C-3PO (with his proper arm
          replaced), watches the next generation of Jedi begin her
          journey.

          EXT. SPACE - DAY

          The Falcon FLIES through space and BLASTS to LIGHTSPEED.

          EXT. AHCH-TO - DAY

          A pristine and mighty OCEAN. Endless BLUE, dotted with
          random, beautiful, mountainous BLACK ROCK ISLANDS, dotted
          with countless GREEN TREES.
          The Millennium Falcon FLIES INTO VIEW, BANKS toward one of
          the ISLANDS.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - DAY

          Rey, her staff strapped to her back, begins her hike up the
          considerable mountain, glancing back at Chewie and R2-D2,
          who watch her from the bottom of the ramp. A deep breath
          and Rey continues her journey.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STAIRS - DAY

          Built within the rock and foliage of this idyllic island are
          seemingly endless ANCIENT STONE STEPS. Rey continues to
          climb them, determined, despite her fatigue.

          EXT. AHCH-TO ISLAND - STONE STRUCTURES - DAY

          Rey arrives at a clearing. Small, modest, primitive stone
          structures. But no one around. Rey walks past them, sees,
          senses no one.

          And then she stops. Feels something. She turns.
          Standing forty feet away from her, his back to us, is a MAN,
          in a CLOAK AND ROBE.

          Rey stares, knowing exactly who it is. But she just stares
          for what seems like forever. Until he finally TURNS, SLOWLY,
          to her. Pulls back his hood.

          IT IS LUKE SKYWALKER.

          Older now, white hair, bearded. He looks at Rey. A kindness
          in his eyes, but there's something tortured, too. He doesn't
          need to ask her who she is, or what she is doing here. His
          look says it all.

          In response, Rey pulls something from the pack.

          LUKE'S LIGHTSABER.
          And she holds it out to him. An offer. A plea. The galaxy's
          only hope.

          HOLD ON LUKE SKYWALKER'S INCREDIBLE FACE, amazed and
          conflicted at what he sees, as our MUSIC BUILDS, the promise
          of an adventure, just beginning...

                         

                         

                          THE END

Episode VIII
THE LAST JEDI

The FIRST ORDER reigns.
Having decimated the peaceful
Republic, Supreme Leader Snoke
now deploys the merciless
legions to seize military
control of the galaxy.

Only General Leia Organa's
band of RESISTANCE fighters
stand against the rising
tyranny, certain that Jedi
Master Luke Skywalker will
return and restore a spark of
hope to the fight.

But the Resistance has been
exposed. As the First Order
speeds toward the rebel base,
the brave heroes mount a
desperate escape....

1
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,207
We're not clear yet.

2
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,840
There are still 30 pallets
of cannon shells in C bunker.

3
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,760
Forget the munitions, there's no time.
Just get everyone on the transports.

4
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,082
Oh, no.

5
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,287
We've caught them in the middle
of their evacuation.

6
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,648
I have my orders from
Supreme Leader Snoke himself.

7
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,481
This is where we snuff out
the Resistance once and for all.

8
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,691
Tell Captain Canady to prime his dreadnought.

9
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,370
Incinerate their base, destroy their
transports and obliterate their fleet.

10
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,768
General, Resistance ship approaching.
Guns and shields in attack mode.

11
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,201
A single light fighter.

12
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,041
Happy beeps here, buddy, come on.

13
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,281
We've pulled crazier stunts than this.

14
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:26,125
Just for the record, Commander Dameron,
I'm with the droid on this one.

15
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,169
Thank you for your support, General.

16
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,480
Happy beeps.

17
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
Attention.

18
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,529
This is Commander Poe Dameron
of the Republic fleet,

19
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,684
I have an urgent communiqué for General Hugs.

20
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,205
Patch him through.

21
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,046
This is General Hux of the First Order.

22
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,523
The Republic is no more.

23
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,923
Your fleet are Rebel scum and war criminals.

24
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,566
Tell your precious princess
there will be no terms,

25
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,246
there will be no surrender.

26
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,443
Hi, I'm holding for General Hugs.

27
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,570
This is Hux. You and your friends are doomed.

28
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,809
We will wipe your filth from the galaxy.

29
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,768
Okay. I'll hold.

30
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,441
Hello?

31
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,326
Hello? Yup. I'm still here.

32
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,810
Can he hear me?

33
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,200
- Hugs?
- He can.

34
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,603
With an "H." Skinny guy. Kinda pasty.

35
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,089
I can hear you. Can you hear me?

36
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,805
Look, I can't hold forever. If you reach him,

37
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,164
tell him Leia has
an urgent message for him...

38
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,607
I believe he's tooling with you, sir.

39
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,524
...about his mother.

40
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
Open fire!

41
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,040
BB-8, punch it!

42
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,320
He's going for the dreadnought.

43
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,401
Ha!

44
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,127
He's insane.

45
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,249
Woo-hoo! That's got a kick.

46
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,400
All right, taking out the cannons now.

47
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,560
Tallie, start your approach.

48
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,687
Copy that.

49
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,250
Captain Canady,
why aren't you blasting that puny ship?

50
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,211
That puny ship is too small
and at too close range.

51
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,725
We need to scramble our fighters

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,930
five bloody minutes ago.

53
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,286
He'll never penetrate our armor.

54
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,249
He's not trying to penetrate our armor.

55
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,408
He's clearing out our surface cannons.

56
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,000
One cannon left.

57
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,491
And here comes the parade.

58
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,121
Yeah! Yeah, I see him!

59
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,440
No, no, no. Damn it!

60
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,851
BB-8, my weapons systems are down.

61
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,401
We gotta take out that last cannon
or our bombers are toast.

62
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,880
Work your magic, buddy.

63
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,965
Are the auto-cannons primed?

64
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,121
Primed and ready, sir.

65
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,486
What are we waiting for?

66
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,927
Fire on the base!

67
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,521
Punch it!

68
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,008
The last transport is in the air.
The evacuation is complete.

69
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,240
You did it, Poe.

70
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,640
Now get your squad back here
so we can get out of this place.

71
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,800
No, General...

72
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,450
We can do this. We have the chance

73
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,681
to take out a dreadnought.

74
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,324
These things are fleet killers.

75
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,480
We can't let it get away.

76
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,766
Disengage now...

77
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,730
Commander. That is an or...

78
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,643
Wipe that nervous expression
off your face, Threepio.

79
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:01,845
Oh. Well, I will certainly try, General.

80
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,161
Nervous?

81
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,325
Let's go, BB-8.

82
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,600
It's now or never!

83
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,408
Yes!

84
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,040
All clear! Bring the bombs.

85
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:39,121
Captain,

86
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,569
Resistance bombers approaching.

87
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,041
Of course they are.

88
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,485
Bombers, keep that tight formation.

89
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:59,688
Fighters, protect the bombers.

90
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,447
It's not every day we get a shot at
a dreadnought, so let's make this count.

91
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,607
Copy that, Blue Leader.

92
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,649
You get us there, we'll give it to them.

93
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,450
- Copy. We're on it.
- Fighters incoming.

94
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,405
Gunners, look alive.

95
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,680
Snubfighters at two-ten!

96
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,840
- They're coming in!
- Form up!

97
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,331
They're everywhere!

98
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,800
- Here they come.
- Incoming fighters. Form up.

99
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,240
Vector in at attack speed.

100
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,050
- Pull up!
- Flank right.

101
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,886
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! We're going down!

102
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,442
Recharge the auto-cannons.

103
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,610
Target their cruiser.

104
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,322
I see it. Tallie, they've targeted the fleet

105
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,130
and begun the priming sequence.

106
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,327
Copy that.

107
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,481
We're almost there.

108
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,964
Bombardiers, begin your drop sequence.

109
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,004
I've got a visual on the target.

110
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,606
We're approaching the sweet spot.

111
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,205
Bombs are armed.

112
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,166
- Auto-cannons aimed.
- Forty seconds to full charge.

113
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,687
Destroy that last bomber!

114
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,485
Paige, come in. We're over the target.

115
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,807
Why aren't your bay doors open?

116
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,247
You're the only bomber left.
It's all down to you!

117
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,971
- Nix!
- Paige!

118
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,963
Drop the payload now!

119
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,321
Look out!

120
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,360
No!

121
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,361
Bombs away!

122
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,000
Direct hit! Dreadnought down!

123
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,248
General, Supreme Leader Snoke
is making contact from his ship.

124
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:21,801
Excellent.

125
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,571
I'll take it in my chambers.

126
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,760
General Hux.

127
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:31,840
Ah, good. Supreme Lea...

128
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,920
My disappointment

129
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,528
in your performance cannot be overstated.

130
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,842
They can't get away, Supreme Leader.

131
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,208
We have them tied on the end of a string.

132
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,367
Rey!

133
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,400
Well done, pal.

134
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,203
"Finn naked leaking bag"?
What? Did you fry a chip?

135
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,290
Finn! Finn, buddy.

136
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,525
It's so good to see you.

137
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,727
What? Let's...

138
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,969
We need to get you dressed. Come on.

139
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,360
You must have a thousand questions.

140
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,806
Where's Rey?

141
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,410
Master Skywalker?

142
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,283
Master Skywalker?

143
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,570
I'm from the Resistance.

144
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,610
Your sister Leia sent me. We need your help.

145
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,044
Hello?

146
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,851
Go away.

147
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,131
Chewie, what are you doing here?

148
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,245
He said you're coming back with us.

149
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,401
How did you find me?

150
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,244
Long story. We'll tell you on the Falcon.

151
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,805
Falcon?

152
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,811
Wait.

153
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,043
Where's Han?

154
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,966
Tied on a string indeed,
General Hux. Well done.

155
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,329
The Resistance will soon be in our grasp.

156
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,727
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

157
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,130
You wonder why I keep a rabid cur

158
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,642
in such a place of power?

159
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,566
A cur's weakness, properly manipulated,

160
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,441
can be a sharp tool.

161
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,284
How's your wound?

162
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,641
It's nothing.

163
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,401
Hmm.

164
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,721
The mighty Kylo Ren.

165
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,290
When I found you,

166
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:26,051
I saw what all masters live to see.

167
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,091
Raw, untamed power.

168
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,690
And beyond that, something truly special.

169
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,966
The potential of your bloodline.

170
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,329
A new Vader.

171
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,566
Now I fear

172
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,891
I was mistaken.

173
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,646
I've given everything I have to you.

174
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,011
To the dark side.

175
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,084
Take that ridiculous thing off.

176
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,046
Yes, there it is.

177
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,880
You have too much
of your father's heart in you,

178
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,007
young Solo.

179
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,804
I killed Han Solo.

180
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,889
When the moment came, I didn't hesitate.

181
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,600
And look at you,

182
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,002
the deed split your spirit to the bone.

183
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,640
You were unbalanced,

184
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,527
bested by a girl
who had never held a lightsaber!

185
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,960
You failed!

186
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,571
Skywalker lives.

187
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,482
The seed of the Jedi Order lives.

188
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,529
And as long as it does,

189
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,002
hope lives in the galaxy.

190
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,445
I thought you would be the one
to snuff it out.

191
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,689
Alas, you're no Vader.

192
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,366
You're just a child

193
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,487
in a mask.

194
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,327
Prepare my ship.

195
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,044
There's no light left in Kylo Ren.

196
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,604
He's only getting stronger.

197
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,521
The First Order will control
all the major systems within weeks.

198
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,688
We need your help.

199
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,446
We need the Jedi Order back.

200
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,207
We need Luke Skywalker.

201
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,765
You don't need Luke Skywalker.

202
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,920
Did you hear a word I just said?

203
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,001
You think what?

204
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:29,808
I'm gonna walk out with a laser sword
and face down the whole First Order?

205
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,640
What did you think was going to happen here?

206
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,760
You think that I came

207
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:39,050
to the most unfindable place
in the galaxy for no reason at all?

208
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,965
Go away.

209
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,329
I'm not leaving without you!

210
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,407
Careful!

211
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:29,965
You're wasting your time.

212
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,483
Who are you?

213
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,447
I know this place.

214
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,845
Built a thousand generations ago

215
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,921
to keep these.

216
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:10,291
The original Jedi texts.

217
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:17,322
Just like me,
they're the last of the Jedi religion.

218
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,245
You've seen this place.

219
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,289
You've seen this island.

220
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,883
Only in dreams.

221
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,889
Who are you?

222
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:31,281
The Resistance sent me.

223
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,646
They sent you?

224
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,043
What's special about you?

225
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,848
- Where are you from?
- Nowhere.

226
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,806
- No one's from nowhere.
- Jakku.

227
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,765
All right, that is pretty much nowhere.

228
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,566
Why are you here, Rey, from nowhere?

229
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,767
The Resistance sent me.

230
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,040
We need your help.

231
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,201
The First Order's become unstoppable.

232
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,011
Why are you here?

233
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,002
Something inside me has always been there.

234
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,323
But now it's awake.

235
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,771
And I'm afraid.

236
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,041
I don't know what it is

237
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,563
or what to do with it.

238
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,131
And I need help.

239
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,002
You need a teacher.

240
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,241
I can't teach you.

241
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,087
Why not?

242
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,408
I've seen your daily routine.
You're not busy.

243
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:39,326
I will never train
another generation of Jedi.

244
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,967
I came to this island to die.

245
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,683
It's time for the Jedi to end.

246
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,726
Why?

247
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,400
Leia sent me here with hope.

248
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:55,405
If she was wrong, she deserves to know why.

249
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,766
We all do.

250
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,448
- You're demoted.
- What? Wait!

251
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,842
- We took down a dreadnought.
- At what cost?

252
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,730
You start an attack, you follow it through.

253
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:35,484
Poe, get your head out of your cockpit.

254
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:38,689
There are things that you cannot solve

255
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,764
by jumping in an X-wing
and blowing something up!

256
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:43,888
I need you to learn that.

257
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,769
There were heroes on that mission.

258
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,411
Dead heroes.

259
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:50,571
No leaders.

260
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,963
We're really nowhere.

261
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,963
How's Rey gonna find us now?

262
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,891
A cloaked binary beacon.

263
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,565
To light her way home.

264
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,128
All right, so until she gets back,
what's the plan?

265
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,089
We need to find a new base.

266
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,287
One with enough power

267
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:16,120
to get a distress signal
to our allies scattered in the Outer Rim.

268
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,804
Proximity alert!

269
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,081
They found us.

270
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,691
That's impossible.

271
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,043
That's Snoke's ship.

272
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,611
You gotta be kidding me.

273
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,440
- Can we jump to lightspeed?
- We have enough

274
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:41,851
fuel resources for just one jump.

275
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,206
Well, then, do it. We gotta get out of here.

276
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,691
Wait.

277
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,371
They've tracked us through lightspeed.

278
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,641
That's impossible.

279
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,161
Yes.

280
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,640
And they've done it.

281
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,760
So if we jump through lightspeed, they'll
just find us again and we'll be out of fuel.

282
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,841
They've got us.

283
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,764
Not yet, they don't.

284
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,200
Permission to jump in an X-wing
and blow something up?

285
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,691
Permission granted.

286
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,331
Admiral, swing us around!

287
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,608
Full astern. Rotate shields!

288
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,809
To your stations! Move, move, move!

289
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,681
Follow my lead.

290
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,126
Green Squadron to launch position.

291
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,408
Clear all launch traffic.

292
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,082
Don't wait for me! Jump in and fire her up!

293
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:48,205
Technicians, lock down supplies
for launch conditions.

294
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,883
Move! Move!

295
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,051
Poe, are you all right?

296
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,407
We need to get out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

297
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,971
We need to what?

298
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,485
Full engines ahead.

299
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:48,327
Get out of range of the Star Destroyers
and the fighters will fall back.

300
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,164
All craft, full engines!

301
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,368
Concentrate rear shields.

302
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,888
Ren, the Resistance have pulled out of range.

303
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,605
We can't cover you at this distance.

304
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:57,127
Return to the fleet.

305
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,361
What is the point of all this

306
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,922
if we can't blow up three tiny cruisers?

307
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,083
Well, they're faster and lighter, sir.

308
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,049
They can't lose us,
but they can keep at a range

309
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,407
where our cannons are ineffective
against their shields.

310
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,691
Well, keep up the barrage.

311
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,320
Let's at least remind them
that we're still here.

312
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,601
Very good, sir.

313
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,162
They won't last long burning fuel like this.

314
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,527
It's just a matter of time.

315
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,928
Move! Out of the way, everybody! Give room!

316
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,361
Life signs are weak, but she's fighting.

317
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,681
Artoo?

318
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,204
Artoo!

319
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,445
Yes.

320
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,960
Yeah, I know.

321
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,482
Hey, sacred island, watch the language.

322
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,000
Old friend.

323
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:28,688
I wish I could make you understand.

324
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:31,723
But I'm not coming back.

325
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,808
Nothing can make me change my mind.

326
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:42,606
Years ago, you served my father
in the Clone Wars.

327
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,531
Now he begs you to help him
in his struggle against the Empire.

328
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,880
I regret that I am unable to present
my father's request to you in person...

329
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,246
That was a cheap move.

330
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,051
...but my ship has fallen under attack,

331
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,680
and I'm afraid my mission
to bring you to Alderaan has failed.

332
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,768
This is our most desperate hour.

333
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,445
Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.

334
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,766
You're my only hope.

335
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:13,845
Tomorrow at dawn.

336
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,891
Three lessons.

337
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,646
I will teach you the ways of the Jedi

338
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,084
and why they need to end.

339
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,571
General Organa,

340
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,721
Leia,

341
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,565
is unconscious but recovering.

342
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,008
That's the only good news I have.

343
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:45,920
Admiral Ackbar,
all our leadership, they're gone.

344
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,003
Leia was the sole survivor on the bridge.

345
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,446
Oh, dear. Oh, dear!

346
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,730
If she were here, she'd say
save your sorrow for after the fight.

347
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,001
To that end,

348
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:01,806
the chain of command is clear
as to who should take her place.

349
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,570
Vice Admiral Holdo

350
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,764
of the cruiser Ninka.

351
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,285
Thank you, Commander.

352
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:16,806
Four hundred of us

353
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,485
on three ships.

354
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,606
We're the very last of the Resistance.

355
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,842
But we're not alone.

356
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,207
In every corner of the galaxy,

357
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,170
the downtrodden and oppressed
know our symbol,

358
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,204
and they put their hope in it.

359
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,560
We are the spark

360
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,201
that will light the fire that
will restore the Republic.

361
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,723
That spark, this Resistance, must survive.

362
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,882
That is our mission.

363
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,646
Now, to your stations.

364
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,447
And may the Force be with us.

365
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,286
That's Admiral Holdo?

366
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,320
Battle of Chyron Belt Admiral Holdo?

367
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,966
Not what I expected.

368
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,647
Vice Admiral? Commander Dameron.

369
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,645
With our current fuel consumption,
there's a very limited amount of time

370
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,530
that we can stay out of range
of those Star Destroyers.

371
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,047
Very kind of you to make me aware.

372
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,441
Let's get me those fuel projections.

373
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,365
And we need to shake 'em before we can
find a new base, so, what's our plan?

374
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,329
Our plan, captain?

375
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,884
Not commander, right?

376
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,202
Wasn't it Leia's last official act
to demote you

377
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,725
for your dreadnought plan

378
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,727
where we lost our entire bombing fleet?

379
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,480
"Captain." "Commander."

380
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,687
You can call me whatever you like.

381
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,690
I just wanna know what's going on.

382
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:48,521
Of course you do.

383
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,001
I understand.

384
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,524
I've dealt with plenty
of trigger-happy flyboys like you.

385
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,041
You're impulsive.

386
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,047
Dangerous.

387
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,004
And the last thing we need right now.

388
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,965
So stick to your post and follow my orders.

389
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:22,849
Turbolink banks seven and eight
are offline due to maintenance.

390
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,886
What are you doing here?

391
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,451
Hey. Hi.

392
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,446
Uh, I was... You know, I was just...

393
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,840
You're Finn!

394
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,006
The Finn!

395
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,244
- The Finn?
- Sorry.

396
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,170
I work behind pipes all day.

397
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,127
Doing talking with Resistance heroes
is not my forte.

398
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,486
Doing...

399
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,767
Doing talking.

400
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,451
I'm Rose.

401
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:21,920
Breathe.

402
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,128
- Okay.
- Yeah.

403
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,762
Look, I'm not a Resistance hero,
but it was nice talking to you, Rose.

404
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:32,764
May the Force be with you.

405
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,047
Wow. You, too.

406
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:40,444
Okay. But you are a hero.

407
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:44,090
You left the First Order,
what you did on the Starkiller Base...

408
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,731
When we heard about it, my sister Paige said,

409
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,450
"Rose, that's a real hero."

410
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:50,850
"Know right from wrong and don't run
away when it gets hard," she said.

411
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,281
You know...

412
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,120
Just this morning, I've had to stun

413
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,487
three people trying to
jump ship in this escape pod.

414
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,722
- What?
- They were running away.

415
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,241
That's disgraceful.

416
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,327
I know.

417
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,321
Anyway, uh...

418
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,164
Gotta get back to what I was doing, so...

419
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,651
What were you doing?

420
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,440
Uh, just...

421
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,363
- Doing some checks.
- Checking the escape pods.

422
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,887
- No, it's routine checks.
- By boarding one

423
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,051
with a packed bag.

424
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:20,761
Okay.

425
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:21,920
Listen, I'm...

426
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,643
I can't move. I can't move.

427
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,689
- I know.
- What happened?

428
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,649
I'm taking you to the brig
and turning you in for desertion.

429
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:42,961
I was not deserting.

430
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,362
- I told you that...
- My sister just died

431
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,124
protecting the fleet.

432
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,203
And you were running away.

433
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,367
I'm sorry.

434
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,082
But this fleet is doomed, and if my friend
comes back to it, she's doomed, too.

435
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,527
I've gotta get this...

436
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,889
I gotta get this beacon far away from here.

437
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,405
Then she'll find me and be safe.

438
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:04,129
You're a selfish traitor.

439
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,290
Look, we can't outrun the First Order fleet.

440
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,766
We can jump to lightspeed!

441
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,921
Well, they can track us through lightspeed.

442
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,560
They can track us through lightspeed?

443
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,640
Yeah.

444
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:13,800
They'd just show up thirty seconds later
and we'd have blown a ton of fuel,

445
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,008
which, by the way,
we're dangerously short on.

446
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,410
They can track us through lightspeed.

447
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:19,721
Yes. And they could...

448
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,241
I can't feel my teeth.

449
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,211
What did you shoot me with?

450
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,361
Active tracking.

451
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,567
What now?

452
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,281
Hyperspace tracking is new tech

453
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,966
but the principle must be
the same as any active tracker.

454
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,690
- They're only tracking us...
- Only tracking us...

455
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:33,166
...from the lead ship.

456
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,720
But we can't get to the tracker.

457
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,920
It's an A-class process,
they'll control it from the main bridge.

458
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,331
Well, I mean, yes,
but every A-class process...

459
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,881
...has a dedicated power breaker.

460
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:44,961
But... Wait, but who knows where
the breaker room is on a Star Destroyer?

461
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,129
I'm the guy that used to mop it.

462
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,163
If I can get us there,
I can shut their tracker down.

463
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,648
Just give it to me one more time, simpler.

464
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,122
So, the First Order's only tracking us
from one Destroyer, the lead one.

465
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,361
So we blow that one up?

466
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,726
I like where your head's at, but no.

467
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,610
They'd only start tracking us
from another Destroyer.

468
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:04,720
But if we can...

469
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,000
If we sneak on board the lead Destroyer
and disable the tracker

470
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,286
without them realizing, then we can...

471
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,522
They won't realize it's off
for one system cycle.

472
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,081
- About six minutes.
- Sneak on board.

473
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,925
Disable the tracker.

474
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,527
Our fleet escapes before they realize.

475
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,921
Hmm.

476
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,921
How'd you two meet?

477
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,881
Just luck.

478
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,721
Yeah?

479
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,240
Good luck?

480
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:39,841
Not sure yet.

481
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,685
Poe, we gotta do this.

482
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,047
It'll save the fleet and it'll save Rey.

483
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,371
If I must be the sole voice of reason,

484
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,523
Admiral Holdo will never agree to this plan.

485
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:54,326
Yeah, you're right, Threepio.

486
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:57,051
It's a "need-to-know" plan, and she doesn't.

487
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,850
- That wasn't exactly my...
- All right,

488
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,365
you guys shut down that tracker.

489
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,011
I'll be here to jump us to lightspeed.

490
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:03,161
The question is,

491
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,368
how do we sneak the two of you
onto Snoke's Destroyer?

492
00:43:05,560 --> 00:43:06,561
We steal clearance codes.

493
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,643
No, they're bio-hexacrypt
and rescrambled every hour.

494
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,131
We can't get through their
security shields undetected.

495
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,040
Nobody can.

496
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,405
Could I do it?

497
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,802
Of course I could do it. But I can't do it.

498
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,840
I'm a little tied down right now.

499
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,200
Oh!

500
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,200
Maz? What is happening?

501
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:31,640
Union dispute. You do not want
to hear about it.

502
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,484
But, lucky for you,

503
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:37,400
there's exactly one guy I trust
who can crack that kind of security!

504
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,530
He's a master codebreaker,

505
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,720
an ace pilot, a poet with a blaster.

506
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,321
Oh, my.

507
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,762
It sounds like this codebreaker fellow
can do everything.

508
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,400
Oh, yes, he can.

509
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,771
You'll find him with a red
plom bloom on his lapel

510
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,526
rolling at a high stakes table

511
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:03,883
in the casino on Canto Bight.

512
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,044
Canto Bight? No, no. That's... Maz...

513
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,043
Is there any way that we can
take care of this ourselves?

514
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,885
Sorry, kiddo. This is rarefied cracking.

515
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,765
You wanna get on that Destroyer,

516
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,405
I only know one option.

517
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,446
Find the Master Codebreaker.

518
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:49,161
You'll bring Luke Skywalker to me.

519
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,647
You're not doing this.
The effort would kill you.

520
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,721
Can you see my surroundings?

521
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:05,405
You're gonna pay for what you did!

522
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:06,846
I can't see yours.

523
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,726
Just you.

524
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:13,371
So, no.

525
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,360
This is something else.

526
00:46:23,320 --> 00:46:24,321
Luke.

527
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,444
What's that about?

528
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:43,441
I was cleaning my blaster. It went off.

529
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,640
Let's get started.

530
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,291
Who were those things?

531
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,411
Caretakers.

532
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,687
Island natives.

533
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,241
They've kept up the Jedi structures
since they were built.

534
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:01,530
I don't think they like me.

535
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,364
Can't imagine why.

536
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,321
Master Skywalker,
we need you to bring the Jedi back

537
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,290
because Kylo Ren is strong
with the dark side of the Force.

538
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:47,920
Without the Jedi, we won't
stand a chance against him.

539
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:50,401
What do you know about the Force?

540
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,765
It's a power that Jedi have
that lets them control people

541
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,920
and make things float.

542
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,001
Impressive.

543
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,128
Every word in that sentence was wrong.

544
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:02,883
Lesson one, sit here, legs crossed.

545
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,803
The Force is not a power you have.

546
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,281
It's not about lifting rocks.

547
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:17,483
It's the energy between all things,

548
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,722
a tension, a balance,

549
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,167
that binds the universe together.

550
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:23,321
Okay.

551
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,641
But what is it?

552
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,326
Close your eyes.

553
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,605
Breathe.

554
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,321
Now,

555
00:48:34,760 --> 00:48:35,921
reach out.

556
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:43,727
I feel something.

557
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,840
- You feel it?
- Yes, I feel it.

558
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:45,921
- That's the Force.
- Really?

559
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:47,571
Wow, it must be really strong with you.

560
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:48,721
I've never felt any...

561
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:49,881
Ow!

562
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:53,960
You meant reach out like...

563
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,601
I'll try again.

564
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,121
Breathe.

565
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,249
Just breathe.

566
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,642
Reach out with your feelings.

567
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,206
What do you see?

568
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,281
The island.

569
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:25,247
Life.

570
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,931
Death and decay,

571
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:30,925
that feeds new life.

572
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,647
Warmth.

573
00:49:34,760 --> 00:49:35,761
Cold.

574
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:39,451
Peace.

575
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,326
Violence.

576
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:44,851
And between it all?

577
00:49:45,640 --> 00:49:46,641
Balance.

578
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,640
An energy.

579
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,285
A Force.

580
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:56,524
And inside you?

581
00:49:57,680 --> 00:49:59,284
Inside me

582
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,522
that same Force.

583
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,810
And this is the lesson.

584
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:10,089
That Force does not belong to the Jedi.

585
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,125
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, is vanity.

586
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:16,448
Can you feel that?

587
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,850
There's something else

588
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,325
beneath the island.

589
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:25,241
A place.

590
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:27,761
A dark place.

591
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,007
Balance.

592
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,603
Powerful light, powerful darkness.

593
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,087
It's cold.

594
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:41,921
It's calling me.

595
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:44,287
Resist it, Rey.

596
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,606
Rey?

597
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,201
Rey!

598
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,849
You went straight to the dark.

599
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,770
That place was trying to show me something.

600
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,763
It offered something you needed.

601
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:08,681
And you didn't even try to stop yourself.

602
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,444
But I didn't see you.

603
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:15,084
Nothing from you.

604
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,841
You've closed yourself off from the Force.

605
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,765
Of course you have.

606
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,203
I've seen this raw strength only once before,

607
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:32,484
in Ben Solo.

608
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,370
It didn't scare me enough then.

609
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:37,085
It does now.

610
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,481
What was that?

611
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:51,846
Nothing, admiral.

612
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,405
Passing debris.

613
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,563
The fleet's only got 18 hours of fuel left.

614
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,291
We gotta hurry.

615
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,560
Still can't reach the Resistance?

616
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,324
Keep at it.

617
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,170
If you get through, check their status.

618
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,640
And ask about Finn.

619
00:52:47,840 --> 00:52:49,808
Why is the Force connecting us?

620
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,161
You and I.

621
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:52,731
Murderous snake.

622
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,529
You're too late. You lost. I found Skywalker.

623
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,006
Did he tell you what happened?

624
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,562
The night I destroyed his temple,
did he tell you why?

625
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,326
I know everything I need to know about you.

626
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:07,005
You do?

627
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:11,483
Ah, you do.

628
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,683
You have that look in your eyes.

629
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,649
From the forest.

630
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,560
When you called me a monster.

631
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,848
You are a monster.

632
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,445
Yes, I am.

633
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:54,761
Okay.

634
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,202
We get in, we find this codebreaker,
we get out.

635
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:59,567
You know this town? Canto Bight?

636
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:00,926
From stories.

637
00:54:01,080 --> 00:54:04,528
It's a terrible place filled with
the worst people in the galaxy.

638
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,641
Great.

639
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,530
I told those two, I said,

640
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:31,365
"This is a public beach.
You can't park that shuttle here."

641
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,126
But they just lit off toward the casino.

642
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:42,685
Place your bets. Place your bets.

643
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,644
All bets on the table right now, right now!

644
00:54:44,760 --> 00:54:45,807
Place your bets here.

645
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:02,569
Aw, yes! This place is great!

646
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,531
Okay.

647
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,401
Maz said this Master Codebreaker
would have a red plom bloom on his lapel.

648
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,324
Let's find him and get out of here.

649
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,520
Well played. The house wins.

650
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:16,800
Where are your manners, more like?

651
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,961
Come on!

652
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:42,720
We've covered this whole casino.

653
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,800
Zero red plom blooms.

654
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,120
Where is this guy?

655
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:51,964
Were those what I think they were?

656
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,163
- What are those things?
- Fathiers.

657
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,605
I've never seen a real one.

658
00:56:04,280 --> 00:56:06,931
Look, this whole place is beautiful.
I mean, come on.

659
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,330
Why do you hate it so much?

660
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,566
Look closer.

661
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,605
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

662
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:24,528
The First Order stripped
our ore to finance their military

663
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:28,048
then shelled us to test their weapons.

664
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:36,162
They took everything we had.

665
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,051
And who do you think these people are?

666
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:43,968
There's only one business in the galaxy
that'll get you this rich.

667
00:56:44,640 --> 00:56:45,767
War.

668
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:48,607
Selling weapons to the First Order.

669
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:55,367
I wish I could put my fist through this
whole lousy, beautiful town.

670
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,847
Red plom bloom!

671
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,127
Red plom bloom!

672
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,481
The Master Codebreaker!

673
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,400
Yep, those are the shuttle parkers.

674
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,601
All right.

675
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:29,169
You two are under arrest
for parking violation 27B/6.

676
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,320
You have the right to remain...

677
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:32,520
- What was that?
- No, no, no. Not now, Lovey.

678
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:33,647
I'm on a roll.

679
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:19,045
Lesson two.

680
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:23,404
Now that they're extinct,
the Jedi are romanticized, deified.

681
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,645
But if you strip away the myth
and look at their deeds,

682
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:29,168
the legacy of the Jedi is failure.

683
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,641
Hypocrisy, hubris.

684
00:59:30,760 --> 00:59:31,761
That's not true.

685
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:34,486
At the height of their powers,
they allowed Darth Sidious to rise

686
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,529
create the Empire, and wipe them out.

687
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,843
It was a Jedi Master who was responsible

688
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:42,129
for the training and creation of Darth Vader.

689
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,805
And a Jedi who saved him.

690
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,050
Yes, the most hated man in the galaxy.

691
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:48,407
But you saw there was conflict inside him.

692
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,206
You believed that he wasn't gone.
That he could be turned.

693
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:53,244
And I became a legend.

694
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:56,762
For many years, there was balance

695
00:59:56,920 --> 00:59:58,331
and then I saw

696
00:59:58,600 --> 00:59:59,601
Ben.

697
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:04,727
My nephew with that mighty Skywalker blood.

698
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,245
And in my hubris,

699
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,563
I thought I could train him,
I could pass on my strengths.

700
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:14,082
Han was Han about it, but...

701
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,165
Leia

702
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,967
trusted me with her son.

703
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,761
I took him,

704
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:26,564
and a dozen students,

705
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:29,125
and began a training temple.

706
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,283
By the time I realized

707
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:36,609
I was no match for
the darkness rising in him,

708
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,770
it was too late.

709
01:00:40,080 --> 01:00:41,445
What happened?

710
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,371
I went to confront him.

711
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,324
And he turned on me.

712
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:52,211
Ben, no!

713
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:57,448
He must have thought I was dead.

714
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,360
When I came to,

715
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,124
the temple was burning.

716
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,245
He had vanished
with a handful of my students.

717
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,527
And slaughtered the rest.

718
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,963
Leia blamed Snoke,

719
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:16,880
but it was me.

720
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,011
I failed.

721
01:01:22,520 --> 01:01:25,569
Because I was Luke Skywalker.

722
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:28,403
Jedi Master.

723
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,404
A legend.

724
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:39,887
The galaxy may need a legend.

725
01:01:44,480 --> 01:01:48,770
I need someone to show me
my place in all this.

726
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,330
And you didn't fail Kylo.

727
01:01:56,520 --> 01:01:58,170
Kylo failed you.

728
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,564
I won't.

729
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,085
The main cruiser's
still keeping beyond range.

730
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:26,403
But their medical frigate is out of fuel

731
01:02:27,520 --> 01:02:29,284
and its shields are down.

732
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,329
The beginning of their end.

733
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:34,564
Destroy it.

734
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,922
The last of our crew has been evacuated
and heading your way.

735
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:43,610
It's been an honor, admiral.

736
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,649
Godspeed, Rebels!

737
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,047
Admiral,

738
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,728
fuel reserves at six hours.

739
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:56,568
Maintain our current course.

740
01:02:57,400 --> 01:02:59,084
Steady on.

741
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,161
Finn,

742
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,448
Rose, where are you guys?

743
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:13,961
Deal me in.

744
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:18,080
Thanks.

745
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:23,249
Finn, the fleet is running on fumes.

746
01:03:24,120 --> 01:03:26,880
Without a codebreaker
to break us onto Snoke's Star Destroyer...

747
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,684
- What do we do?
- I don't know.

748
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:32,846
Unless you got a thief in your pocket,
our plan is shot.

749
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,251
Um, I can do it.

750
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:41,401
What?

751
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:44,207
What?

752
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:46,161
What?

753
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,924
S-S-Sorry, I just

754
01:03:48,320 --> 01:03:50,360
couldn't help but overhear all the stuff

755
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:53,410
that you were saying really loudly

756
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:55,445
while I was trying to sleep.

757
01:03:57,640 --> 01:03:59,051
Codebreaker?

758
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:01,445
Thief?

759
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:03,606
I can do it.

760
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,525
We're not talking about
picking pockets, okay?

761
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,483
Yeah.

762
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,408
D-D-Don't let the wrapper fool you, friend.

763
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:17,647
Me and the First Order codeage go way back.

764
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:20,607
And,

765
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:24,209
if the price is right,

766
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:30,367
I could break you into
old man S-S-Snoke's boudoir.

767
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,049
- No.
- We're... We got it covered.

768
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:38,966
Ha-tuk-ga.

769
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,204
- Did he just...
- Yeah.

770
01:04:55,760 --> 01:04:57,410
We gotta get out of here! This way!

771
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:58,640
Why you little...

772
01:05:03,760 --> 01:05:05,560
D-D-Did you do this?

773
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:09,727
Hey, hands up!

774
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,122
- Hands up!
- Yeah, man.

775
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,844
What's your story, roundie?

776
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:32,640
They went this way!

777
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,403
- Lock down all the exits.
- Wait.

778
01:05:43,960 --> 01:05:45,564
That smelled great.

779
01:05:45,720 --> 01:05:47,563
Those cops will be here any minute. What now?

780
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:54,930
Whoa! Ooh!

781
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:22,610
No, wait. Please, don't!

782
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,240
We're with the Resistance.

783
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:39,208
Roger that. Checking the stables now.

784
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:47,120
This way.

785
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,200
They must have come through here.

786
01:06:54,360 --> 01:06:55,361
Hyah!

787
01:07:01,240 --> 01:07:03,243
Go, go, go! Whoo!

788
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:10,680
Stop enjoying this! Stop enjoying this!

789
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,567
We've got them. They're not going anywhere.

790
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:26,681
Ahhh!

791
01:07:36,760 --> 01:07:37,761
Huh?

792
01:08:03,840 --> 01:08:05,444
Move, move, move! Get out of the way!

793
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,522
Our ship's on the beach straight ahead!

794
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:12,521
We need cover!

795
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:24,686
Too much cover!

796
01:08:37,200 --> 01:08:38,327
There it is!

797
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,843
- No!
- Come on!

798
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,889
Let the herd go. Stick with the perps.

799
01:09:05,640 --> 01:09:06,687
Where'd they go?

800
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,001
I think we lost him!

801
01:09:11,160 --> 01:09:12,810
Now we get down to the beach
and circle back around...

802
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,001
Cliff!

803
01:09:24,160 --> 01:09:25,200
We're trapped.

804
01:09:28,160 --> 01:09:29,366
It was worth it, though.

805
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:31,286
To tear up that town,

806
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:32,880
make 'em hurt.

807
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:43,481
Go.

808
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:49,760
Now it's worth it.

809
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:01,041
There they are.

810
01:10:06,680 --> 01:10:09,200
BB-8! Wait, are you flying that thing?

811
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,246
Ah.

812
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:16,924
N-N-Need a lift?

813
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:11,801
Luke.

814
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,281
Leia.

815
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,009
I'd rather not do this now.

816
01:11:25,680 --> 01:11:27,045
Yeah, me, too.

817
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:31,004
Why did you hate your father?

818
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,925
Do you have something,
a cowl or something you could put on?

819
01:11:41,720 --> 01:11:44,007
Why did you hate your father?
Give me an honest answer.

820
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,126
You had a father who loved you,
he gave a damn about you.

821
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:50,368
- I didn't hate him.
- Then why?

822
01:11:50,760 --> 01:11:51,761
Why what?

823
01:11:55,280 --> 01:11:56,725
Why what? Say it.

824
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,371
Why did you...

825
01:12:00,160 --> 01:12:02,128
Why did you kill him?

826
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:03,766
I don't understand.

827
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:04,921
No?

828
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,684
Your parents threw you away like garbage.

829
01:12:06,880 --> 01:12:08,962
- They didn't!
- They did.

830
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,929
But you can't stop needing them.

831
01:12:11,080 --> 01:12:12,320
It's your greatest weakness.

832
01:12:13,160 --> 01:12:14,241
Looking for them everywhere,

833
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,606
in Han Solo,

834
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:17,889
now in Skywalker.

835
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,089
Did he tell you what happened that night?

836
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:24,441
Yes.

837
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:27,601
No.

838
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,010
He had sensed my power,

839
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,050
as he senses yours.

840
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,004
And he feared it.

841
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:55,126
Liar.

842
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:00,925
Let the past die.

843
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:04,841
Kill it if you have to.

844
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,131
That's the only way to become
what you were meant to be.

845
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:55,243
No! No!

846
01:14:35,720 --> 01:14:37,131
Rey?

847
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:08,885
I should have felt trapped or panicked.

848
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,531
But I didn't.

849
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:14,920
This didn't go on forever,

850
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:17,162
I knew it was leading somewhere.

851
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:20,400
And that, at the end,
it would show me what I came to see.

852
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:23,971
Rey.

853
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,687
Let me see them.

854
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:37,163
My parents,

855
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,402
please.

856
01:16:14,520 --> 01:16:16,602
I thought I'd find answers here.

857
01:16:18,200 --> 01:16:19,565
I was wrong.

858
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,884
I'd never felt so alone.

859
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,811
You're not alone.

860
01:16:32,920 --> 01:16:34,251
Neither are you.

861
01:16:35,280 --> 01:16:36,611
Rey?

862
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,084
It isn't too late.

863
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,847
Stop!

864
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,124
Is it true? Did you try to murder him?

865
01:17:57,280 --> 01:17:59,726
Leave this island now!

866
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:01,086
Stop.

867
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:03,361
Stop!

868
01:18:07,920 --> 01:18:09,001
Did you do it?

869
01:18:09,200 --> 01:18:11,203
Did you create Kylo Ren?

870
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,450
Tell me the truth.

871
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:50,648
I saw darkness.

872
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,363
I'd sensed it building in him.

873
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,171
I'd seen it in moments during his training.

874
01:18:57,680 --> 01:18:59,523
But then I looked inside,

875
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,725
and it was beyond what I ever imagined.

876
01:19:07,960 --> 01:19:10,122
Snoke had already turned his heart.

877
01:19:11,800 --> 01:19:14,560
He would bring destruction,
and pain, and death,

878
01:19:14,640 --> 01:19:17,680
and the end of everything I love
because of what he will become.

879
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,640
And for the briefest moment of pure instinct,

880
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,007
I thought I could stop it.

881
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,560
It passed like a fleeting shadow.

882
01:19:27,440 --> 01:19:29,329
And I was left with shame,

883
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,608
and with consequence.

884
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:35,249
And the last thing I saw

885
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,680
were the eyes of a frightened boy

886
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,240
whose master had failed him.

887
01:19:41,920 --> 01:19:42,921
Ben, no!

888
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,960
You failed him by thinking
his choice was made.

889
01:19:52,040 --> 01:19:53,041
It wasn't.

890
01:19:53,480 --> 01:19:55,289
There's still conflict in him.

891
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,091
If he were turned from the dark side,
that could shift the tide.

892
01:19:58,240 --> 01:20:00,004
This could be how we win.

893
01:20:00,160 --> 01:20:03,164
This is not going to go the way you think.

894
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:04,920
It is.

895
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,885
Just now when we touched hands,

896
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:09,326
I saw his future.

897
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:11,970
As solid as I'm seeing you.

898
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:15,967
If I go to him, Ben Solo will turn.

899
01:20:16,160 --> 01:20:17,287
Rey,

900
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:19,842
don't do this.

901
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,324
Then he's our last hope.

902
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:19,845
Master Yoda.

903
01:21:20,680 --> 01:21:23,126
Young Skywalker.

904
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:26,845
I'm ending all of this.

905
01:21:27,160 --> 01:21:29,640
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

906
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,006
I'm gonna burn it down.

907
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,001
Hmm.

908
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,840
Ah, Skywalker.

909
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:10,967
Missed you, have I.

910
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:25,810
So it is time

911
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:29,169
for the Jedi Order to end.

912
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,562
Time it is.

913
01:22:32,160 --> 01:22:33,651
Hmm.

914
01:22:36,280 --> 01:22:41,880
For you to look past
a pile of old books, hmm?

915
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,724
The sacred Jedi texts.

916
01:22:43,880 --> 01:22:46,042
Oh. Read them, have you?

917
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:48,205
- Well, I...
- Page-turners

918
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,640
they were not.

919
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:52,169
Yes, yes, yes.

920
01:22:52,360 --> 01:22:53,691
Wisdom they held,

921
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:57,322
but that library contained
nothing that the girl Rey

922
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,403
does not already possess.

923
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,244
Skywalker,

924
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,083
still looking to the horizon.

925
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,720
Never here, now, hmm?

926
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:12,491
The need in front of your nose.

927
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:14,281
Hmm?

928
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:17,810
I was weak.

929
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,041
Unwise.

930
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,771
Lost Ben Solo, you did.

931
01:23:23,480 --> 01:23:25,926
Lose Rey, we must not.

932
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:29,170
I can't be what she needs me to be.

933
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:32,007
Heeded my words not, did you?

934
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,966
Pass on what you have learned.

935
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:37,248
Strength, mastery.

936
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:39,804
But weakness,

937
01:23:39,960 --> 01:23:42,361
folly, failure also.

938
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:45,649
Yes, failure most of all.

939
01:23:45,800 --> 01:23:48,770
The greatest teacher, failure is.

940
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,081
Luke,

941
01:24:01,680 --> 01:24:05,082
we are what they grow beyond.

942
01:24:05,840 --> 01:24:10,050
That is the true burden of all masters.

943
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:25,248
Four parsecs to go. This thing really cooks.

944
01:24:25,400 --> 01:24:27,084
I just hope we're in time.

945
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,651
You can actually do this, right?

946
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,203
Yeah, about that...

947
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,408
Guys, I can do it.

948
01:24:39,320 --> 01:24:42,051
But there exists a pre-"do it"
conversation about price.

949
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:45,167
Once we're done, the Resistance
will give you whatever you want.

950
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:47,087
What you got deposit-wise?

951
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,167
Are you kidding me? Look at us.

952
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:53,004
Is that Haysian smelt?

953
01:24:55,640 --> 01:24:56,971
That's something.

954
01:24:57,120 --> 01:24:59,327
No, we gave you our word.
You're gonna get paid.

955
01:24:59,440 --> 01:25:00,646
That should be enough.

956
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,086
Guys, I wanna keep helping.

957
01:25:03,200 --> 01:25:06,682
But no something, n-n-no doing.

958
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:08,843
Okay, listen here, you've got...

959
01:25:09,400 --> 01:25:11,050
Do it.

960
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:15,889
Now I can help.

961
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:19,441
Give it back.

962
01:25:20,920 --> 01:25:21,920
What?

963
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:24,082
Give it back!

964
01:25:24,240 --> 01:25:26,129
You have no idea how much
that medallion means to her.

965
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:29,729
What are you... Why are you
ransacking your own ship?

966
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:33,240
It's not your ship.

967
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,087
He says I stole it.

968
01:25:36,240 --> 01:25:38,440
- Yeah, I got that.
- We stole it.

969
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:42,602
At least you're stealing from the bad guys

970
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:44,241
and helping the good.

971
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,368
Good guys, bad guys,

972
01:25:46,520 --> 01:25:48,568
made-up words.

973
01:25:49,280 --> 01:25:52,841
Let's see who formerly owned
this gorgeous hunk-uh.

974
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,167
Ah, this guy was an arms dealer.

975
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,169
Made his bank selling weapons
to the bad guys.

976
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:04,881
Oh...

977
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:07,971
And the good.

978
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,324
Finn, let me learn you something big.

979
01:26:13,720 --> 01:26:15,848
It's all a machine, partner.

980
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:20,365
Live free, don't join.

981
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:34,801
That was the last of their support ships.

982
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,047
It's just their main cruiser now.

983
01:26:36,600 --> 01:26:38,091
And their fuel reserve?

984
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:39,970
By our calculation,

985
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:41,611
critical.

986
01:26:45,840 --> 01:26:46,840
She in there?

987
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:47,921
The admiral's banned you from the bridge.

988
01:26:48,040 --> 01:26:49,485
- Let's not have a scene.
- No, let's.

989
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,483
- Holdo?
- You're not allowed in here.

990
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,000
- Flyboy.
- Cut it, lady.

991
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:55,800
We had a fleet, now we're down to one ship,

992
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,610
and you've told us nothing!

993
01:26:58,080 --> 01:27:01,323
Tell us that we have a plan!

994
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:02,481
That there's hope!

995
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,051
When I served under Leia,

996
01:27:04,200 --> 01:27:06,680
she would say, hope is like the sun.

997
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:09,366
If you only believe in it
when you can see it...

998
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:11,762
You'll never make it through the night.

999
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:13,531
Yes.

1000
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:23,648
Are you fueling up the transports?

1001
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:30,446
You are.

1002
01:27:31,160 --> 01:27:32,400
All of them?

1003
01:27:33,680 --> 01:27:36,286
We're abandoning ship? Is that...

1004
01:27:36,680 --> 01:27:38,569
That's what you got?
That's what you brought us to?

1005
01:27:39,280 --> 01:27:40,281
Coward!

1006
01:27:41,160 --> 01:27:44,050
Those transport ships
are unarmed, unshielded.

1007
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:46,487
We abandon this cruiser, we're done.

1008
01:27:46,640 --> 01:27:49,371
We don't stand a chance.
No, you are not just a coward,

1009
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:51,045
you are a traitor.

1010
01:27:51,760 --> 01:27:54,002
Get this man off my bridge.

1011
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:03,120
Finn, Holdo's loading
the crew in the shuttle.

1012
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,009
She's going to abandon ship. Where are you?

1013
01:28:05,160 --> 01:28:06,890
Poe, we're on our way back to the fleet.

1014
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:08,201
We're so close.

1015
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:09,407
Did you find the Master Codebreaker?

1016
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,688
Well, we found a codebreaker.

1017
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,200
We can shut the tracker down.

1018
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:15,283
Just buy us a little more time.

1019
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,010
All right. Hurry.

1020
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:24,964
As soon as I launch,
you jump back out of range.

1021
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:27,880
Stay there until you get my signal
for where to rendezvous.

1022
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:32,480
If you see Finn before I do,

1023
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:33,560
tell him...

1024
01:28:35,760 --> 01:28:37,520
Yeah, perfect. Tell him that.

1025
01:29:44,520 --> 01:29:46,841
Cloaking our approach.
We should be off their scopes.

1026
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:49,961
Then we slice a slit in their shield.

1027
01:29:50,120 --> 01:29:51,770
Blip bloppity bloop,

1028
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:54,768
and slip right through.

1029
01:30:13,200 --> 01:30:16,329
So a stormtrooper
and a who now are doing what?

1030
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:17,641
They are trying to save us.

1031
01:30:17,800 --> 01:30:19,404
This is our best chance for escape.

1032
01:30:19,600 --> 01:30:21,523
You have to give Finn and Rose
all the time that you can.

1033
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:24,047
You have bet the survival of the Resistance

1034
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:26,965
on bad odds and put us all at risk.

1035
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:28,281
There's no time now.

1036
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,480
We have to get clear of the cruiser.
Load the transports.

1037
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:31,560
Right away, admiral.

1038
01:30:31,640 --> 01:30:32,760
Yeah, I was afraid you'd say that.

1039
01:30:32,840 --> 01:30:34,800
Vice Admiral Holdo,

1040
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:36,689
I am relieving you of your command

1041
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:40,128
for the survival of this ship,
its crew, and the Resistance.

1042
01:30:41,000 --> 01:30:43,242
I hope you understand what you're doing.

1043
01:30:43,760 --> 01:30:44,761
Yeah.

1044
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:46,127
I'm going to the bridge.

1045
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:48,283
If they move, stun them.

1046
01:31:08,200 --> 01:31:11,645
- ...at least three cycles so far.
- Yes, sir. We are working on it.

1047
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,763
I will do my best, sir.

1048
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,166
Almost there.

1049
01:31:41,320 --> 01:31:43,084
You don't have to do this.

1050
01:31:43,640 --> 01:31:45,244
I feel the conflict in you.

1051
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:47,130
It's tearing you apart.

1052
01:31:48,160 --> 01:31:50,527
Ben, when we touched hands,

1053
01:31:50,680 --> 01:31:52,205
I saw your future.

1054
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:54,801
Just the shape of it, but solid and clear.

1055
01:31:55,360 --> 01:31:57,602
You will not bow before Snoke.

1056
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,210
You'll turn.

1057
01:32:04,440 --> 01:32:06,090
I'll help you.

1058
01:32:06,640 --> 01:32:08,165
I saw it.

1059
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,970
I saw something, too.

1060
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:12,401
Because of what I saw,

1061
01:32:12,560 --> 01:32:15,006
I know when the moment comes,
you'll be the one to turn.

1062
01:32:15,720 --> 01:32:17,529
You'll stand with me.

1063
01:32:18,200 --> 01:32:19,201
Rey,

1064
01:32:20,400 --> 01:32:22,721
I saw who your parents are.

1065
01:32:37,600 --> 01:32:41,924
Well done, my good and faithful apprentice.

1066
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:46,290
My faith in you is restored.

1067
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,642
Young Rey.

1068
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:53,330
Welcome.

1069
01:32:58,680 --> 01:32:59,966
So this is it.

1070
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:02,009
The tracker's right behind this door.

1071
01:33:15,200 --> 01:33:17,328
Haysian smelt.

1072
01:33:17,760 --> 01:33:19,171
Best conductor.

1073
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:29,285
And you're welcome.

1074
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,124
Good time to figure out
how we get back to the fleet?

1075
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:34,960
I know where the nearest escape pods are.

1076
01:33:35,040 --> 01:33:36,040
Course you do.

1077
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:37,920
BB-8, tell me something good.

1078
01:33:39,800 --> 01:33:41,006
Poe, we're almost there.

1079
01:33:41,160 --> 01:33:42,400
Have the cruiser prepped for lightspeed.

1080
01:33:42,520 --> 01:33:44,762
Yeah, I'm on it, pal. You just hurry.

1081
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:48,883
Clear the bridge, escort the
officers down to the hangar.

1082
01:33:49,040 --> 01:33:52,529
Commander... Captain Dameron,
Admiral Holdo was looking for you.

1083
01:33:52,680 --> 01:33:53,841
Yeah, we spoke.

1084
01:33:55,280 --> 01:33:57,522
Sir, I am almost afraid to ask.

1085
01:33:57,680 --> 01:33:59,523
Good instinct, Threepio. Go with that.

1086
01:34:12,280 --> 01:34:13,281
Seal that door!

1087
01:34:16,080 --> 01:34:17,120
We're running out of time.

1088
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,440
Come on, how's it going?

1089
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:20,170
Almost there.

1090
01:34:21,200 --> 01:34:23,043
Threepio, where do you think you're going?

1091
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:25,203
It would be quite against my programming

1092
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,090
- to be party to a mutiny.
- Hey!

1093
01:34:27,240 --> 01:34:29,083
It is not correct protocol.

1094
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:32,360
Oh! Neither is this!

1095
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,408
Finn? We're ready to make the jump!

1096
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:35,840
Now or never.

1097
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:40,811
Now.

1098
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:48,841
You're up.

1099
01:35:06,640 --> 01:35:08,840
- You there, hands up!
- Watch 'em, watch 'em.

1100
01:35:08,920 --> 01:35:10,960
- Drop your weapons, now!
- Hands up, Rebel scum.

1101
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:12,724
Get down! I said, down!

1102
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,289
FN-2187.

1103
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,527
So good to have you back.

1104
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:30,487
They didn't make it.

1105
01:35:44,400 --> 01:35:45,527
Leia.

1106
01:35:57,000 --> 01:35:58,365
Please board the transports

1107
01:35:58,480 --> 01:36:00,767
according to your evacuation designation.

1108
01:36:00,920 --> 01:36:01,920
All transports must be cleared...

1109
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,161
Okay, help me push him up, guys.

1110
01:36:03,560 --> 01:36:05,051
That one's a troublemaker.

1111
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:06,920
I like him.

1112
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,687
Me, too.

1113
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,403
Now, time to board your transport.

1114
01:36:12,560 --> 01:36:14,210
For the transports to escape,

1115
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:18,170
someone needs to stay behind
and pilot the cruiser.

1116
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:24,330
Too many losses.

1117
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:28,128
I can't take any more.

1118
01:36:28,480 --> 01:36:29,766
Sure you can.

1119
01:36:31,160 --> 01:36:33,208
You taught me how.

1120
01:36:35,640 --> 01:36:36,920
May the Force be...

1121
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:40,690
You go on. I've said it enough.

1122
01:36:42,440 --> 01:36:45,922
May the Force be with you always.

1123
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,920
Cloaking device activated.

1124
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:55,843
We should be off their scopes.

1125
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,401
Let's hope this works.

1126
01:37:15,040 --> 01:37:17,327
Come closer, child.

1127
01:37:20,120 --> 01:37:22,646
So much strength.

1128
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:26,083
Darkness rises,

1129
01:37:26,280 --> 01:37:30,001
and light to meet it.

1130
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:34,845
I warned my young apprentice
that as he grew stronger,

1131
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,731
his equal in the light would rise.

1132
01:37:40,320 --> 01:37:41,400
Skywalker...

1133
01:37:41,480 --> 01:37:43,323
I assumed.

1134
01:37:44,400 --> 01:37:45,401
Wrongly.

1135
01:37:48,640 --> 01:37:50,449
Closer, I said.

1136
01:37:57,240 --> 01:37:59,004
You underestimate Skywalker,

1137
01:37:59,720 --> 01:38:00,847
and Ben Solo,

1138
01:38:01,520 --> 01:38:02,806
and me.

1139
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:05,323
It will be your downfall.

1140
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,601
Oh...

1141
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:08,883
Have you seen something?

1142
01:38:09,320 --> 01:38:12,290
A weakness in my apprentice.

1143
01:38:12,440 --> 01:38:14,443
Is that why you came?

1144
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,884
Young fool.

1145
01:38:19,080 --> 01:38:22,767
It was I who bridged your minds.

1146
01:38:23,200 --> 01:38:26,568
I stoked Ren's conflicted soul.

1147
01:38:26,720 --> 01:38:29,849
I knew he was not strong enough
to hide it from you.

1148
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:35,245
And you were not wise enough
to resist the bait.

1149
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:40,131
And now,

1150
01:38:40,680 --> 01:38:45,520
you will give me Skywalker.

1151
01:38:46,720 --> 01:38:49,166
Then I will kill you

1152
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:52,045
with the cruelest stroke.

1153
01:38:52,880 --> 01:38:53,881
No.

1154
01:38:54,520 --> 01:38:55,760
Yes.

1155
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:02,485
Give me

1156
01:39:03,800 --> 01:39:05,530
everything.

1157
01:39:06,080 --> 01:39:07,764
No! No!

1158
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:09,287
No!

1159
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:18,010
No. No.

1160
01:39:18,160 --> 01:39:19,366
No, no, no!

1161
01:39:24,280 --> 01:39:25,361
Poe.

1162
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,081
What is that?

1163
01:39:32,240 --> 01:39:34,049
The mineral planet, Crait.

1164
01:39:34,200 --> 01:39:36,567
An uncharted hideout from
the days of the Rebellion.

1165
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:38,969
- That's a Rebel base?
- Abandoned,

1166
01:39:39,440 --> 01:39:41,600
but heavily armored with enough power

1167
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:44,241
to get a distress signal to our allies
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1168
01:39:44,400 --> 01:39:47,521
Holdo knew the First Order
was tracking our big ship.

1169
01:39:47,680 --> 01:39:50,525
They're not monitoring for little transports.

1170
01:39:51,040 --> 01:39:53,247
So we could slip down
to the surface unnoticed

1171
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:56,688
and hide till the First Order passes.

1172
01:39:58,840 --> 01:39:59,921
That could work.

1173
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:03,528
She was more interested

1174
01:40:03,640 --> 01:40:06,007
in protecting the light than she was

1175
01:40:06,560 --> 01:40:09,040
seeming like a hero.

1176
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:22,286
Godspeed,

1177
01:40:22,560 --> 01:40:24,005
Rebels.

1178
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,085
Well done, Phasma.

1179
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:58,965
Your ship and payment, as we agreed.

1180
01:41:06,840 --> 01:41:08,444
You lying snake.

1181
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,567
We got caught,

1182
01:41:16,240 --> 01:41:18,322
I cut a d-d-deal.

1183
01:41:19,120 --> 01:41:22,171
Wait, cut a deal with what?

1184
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:23,924
Sir, we checked on the
information from the thief.

1185
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:26,886
We ran a decloaking scan, and sure enough,

1186
01:41:27,040 --> 01:41:29,361
30 Resistance transports
have just launched from the cruiser.

1187
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:32,722
He told us the truth.

1188
01:41:33,520 --> 01:41:35,204
Will wonders never cease?

1189
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:36,401
No.

1190
01:41:36,840 --> 01:41:37,841
Our weapons are ready?

1191
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:39,365
Ready and aimed, sir.

1192
01:41:40,200 --> 01:41:41,850
Fire at will.

1193
01:41:42,560 --> 01:41:44,085
Wait. No, no. No, you can't!

1194
01:41:44,640 --> 01:41:46,005
No!

1195
01:42:00,160 --> 01:42:01,764
Admiral, we're taking fire!

1196
01:42:01,920 --> 01:42:03,365
- Do we turn around?
- No, you're too far out.

1197
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,170
Full speed to planetfall.

1198
01:42:05,320 --> 01:42:06,321
Full speed!

1199
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:14,160
Well, well,

1200
01:42:14,240 --> 01:42:18,006
I did not expect Skywalker to be so wise.

1201
01:42:18,600 --> 01:42:21,171
We will give him and the Jedi Order

1202
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,727
the death he desires.

1203
01:42:24,360 --> 01:42:25,600
After the Rebels are gone,

1204
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,251
we will go to his planet

1205
01:42:27,400 --> 01:42:31,246
and obliterate the entire island.

1206
01:42:38,040 --> 01:42:39,451
Such spunk.

1207
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:41,247
Look here now.

1208
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:53,720
The entire Resistance on those transports...

1209
01:42:54,360 --> 01:42:58,081
Soon they will all be gone.

1210
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:01,569
For you, all is lost.

1211
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:09,605
Ooh. And still that fiery spit of hope.

1212
01:43:11,240 --> 01:43:14,403
You have the spirit of a true Jedi!

1213
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,211
And because of that,

1214
01:43:25,320 --> 01:43:26,731
you must die.

1215
01:43:29,520 --> 01:43:31,682
My worthy apprentice,

1216
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,606
son of darkness, heir apparent to Lord Vader.

1217
01:43:35,760 --> 01:43:39,208
Where there was conflict,
I now sense resolve.

1218
01:43:39,400 --> 01:43:42,085
Where there was weakness, strength.

1219
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,484
Complete your training,

1220
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:49,203
and fulfill your destiny.

1221
01:43:58,440 --> 01:44:00,124
I know what I have to do.

1222
01:44:02,160 --> 01:44:03,280
Ben.

1223
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:07,167
You think you can turn him?

1224
01:44:07,720 --> 01:44:09,529
Pathetic child.

1225
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:13,481
I cannot be betrayed,

1226
01:44:13,680 --> 01:44:15,728
I cannot be beaten.

1227
01:44:15,880 --> 01:44:18,247
I see his mind,

1228
01:44:18,400 --> 01:44:21,480
I see his every intent.

1229
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:22,561
Yes.

1230
01:44:24,080 --> 01:44:29,769
I see him turning
the lightsaber to strike true.

1231
01:44:30,320 --> 01:44:31,401
And now,

1232
01:44:32,200 --> 01:44:34,089
foolish child,

1233
01:44:34,240 --> 01:44:36,208
he ignites it,

1234
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:40,401
and kills his true enemy!

1235
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:23,250
Come on, give it full thrusters. Full speed!

1236
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:24,811
I am, sir.

1237
01:45:27,480 --> 01:45:29,005
You murdering bastard!

1238
01:45:29,640 --> 01:45:31,802
T-T-Take it easy, Big F.

1239
01:45:32,240 --> 01:45:35,085
They blow you up today,
you blow them up tomorrow.

1240
01:45:35,800 --> 01:45:37,450
It's just business.

1241
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,206
You're wrong.

1242
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,927
Maybe.

1243
01:47:29,400 --> 01:47:30,401
Ben!

1244
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,841
The fleet.

1245
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,001
Order them to stop firing.

1246
01:47:45,160 --> 01:47:46,969
There's still time to save the fleet.

1247
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:56,761
Ben?

1248
01:47:58,960 --> 01:48:00,928
It's time to let old things die.

1249
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,766
Snoke,

1250
01:48:04,920 --> 01:48:06,206
Skywalker.

1251
01:48:08,240 --> 01:48:09,605
The Sith,

1252
01:48:10,280 --> 01:48:12,123
the Jedi, the Rebels...

1253
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:13,645
Let it all die.

1254
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:15,327
Rey.

1255
01:48:17,360 --> 01:48:18,851
I want you to join me.

1256
01:48:20,800 --> 01:48:23,371
We can rule together
and bring a new order to the galaxy.

1257
01:48:23,520 --> 01:48:24,931
Don't do this, Ben.

1258
01:48:26,080 --> 01:48:27,161
Please don't go this way.

1259
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:30,802
No, no. You're still holding on! Let go!

1260
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:34,247
Do you wanna know the truth
about your parents?

1261
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,651
Or have you always known?

1262
01:48:39,240 --> 01:48:40,810
And you've just hidden it away.

1263
01:48:42,840 --> 01:48:44,365
You know the truth.

1264
01:48:45,200 --> 01:48:46,645
Say it.

1265
01:48:49,760 --> 01:48:51,000
Say it.

1266
01:48:53,000 --> 01:48:54,525
They were nobody.

1267
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:56,330
They were filthy junk traders

1268
01:48:56,480 --> 01:48:58,403
who sold you off for drinking money.

1269
01:49:00,440 --> 01:49:03,569
They're dead in a paupers'
grave in the Jakku desert.

1270
01:49:04,320 --> 01:49:06,288
You have no place in this story.

1271
01:49:06,440 --> 01:49:08,443
You come from nothing. You're nothing.

1272
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:14,046
But not to me.

1273
01:49:18,120 --> 01:49:19,121
Join me.

1274
01:49:32,600 --> 01:49:33,647
Please.

1275
01:50:04,040 --> 01:50:05,041
Sir,

1276
01:50:05,640 --> 01:50:08,405
the Resistance cruiser's
preparing to jump to lightspeed.

1277
01:50:09,200 --> 01:50:10,281
It's empty.

1278
01:50:10,440 --> 01:50:12,249
They're just trying
to pull our attention away.

1279
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:13,881
Pathetic.

1280
01:50:14,080 --> 01:50:16,242
Keep your fire on the transports.

1281
01:50:44,080 --> 01:50:46,811
Execution by blaster is too good for them.

1282
01:50:46,960 --> 01:50:49,008
Let's make this hurt.

1283
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,721
Finn.

1284
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,964
On my command.

1285
01:51:06,760 --> 01:51:08,046
She's running away.

1286
01:51:10,160 --> 01:51:11,321
No, she isn't.

1287
01:51:25,240 --> 01:51:28,210
- No!
- Fire on that cruiser!

1288
01:51:42,040 --> 01:51:43,041
Execute.

1289
01:52:27,160 --> 01:52:28,241
Finn!

1290
01:52:28,400 --> 01:52:31,290
There's a shuttle back that way! We gotta go!

1291
01:52:46,680 --> 01:52:48,125
Traitor!

1292
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:50,801
What?

1293
01:53:14,120 --> 01:53:15,121
Finn!

1294
01:53:34,520 --> 01:53:36,284
You are a bug in the system.

1295
01:53:36,640 --> 01:53:37,846
Let's go, chrome dome.

1296
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,647
Come on!

1297
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,321
No!

1298
01:54:03,280 --> 01:54:04,281
Hey.

1299
01:54:20,240 --> 01:54:22,891
You were always scum.

1300
01:54:24,440 --> 01:54:25,965
Rebel scum.

1301
01:54:39,440 --> 01:54:41,682
Hey! Need a lift?

1302
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,568
What happened?

1303
01:55:22,160 --> 01:55:23,844
The girl murdered Snoke.

1304
01:55:28,280 --> 01:55:29,645
What happened?

1305
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:32,371
She took Snoke's escape craft.

1306
01:55:32,760 --> 01:55:34,171
We know where she's going.

1307
01:55:35,160 --> 01:55:36,890
Get all our forces down
to that Resistance base.

1308
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:38,805
Let's finish this.

1309
01:55:39,600 --> 01:55:40,761
Finish this?

1310
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,442
Who do you think you're talking to?

1311
01:55:43,880 --> 01:55:46,406
You presume to command my army?

1312
01:55:47,160 --> 01:55:50,528
Our Supreme Leader is dead! We have no ruler!

1313
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:58,362
The Supreme Leader is dead.

1314
01:56:00,320 --> 01:56:03,449
Long live the Supreme Leader.

1315
01:56:21,280 --> 01:56:23,442
They're coming, shut the door.

1316
01:56:31,200 --> 01:56:32,884
Incoming!

1317
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:38,369
Go! Go! Move!

1318
01:56:39,320 --> 01:56:41,288
Get that shield door down!

1319
01:56:57,120 --> 01:56:58,440
No! Wait, don't shoot! It's us!

1320
01:56:58,520 --> 01:56:59,567
No! Don't shoot!

1321
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:00,721
Hold your fire!

1322
01:57:00,880 --> 01:57:02,928
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire!

1323
01:57:05,480 --> 01:57:06,720
- Finn?
- Finn!

1324
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:08,930
Rose! You're not dead!

1325
01:57:09,120 --> 01:57:10,320
Where's my droid?

1326
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:12,647
Buddy!

1327
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:15,326
I'm so glad to see you!

1328
01:57:16,720 --> 01:57:18,882
Wait, what? Wait, wait, wait, slow down.

1329
01:57:19,040 --> 01:57:20,326
Is this all that's left?

1330
01:57:30,680 --> 01:57:32,887
All right, shields are up
so they can't hit us from orbit.

1331
01:57:33,200 --> 01:57:34,440
Use whatever power we've got left

1332
01:57:34,600 --> 01:57:36,648
to broadcast a distress signal
to the Outer Rim.

1333
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,484
Use my personal code.

1334
01:57:38,960 --> 01:57:41,805
If there are any allies to the Resistance,

1335
01:57:42,360 --> 01:57:43,487
it's now or never.

1336
01:57:44,200 --> 01:57:46,123
Rose, what do you got?

1337
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:50,207
Rotting munitions, rusted artillery,
some half-gutted skim speeders.

1338
01:57:50,360 --> 01:57:53,805
Well, let's just pray that big-ass door

1339
01:57:53,920 --> 01:57:56,200
holds long enough for us to get help.

1340
01:58:06,480 --> 01:58:08,289
A battering ram cannon.

1341
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:10,090
A what now?

1342
01:58:10,520 --> 01:58:11,931
Miniaturized Death Star tech.

1343
01:58:12,080 --> 01:58:13,844
It'll crack that door open like an egg.

1344
01:58:14,600 --> 01:58:16,330
There has to be a back way
out of here, right?

1345
01:58:17,560 --> 01:58:19,369
BB-8, what do you got?

1346
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:23,369
BB-8 has analyzed the mine's schematics.

1347
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,640
This is the only way in or out.

1348
01:58:34,000 --> 01:58:35,001
Come on.

1349
01:58:36,000 --> 01:58:37,240
We have allies.

1350
01:58:37,480 --> 01:58:39,323
People believe in Leia.

1351
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,570
They'll get our message, they'll come.

1352
01:58:42,120 --> 01:58:44,362
But we have to buy time.

1353
01:58:45,320 --> 01:58:48,005
We gotta take out that cannon.

1354
01:58:52,280 --> 01:58:53,280
On me! On me!

1355
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:55,481
Move! Move!

1356
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:57,165
Go back! Gather your weapons!

1357
01:58:57,320 --> 01:58:58,765
Get over here!

1358
01:58:58,920 --> 01:58:59,921
Hold your fire!

1359
01:59:17,200 --> 01:59:18,201
Salt.

1360
01:59:18,360 --> 01:59:19,646
Ground forces, incoming.

1361
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,484
Copy that. On our way.

1362
01:59:38,880 --> 01:59:40,041
Engage your mono-ski.

1363
01:59:40,200 --> 01:59:41,770
The green toggle.

1364
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:52,961
All right, listen up.

1365
01:59:53,160 --> 01:59:56,289
I don't like these rust buckets
and I don't like our odds, but...

1366
01:59:56,760 --> 01:59:58,091
What the hell?

1367
01:59:58,240 --> 01:59:59,526
Just keep it tight

1368
01:59:59,680 --> 02:00:02,650
and don't get drawn in too close
till they roll that cannon out front.

1369
02:00:22,520 --> 02:00:24,762
All right, ground forces, lay down some fire!

1370
02:00:37,800 --> 02:00:39,689
Thirteen incoming light craft.

1371
02:00:39,840 --> 02:00:41,763
Shall we hold until we clear them?

1372
02:00:41,960 --> 02:00:44,850
No. The Resistance is in that mine.

1373
02:00:45,360 --> 02:00:46,521
Push through.

1374
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:52,885
Fighters, break off!

1375
02:01:02,960 --> 02:01:05,850
Come on! We gotta hold them
till they pull up that cannon!

1376
02:01:21,280 --> 02:01:23,328
Rose, you got three right behind you!

1377
02:01:31,200 --> 02:01:32,201
I can't lose 'em!

1378
02:01:39,320 --> 02:01:41,004
Whoo! Yeah!

1379
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:56,008
Whoo! I like this!

1380
02:02:04,600 --> 02:02:07,683
Blow that piece of junk out of the sky!

1381
02:02:07,880 --> 02:02:09,245
All fighters!

1382
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:18,084
Chewie, peel off from the battle.

1383
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,605
Draw them away from the speeders.

1384
02:02:25,400 --> 02:02:27,050
She drew 'em off! All of 'em!

1385
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:28,804
Oh, they hate that ship!

1386
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:42,401
Chewie!

1387
02:03:13,760 --> 02:03:14,761
There it is!

1388
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,087
That is a big gun.

1389
02:03:21,240 --> 02:03:22,526
Okay, it's heavily armored.

1390
02:03:22,680 --> 02:03:24,683
Our only shot is right down the throat.

1391
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:34,244
The cannon's opening. This is our chance.

1392
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:35,561
All firepower on those speeders.

1393
02:03:35,760 --> 02:03:38,206
Concentrate all fire on the speeders!

1394
02:03:45,080 --> 02:03:46,520
We're taking heavy losses.

1395
02:03:58,920 --> 02:04:00,809
They're picking us all off.
We're not gonna make it.

1396
02:04:00,960 --> 02:04:02,690
All right, making my final approach.

1397
02:04:02,840 --> 02:04:04,251
Target in sight, guns are hot.

1398
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:05,640
No! Pull off!

1399
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:06,847
What?

1400
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,451
The cannon is charged! It's a suicide run!

1401
02:04:08,600 --> 02:04:09,965
All craft, pull away!

1402
02:04:10,120 --> 02:04:12,202
- No! I'm almost there!
- Retreat, Finn!

1403
02:04:12,360 --> 02:04:13,600
That's an order!

1404
02:04:22,600 --> 02:04:24,762
Finn? It's too late! Don't do this!

1405
02:04:24,920 --> 02:04:26,923
No! I won't let them win!

1406
02:04:28,960 --> 02:04:30,928
No! Finn, listen to Poe!

1407
02:04:31,080 --> 02:04:32,525
We have to retreat!

1408
02:04:44,560 --> 02:04:47,006
The cannon is warming up now.

1409
02:04:47,160 --> 02:04:48,366
Copy that. We see it.

1410
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,284
Preparing to fire.

1411
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:33,923
Move! Go, go! Quick!

1412
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,764
Let's go, let's go!

1413
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,366
Rose?

1414
02:05:49,000 --> 02:05:50,127
Rose?

1415
02:05:50,520 --> 02:05:51,931
Rose?

1416
02:05:52,840 --> 02:05:54,680
Why would you do that? Huh?

1417
02:05:54,760 --> 02:05:56,649
I was almost there.

1418
02:05:57,440 --> 02:05:58,931
Why would you stop me?

1419
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,808
I saved you,

1420
02:06:02,840 --> 02:06:03,841
dummy.

1421
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:06,644
That's how we're gonna win.

1422
02:06:06,800 --> 02:06:09,201
Not fighting what we hate,

1423
02:06:09,640 --> 02:06:12,007
saving what we love.

1424
02:06:31,440 --> 02:06:32,805
General Hux,

1425
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,530
advance.

1426
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,564
No quarter.

1427
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:39,530
No prisoners.

1428
02:06:41,280 --> 02:06:44,523
Our distress signal's been
received at multiple points,

1429
02:06:44,680 --> 02:06:46,762
but no response.

1430
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:49,084
They've heard us,

1431
02:06:49,440 --> 02:06:51,568
but no one's coming.

1432
02:06:55,920 --> 02:06:58,082
We fought till the end.

1433
02:07:00,400 --> 02:07:05,361
But the galaxy has lost all its hope.

1434
02:07:06,720 --> 02:07:08,165
The spark

1435
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,571
is out.

1436
02:07:37,160 --> 02:07:38,730
Luke.

1437
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:49,766
I know what you're gonna say.

1438
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:52,803
I changed my hair.

1439
02:07:54,800 --> 02:07:56,484
It's nice that way.

1440
02:07:58,320 --> 02:07:59,970
Leia,

1441
02:08:01,120 --> 02:08:02,121
I'm sorry.

1442
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:04,163
I know.

1443
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,567
I know you are.

1444
02:08:07,360 --> 02:08:09,328
I'm just glad you're here

1445
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:11,810
at the end.

1446
02:08:13,200 --> 02:08:15,043
I came to face him, Leia.

1447
02:08:17,040 --> 02:08:19,282
And I can't save him.

1448
02:08:19,640 --> 02:08:22,928
I held out hope for so long,

1449
02:08:25,680 --> 02:08:28,251
but I know my son is gone.

1450
02:08:29,120 --> 02:08:31,851
No one's ever really gone.

1451
02:09:07,440 --> 02:09:09,283
Master Luke.

1452
02:09:32,320 --> 02:09:33,321
Stop!

1453
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:02,487
I want every gun we have to fire on that man.

1454
02:10:07,640 --> 02:10:09,131
Do it.

1455
02:10:25,760 --> 02:10:26,887
More!

1456
02:10:30,160 --> 02:10:31,161
More!

1457
02:10:45,720 --> 02:10:47,370
That's enough.

1458
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:51,007
That's enough!

1459
02:10:56,920 --> 02:10:58,570
Do you think you got him?

1460
02:10:59,880 --> 02:11:01,723
Now, if we're ready to get moving,

1461
02:11:01,880 --> 02:11:04,087
we can finish this.

1462
02:11:04,240 --> 02:11:05,367
Sir?

1463
02:11:31,840 --> 02:11:33,171
Bring me down to him.

1464
02:11:33,520 --> 02:11:36,360
Keep the door covered
and don't advance until I say.

1465
02:11:36,440 --> 02:11:37,441
Supreme Leader,

1466
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:39,400
don't get distracted, our goal...

1467
02:11:41,880 --> 02:11:43,120
Right away, sir.

1468
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:45,765
Med pack!

1469
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:48,008
I need a med pack!

1470
02:11:48,200 --> 02:11:50,248
She's hurt pretty bad.

1471
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:10,286
It's Kylo Ren.

1472
02:12:10,480 --> 02:12:11,686
Luke's facing him alone.

1473
02:12:11,840 --> 02:12:13,205
Well, we should help him. Let's go.

1474
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:15,084
No, wait. Wait.

1475
02:12:29,040 --> 02:12:31,407
Did you come back to say you forgive me?

1476
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,289
To save my soul?

1477
02:12:36,040 --> 02:12:37,644
No.

1478
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,762
He's doing this for a reason.

1479
02:13:00,600 --> 02:13:02,360
He's stalling so we can escape.

1480
02:13:02,440 --> 02:13:03,440
Escape?

1481
02:13:03,520 --> 02:13:04,600
He's one man against an army.

1482
02:13:04,680 --> 02:13:06,205
We have to help him, we have to fight.

1483
02:13:06,360 --> 02:13:08,560
No, no. We are the spark
that'll light the fire

1484
02:13:08,640 --> 02:13:10,244
that'll burn the First Order down.

1485
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:14,443
Skywalker's doing this so we can survive.

1486
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:16,080
There's gotta be a way out of this mine.

1487
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,321
Hell, how did he get in here?

1488
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:21,531
Sir, it is possible that
a natural unmapped opening exists.

1489
02:13:21,720 --> 02:13:24,690
But this facility is such
a maze of endless tunnels

1490
02:13:24,840 --> 02:13:26,560
that the odds of finding an exit

1491
02:13:26,640 --> 02:13:29,320
- are 15,428...
- Shh. Shush. Hush. Shush up.

1492
02:13:29,400 --> 02:13:30,970
Shut up!

1493
02:13:32,160 --> 02:13:33,890
- To one.
- Listen.

1494
02:13:36,560 --> 02:13:38,802
My audio sensors no longer detect the...

1495
02:13:38,960 --> 02:13:40,041
Exactly.

1496
02:13:45,920 --> 02:13:48,651
Where'd the crystal critters go?

1497
02:13:54,320 --> 02:13:55,321
Follow me.

1498
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:01,848
What are you looking at me for?

1499
02:14:02,000 --> 02:14:03,491
Follow him.

1500
02:14:15,120 --> 02:14:17,600
If the beacon's right beneath us,
they've got to be somewhere.

1501
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:19,280
Keep scanning for life forms.

1502
02:14:29,080 --> 02:14:30,605
This way.

1503
02:14:35,160 --> 02:14:36,810
I see them! Chewie, there!

1504
02:14:50,480 --> 02:14:53,370
No. No, no, no.

1505
02:14:56,760 --> 02:14:57,761
No!

1506
02:15:10,000 --> 02:15:11,843
Lifting rocks.

1507
02:15:51,920 --> 02:15:54,446
I failed you, Ben.

1508
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,647
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sure you are!

1509
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,882
The Resistance is dead.

1510
02:16:01,040 --> 02:16:02,610
The war is over.

1511
02:16:02,800 --> 02:16:04,803
And when I kill you,

1512
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:07,406
I will have killed the last Jedi.

1513
02:16:07,560 --> 02:16:08,687
Amazing.

1514
02:16:09,240 --> 02:16:13,006
Every word of what you just said was wrong.

1515
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:18,489
The Rebellion is reborn today.

1516
02:16:20,680 --> 02:16:22,683
The war

1517
02:16:22,840 --> 02:16:24,524
is just beginning.

1518
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:29,611
And I will not be the last Jedi.

1519
02:17:09,400 --> 02:17:11,448
I'll destroy her,

1520
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,648
and you,

1521
02:17:13,800 --> 02:17:15,450
and all of it.

1522
02:17:19,280 --> 02:17:20,281
No.

1523
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:24,643
Strike me down in anger
and I'll always be with you.

1524
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,362
Just like your father.

1525
02:18:18,800 --> 02:18:19,801
No.

1526
02:18:24,120 --> 02:18:26,248
See you around, kid.

1527
02:18:39,920 --> 02:18:41,331
No!

1528
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:20,800
C'ai!

1529
02:21:20,880 --> 02:21:22,848
Such a friend.

1530
02:21:23,200 --> 02:21:24,920
Chewie!

1531
02:21:26,240 --> 02:21:28,004
It looks good.

1532
02:21:28,440 --> 02:21:29,601
That was crazy, man.

1533
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:32,531
- Hi.
- Hi.

1534
02:21:33,120 --> 02:21:34,167
I'm Poe.

1535
02:21:35,000 --> 02:21:36,001
Rey.

1536
02:21:36,360 --> 02:21:37,407
I know.

1537
02:21:49,720 --> 02:21:51,720
When we get to the Outer Rim,
I have a contact there.

1538
02:21:51,800 --> 02:21:53,040
Quite definitely possible.

1539
02:22:03,520 --> 02:22:05,011
Luke is gone.

1540
02:22:05,880 --> 02:22:07,291
I felt it.

1541
02:22:07,880 --> 02:22:09,723
But it wasn't sadness or pain.

1542
02:22:11,000 --> 02:22:13,321
It was peace and purpose.

1543
02:22:14,280 --> 02:22:15,611
I felt it, too.

1544
02:22:18,280 --> 02:22:21,204
How do we build a Rebellion from this?

1545
02:22:25,640 --> 02:22:28,371
We have everything we need.

1546
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:49,809
Luke Skywalker,

1547
02:22:49,960 --> 02:22:51,769
Jedi Master.

GENERAL LEIA ORGANA dispatches secret agents to gather
intelligence, while REY, the last hope of the Jedi, trains
for battle against the diabolical FIRST ORDER.
