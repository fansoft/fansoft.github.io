<p align="center">SATURDAY AFTERNOON</p>
<p align="center">ABOUT TEA TIME</p>
<p align="center">Jesus Christ: How blessed are those who know that he's of God. How blessed
are the sorrowful; they shall find consolation.</p>
<p align="center">How blessed are those of gentle spirit; they shall have the earth for their
possession. How blessed are those who hunger and</p>
<p align="center">thirst to see right prevail; they shall be satisfied. How blessed are those
whose hearts are pure; they shall see God.</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Speak up!</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Sch, quiet, mum!</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Well, I can't hear a thing. Let's go to stoning!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Ssch!</p>
<p align="center">Brian: You can go to a stoning anytime!</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Ah, come on, Brian!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Will you be quiet!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose's Wife: Don't pick your nose!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: I wasn't picking my nose. I was scratching it.</p>
<p align="center">Bignose's Wife: You was picking it while you was talking to that lady!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: I wasn't!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose's Wife: Leave it alone! Give it a rest!</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Do you mind, I can't hear a word he's saying.</p>
<p align="center">Bignose's Wife: Don't you &quot;do you mind&quot; me! I was talking to my
husband!</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Well, can't you talk to him somewhere else? I can't hear a bloody
thing!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Don't you swear at my wife!</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Well, I was only asking her to shut up so that I can hear what he's
saying, Bignose!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose's Wife: Don't you call my husband &quot;Bignose&quot;!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Well, he has got a big nose.</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man: Could you be quiet, please? What was that?</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: I don't know, I was too busy talking to Bignose!</p>
<p align="center">Spectator I: I think it was &quot;Blessed are the cheesemakers&quot;.</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man's Wife: Aha, what's so special about the cheesemakers?</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man: Well, obviously it's not meant to be taken literally; it refers
to any manufacturers of dairy products.</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: See, if you hadn't been going on we'd have heard that, Bignose.</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Hey, say that once more, I'll smash your bloody face in!</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Oh, better keep listening, might be a bit about &quot;Blessed are
the Bignoses&quot;.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Oh, lay off him!</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Oh, you're not so bad yourself, conkface. Where are you two from?
Nose City?</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: One more time, mate, I'll take you to fucking cleaners!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose's Wife: Language! And don't pick your nose!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: I wasn't going to pick my nose! I'm gonna thump him!</p>
<p align="center">Spectator II: Hear that, blessed are the Greek!</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man: The Greek?</p>
<p align="center">Spectator II: Hmm. Well, apparently he's going to inherit the earth.</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man: Did anyone catch his name?</p>
<p align="center">Bignose's Wife: You're not gonna thump anybody!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: I'll thump him if he calls me &quot;Bignose&quot; again!</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Oh, shut up, Bignose!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Ha, right! I warned you! I really will slug you! Saaah...</p>
<p align="center">Bignose's Wife: Oh, it's the meek! Blessed are the meek! Oh, that's nice,
innit? I'm glad they're getting something because they</p>
<p align="center">had a hell of a time.</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Listen, I'm only telling the truth, you have got a very big nose!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Hey, your nose is going to be three foot wide across your face by
the time I'm finished with you!</p>
<p align="center">Spectator I &amp; Spectator II: Ssch!</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Well, who hit yours then? Goliath's big brother?</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: All right, that's your last warning!</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man's Wife: Oh, do quiet down!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose hitting Bearded Man's Wife: [Thump]</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man's Wife: Aiih!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Silly bitch, getting in the way!</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man: Aaargh!</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Racket all the way...</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Oh, come on, let's go to the stoning!</p>
<p align="center">Brian: All right.</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Well, blessed is just about everyone with a fested interest in the
status quo, if I'm right with you there, Reg?</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Yeah, well, what Jesus quietly fails to appreciate is that it's the meek
who're the problem.</p>
<p align="center">Judith: Yes, yes, absolutely Reg, yes, I see!</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Oh, come on, Brian, or they'll have him stoned before we get there.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: All right.</p>
<p align="center">Bignose: Aaargh!</p>
<p align="center">Bearded Man's Wife: Lay off!</p>
<p align="center">Wiseguy: Hey, don't be there, he's just lying there, Bignose. Stop that,
there's a rape going on, frankly speaking, it's he that</p>
<p align="center">started it all...</p>

<p align="center">Mother: Ah, how I hate wearing these beards.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Why aren't women allowed to go to stonings, mum?</p>
<p align="center">Mother: It's written, that's why.</p>
<p align="center">Beard and stone seller: Pssst! Beard, madam?</p>
<p align="center">Woman carrying donkey: Oh, look, I haven't got the time to go to no stonings.
He's not well again.</p>
<p align="center">Donkey: Oink! Oink!</p>
<p align="center">Beard and stone seller: Stone, sir?</p>
<p align="center">Mother: No, they've got a lot there, lying around on the ground.</p>
<p align="center">Beard and stone seller: Oh, not like these, sir. Look at this! Feel the
quality of that, that's craftmanship, sir.</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Hmm...all right, we'll have two with points and...a big flat one.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Could I have a flat one, mum?</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Ssch!</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Sorry! Dad!</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Ehm...all right, two points, ahm...two flats and a packet of gravel.</p>
<p align="center">Beard and stone seller: Packet of gravel. Should be a good one this afternoon.</p>

<p align="center">Ex-leper: Aah, I could do that sir, yeah. Yeah, I could do that, I suppose.
Well, what the thing was I was going to ask him if</p>
<p align="center">he'd make me a bit lame in one leg during the middle of the week. You know,

<p align="center">Brian: Who was it?</p>
<p align="center">Mother: Huh...Naughtius Maximus his name was. Hmm...promised me the known

<p align="center">Judith: I do feel Reg, that any anti-imperialistic group like ours must
reflect such a divergence of interest within its</p>
<p align="center">powerbase.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Agreed. Rogers?</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Yes, I think Judith's point of view is very valid, Reg, provided the
movement never forgets that it is the unalienable</p>
<p align="center">right of every man...</p>
<p align="center">Stan: Or woman.</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: ...or woman to rid himself...</p>
<p align="center">Stan: Or herself.</p>

<p align="center">Rogers: Or sister...where was I?</p>
<p align="center">Reg: I think you'd finished.</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Oh. Right.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Further more, it it the birthright of every man...</p>
<p align="center">Stan: Or woman.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Why don't you shut up about women, Stan? You're putting us off.</p>
<p align="center">Stan: Women have a perfect right to play a part in our movement, Reg.</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Why are you always on about women, Stan?</p>
<p align="center">Stan: I want to be one.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: What?</p>
<p align="center">Stan: I want to be a woman. From now on, I want you all to call me Loretta.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: What?</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: It's my right as a man.</p>
<p align="center">Judith: Well, why do you want to be Loretta, Stan?</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: I want to have babies.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: You want to have babies?!</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: It's every man's right to have babies if he wants them.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: But...you can't have babies!</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: Don't you opress me!</p>
<p align="center">Reg: I'm not opressing you, Stan. You haven't got a womb. Where is the foetus
going to gestate? You're going to keep it in a</p>
<p align="center">box?</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: Sniff.</p>
<p align="center">Judith: Here, I've got an idea. Suppose you agree that he can't actually have
babies, not having a womb, which is nobody's</p>
<p align="center">fault, not even the Romans', but that he can have the right to have babies.</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Good idea, Judith. We shall fight the oppressors for your right to
have babies, brother. Sister! Sorry.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: What's the point?</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: What?</p>
<p align="center">Reg: What's the point of fighting for his right to have babies, when he can't
have babies?</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: It is symbolic of our struggle against opression.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Symbolic of his struggle against reality.</p>

<p align="center">Rogers: We get in through the underground heating-system here ,up through an

in our custody, and fore with issue our demands.</p>
<p align="center">Any questions?</p>
<p align="center">Revolutionary I: What exactly are the demands?</p>
<p align="center">Reg: We're giving Pilate two days to dismantle the entire apparatus of the
Roman imperialist state, and if he doesn't agree</p>
<p align="center">immediately, we execute her.</p>
<p align="center">Matthias: Cut her head off?</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Cut all her bits off! Send them back on the hour, every hour! Seldom
why not to be tried for it.</p>

<p align="center">Reg: Yeah.</p>

ever given us in return?</p>

<p align="center">Reg: What?</p>
<p align="center">Revolutionary I: The aqueduct.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Oh. Yeah, yeah, they did give us that, ah, that's true, yeah.</p>
<p align="center">Revolutionary II: And the sanitation.</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: Oh, yeah, the sanitation, Reg. Remember what the city used to be
like.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Yeah, all right, I'll grant you the aqueduct and sanitation, the two
things the Romans have done.</p>
<p align="center">Matthias: And the roads.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Oh, yeah, obviously the roads. I mean the roads go without saying, don't
they? But apart from the sanitation, the</p>
<p align="center">aqueduct, and the roads...</p>

<p align="center">Revolutionary V: And the wine.</p>
<p align="center">All revolutionaries except Reg: Oh, yeah! Right!</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Yeah! Yeah, that's something we'd really miss Reg, if the Romans
left. Huh.</p>
<p align="center">Revolutionary VI: Public bathes.</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: And it's safe to walk in the streets at night now, Reg.</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Yeah, they certainly know how to keep order. Let's face it; they're
the only ones who could in a place like this.</p>
<p align="center">All revolutionaries except Reg: Hahaha...all right...</p>
<p align="center">Reg: All right, but apart from the sanitation, the medicine, education, wine,
public order, irrigation, roads, the fresh-water</p>
<p align="center">system and public health, what have the Romans ever done for us?</p>
<p align="center">Revolutionary I: Brought peace?</p>

<p align="center">Reg: Did he finish the slogan?</p>
<p align="center">Judith: A hundred times! In letters ten foot high, all the way around the
palace!</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Oh, great! Great! We...we need doers in our movement Brian, but...before
you join us, know this: there is not one of us</p>
<p align="center">here who would not gladly suffer death to rid this country the Romans once
and for all.</p>
<p align="center">Revolutionary VII: Ehm...well, one.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Oh, yeah. Yeah, there's one. But otherwise we're solid. Are you with us?</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Yes!</p>
<p align="center">Reg: From now on you shall be called &quot;Brian that is called Brian&quot;.
Fill him in about the raid on the Pilate's palace, Francis.</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Right! This is the plan!</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Now, this is the palace at Caesar Square. Our commando-unit will
approach from Fish Street under cover of night,</p>
<p align="center">and make our way to the north-western main drain. If questioned, we are
sewage workers on our way to a conference. Reg,</p>
<p align="center">our glorious leader and founder of the PFJ, will be co-ordinating the
assailant at the drain heighin. Though he himself will not</p>
<p align="center">be taking part in any terrorist action, as he has a bad back.</p>
<p align="center">Revolutionary VIII: Aren't you going to come with us?</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Solidarity, brother!</p>
<p align="center">Revolutionary VIII: Oh, yes...solidarity, Reg.</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Once in the sewer, timing will be of the essence. There's a Roman
feast later in the evening, so we must move fast. And</p>
<p align="center">don't wear your best sandals. Turning left here, we enter the Caesar
Augustus' Memorial Sewer, and from there proceed</p>
<p align="center">directly to the hypocaust. This has just been retiled, so terrorists: careful
with those weapons! We will now be directly beneath</p>

<p align="center">Prisoner: You must have slipt him a few shekels, eh?</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Slipt him a few shekels? You saw him spit in my face!</p>
<p align="center">Prisoner: Oh, ohoh, what wouldn't I give to be spat at in the face? I
sometimes hang awake at night, dreaming of being spat at</p>
<p align="center">in the face.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Well, it's not exactly friendly, is it? They had me in manacles!</p>
<p align="center">Prisoner: Manacles! Ohuuhoh...what idea of reaving; is to be allowed to put
in manacles, just for a few hours. They must</p>
<p align="center">think a sun shines out your arse, sonny!</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Oh, lay off me, I've had a hard time!</p>
<p align="center">Prisoner: You've had a hard time!? I've been here five years, they only hung
me the right way up yesterday! So don't you</p>

<p align="center">Prisoner: They must think you're lord God Almighty.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: What will they do to me?</p>
<p align="center">Prisoner: Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Crucifixion?!</p>
<p align="center">Prisoner: Yeah. First offense.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Get away with crucifixion?! It's...</p>
<p align="center">Prisoner: Best thing the Romans ever did for us.</p>
<p align="center">Brian: What?</p>
<p align="center">Prisoner: Oh, yeah. If we didn't have crucifixion, this country'd be in a
right bloody mess.</p>

<p align="center">Brian: Guard!</p>

<p align="center">Prisoner: Sorry!</p>
<p align="center">Jailor I: Huah! Huhuhu...</p>
<p align="center">Prisoner: Now take my case. They hang me up here five years ago. Every night
they take me down for twenty minutes, then</p>
<p align="center">they hang me up again. Which I guard as very fair, in view of what I've done.
And if nothing else, it has taught me to respect</p>
<p align="center">the Romans, and it has taught me that you'll never get anywhere in this life,
unless you are prepared to do a fair day's work</p>
<p align="center">for a fair day's...</p>

<p align="center">Centurion: Ah, no, I know, sir, but...</p>
<p align="center">Pontius Pilate: My addressing is one of the high-points of Passover! My
friend Biggus Dickus has come all the way from</p>
<p align="center">Vome just to hear it!</p>
<p align="center">Centurion: Hail Caesar!</p>
<p align="center">Biggus Dickus: Hail Thaethar!</p>
<p align="center">Centurion: You're not...uh, you're not, ehm... thinking of giving it a miss
this year, then, sir?</p>
<p align="center">Pontius Pilate: Give it a miss!?</p>
<p align="center">Centurion: Well, it's just that they're in a rather funny mood today, sir.</p>
<p align="center">Pontius Pilate: Really, Centurion! I'm surprised you, a man like you, vaffled
by a vuffle of vowdy rebels.</p>
<p align="center">Centurion: A bit thundery, sir.</p>
<p align="center">Pontius Pilate: Take him away!</p>
<p align="center">Brian: Ah, no! I'm a Roman! I can prove it, honestly!</p>
<p align="center">Pontius Pilate: And crucify him well! Biggus!</p>
<p align="center">Centurion: I-I, I really wouldn't, sir!</p>
<p align="center">Pontius Pilate: Out of the way, centurion!</p>
<p align="center">Biggus Dickus: Let me come with you, Pontiuth. I may be of thome athithstance
if there ith a thudden crithith!</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Right! Now, item four: Attainment of world supremacy within the next
five years. Ah, Francis, you've been doing some</p>
<p align="center">work on this?</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Yeah, thank you, Reg. Well, quite frankly, siblings, I think five
years is optimistic, unless we can smash the Roman</p>
<p align="center">Empire within the next twelve months!</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Twelve months?</p>
<p align="center">Rogers: Yeah, twelve months. And let's face it, as empires go, this is the
big one. So we gotta get up of our arses and stop just</p>
<p align="center">talking about it!</p>
<p align="center">All in PFJ: Yeah! Yeah! Hear!</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: I agree! It's action that counts, not words, and we need action now!</p>
<p align="center">All in PFJ: Yeah! Yeah!</p>
<p align="center">Reg: You're right. We could sit around here all day, talking, passing
resolutions, making clever speeches, it's not to ship one</p>
<p align="center">Roman soldier!</p>
<p align="center">Francis: So let's just stop gabbing on about it! It's completely pointless,
and it's getting us nowhere!</p>
<p align="center">All: Right!</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: I agree! This is a complete waste of time!</p>
<p align="center">Door: [Sound of Opening]</p>
<p align="center">Judith: They've arrested Brian!</p>
<p align="center">All: What? What?</p>
<p align="center">Judith: They dragged him off! They're gonna crucify him!</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Right! This calls for immediate discussion!</p>
<p align="center">Judith: What?</p>
<p align="center">Sibling: Immediate!</p>
<p align="center">Sibling II: Right!</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: New motion?</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Completely new motion! Uh, that, uh, that there be, uh, immediate
action...</p>
<p align="center">Francis: ...uh, once the vote has been taken.</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Well, obviously once the vote has been taken resolution the oh ----
resolution!</p>
<p align="center">Judith: Reg, let's go now, please!</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Right, right!In the - in the light of fresh information from sibling
Judith...</p>
<p align="center">Loretta: Ehm...not so fast, Reg.</p>
<p align="center">Judith: Reg, for God's sake! It's perfectly simple! All you've gotta do is to
go out of that door now and try to stop the</p>
<p align="center">Romans nailing him up! It's happening, Reg! Something's actually happening,
Reg! Can't you understand? Oooh!</p>
<p align="center">Door: [Sound of Closing]</p>
<p align="center">Reg: Yeah, hello. Another little ego trip from the feminists...</p>
